These comments are driven purely based on the questions that I've had to field from others.  - Since this advisory talks about 3 CVEs and then breaks the issue into 3 items SP1, SP2 and SP3 it would be helpful to directly map them to their CVEs. - There has been some confusion around mitigation and resolution where people misunderstand the terms and therefore there might be some value in providing some updates to provide some more clarity.  >  > SP1, "Bounds-check bypass": Poison the branch predictor, such that > operating system or hypervisor code is speculatively executed past > boundary and security checks.

I believe there has been some confusion among some people about the terms here. There are some people that understand "mitigation" as "what can I do now to avoid this" and "resolution" as "what updates can I apply". As a result they are misunderstanding here what the net result is. Some clarifications could be that the PVH shim is the resolution for the SP3 issue. However its not a fix for PV itself but instead changes the very nature of how PV guests are started up.   --  Doug Goldstein    Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
