Issue 1: isn't fixed  Issue 2: Using DBD::mysql with MariaDB or higher or MySQL 8.0 or higher provides a false sense of security  SSL_LAST_VERIFY_VERSION is set to Any version higher than that silently ignores mysql_ssl_verify_server_cert  This can lead to unencrypted connections even with strict SSL settings.  Issue 3: If SSL support is unavailable but ssl options are set then these options are silently ignored.  issue 4: If compiled against MySQL 5.7 then SSL/TLS is used when available, but can't be disabled. (mysql_ssl=0 is ignored).  This makes upgrading to 5.7 more difficult. And 5.7 is needed to get support for TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2.
