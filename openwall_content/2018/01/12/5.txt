If you're debating POSIX compliance, you should take  the whole system (kernel, libc, compiler, shell and what not...) into  account.  That said, it's true that the current behavior of the getcwd() syscall,  apart from being incredibly stupid, makes building a POSIX-compliant OS  on top of the Linux kernel harder than it could be.
