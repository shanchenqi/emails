So Apache Synapse or all previous releases 1.2, allows remote code execution attacks that can be performed by injecting specially crafted serialized objects. And the presence of Apache Commons Collections or previous versions in Synapse distribution makes this exploitable.  To mitigate the issue, we need to limit RMI access to trusted users only. To enforce authentication of users, we can configure a username and a password by setting following two parameters in synapse.properties file.  synapse.jmx.username synapse.jmx.password  Further upgrading to version will eliminate the risk of having said Commons Collection version. In Synapse Commons Collection has been updated to version.  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Comment: MacGPG2 - http://www.gpgtools.org/macgpg2.html  =/Vec -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  On Sun, Dec 10, at PM, Isuru Udana <isudana@...che.org> wrote: > -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- > Hash: > > Apache Synapse Remote Code Execution Vulnerability > > Severity: Important > > Vendor: > The Apache Software Foundation > > Versions Affected: > 1.2, > > Description: > > Due to the presence of Apache Commons Collections > or previous versions, > Apache Synapse or all previous releases allows remote code > execution attacks that can be performed by > injecting specially crafted serialized objects. > > Mitigation: > Upgrade to version. >     In Synapse version, Commons Collection has been updated to > version which contains >     the fix for the above mentioned vulnerability. > > Credit: > This issue was discovered by QingTeng cloud Security of Minded Security > Researcher jianan.huang > > > References: > https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-collections/security-reports.html > > Isuru Udana > VP, Apache Synapse > > -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- > Comment: MacGPG2 - http://www.gpgtools.org/macgpg2.html > > > > > > > > > > > > > > =Z+d2 > -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
