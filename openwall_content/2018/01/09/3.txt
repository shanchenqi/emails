Hi,  we are manufacturers of Turris Omnia routers and our approach to minimise those attacks is that on factory reset, your wan and wifi is disconnected till you setup your router. So your workflow after factory reset has to be connect localy via wire, setup your own password and then recommended steps are sugested in this order - setup wan, update, setup wifi. In theory somebody can beat you on LAN, but you should have enough common sense to disconect other computers if you are doing factory reset. You can also skip updates, but hey, you can setup passwordless wifi if you try hard enough (not easy that easy in our setup) and make your pasword We can't protect you from every mistake and there are usecases where it might make sense.   --  Sent from my Jolla device with K-9 Mail.
