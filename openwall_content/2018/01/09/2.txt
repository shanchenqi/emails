How grave it is?  Many OS installs/etc take a password during install, either manually (e.g. prompting you at the command line), or the OS is installed using tools that allow a password to be set (e.g. Red Hat kickstarter, Satellite, CloudForms).  In general if an OS install does NOT give you any way to set a password during install and forces you to install the product, boot it and then login with blank credentials and set a password you end up with a CVE since a network based attacker can easily win that race, a good example being FreeNAS If the installer can prompt for a password or take a password through other means (e.g. kickstarter) than there's a safe option so no CVE is needed typically.
