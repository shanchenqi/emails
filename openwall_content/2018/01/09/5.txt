How grave it is?  One thing to keep in mind: most operating systems can have their install media updated, e.g. Windows slipstream where you make an install media with all available updates, or you can install updates without a network trivially (e.g. for RPM/DPKG based systems just have a USB key with a copy of the updates and install them). To say nothing of using orchestration tools that essentially can take care of it themselves, or generating master images that are up to date (containers/Docker are a good example here, you want to deploy up to date containers and then refresh the entire container for updates, not run yum update inside of it, cattle not pets and all that).  Obviously things that don't support this add risk (e.g. you MUST connect to the internet to get updates), and if the update tools themselves have a problem, you have a major problem.
