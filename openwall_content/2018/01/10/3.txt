Versions affected: WebKitGTK+ before     Credit to Jann Horn of Google Project Zero; and Paul Kocher in     collaboration with Daniel Genkin of University of Pennsylvania and     University of Maryland, Daniel Gruss of Graz University of     Technology, Werner Haas of Cyberus Technology, Mike Hamburg of     Rambus (Cryptography Research Division), Moritz Lipp of Graz     University of Technology, Stefan Mangard of Graz University of     Technology, Thomas Prescher of Cyberus Technology, Michael Schwarz     of Graz University of Technology, and Yuval Yarom of University of     Adelaide and Data61.     Impact: Systems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution     and branch prediction may allow unauthorized disclosure of     information to an attacker via a side-channel analysis. This variant     of the Spectre vulnerability triggers the speculative execution by     performing a bounds-check bypass. Description: Security improvements     are included to mitigate the effects.

Impact: Systems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution     and branch prediction may allow unauthorized disclosure of     information to an attacker via a side-channel analysis. This variant     of the Spectre vulnerability triggers the speculative execution by     utilizing branch target injection. Description: Security     improvements are included to mitigate the effects.   We recommend updating to the last stable version of WebKitGTK+.
