The following  plugin releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * Ant plugin 1.8 * Checkstyle plugin * DRY plugin * FindBugs plugin * Pipeline: Nodes and Processes plugin * PMD plugin * Release plugin * Translation Assistance plugin * Warnings plugin  Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you find security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  (PMD) (Checkstyle) (DRY) (FindBugs) (Warnings) Multiple plugins based on the Static Analysis Utilities plugin are affected by  an XML External Entity (XXE) processing vulnerability. This allows attacker to  configure build processes so that one of these plugins parses a maliciously  crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the  Jenkins master, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.   Release plugin did not require form submissions to be submitted via POST,  resulting in a CSRF vulnerability allowing attackers to trigger release builds.   Translation Assistance did not require form submissions to be submitted via  POST, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability allowing attackers to override  localized strings displayed to all users on the current Jenkins instance if  the victim is a Jenkins administrator.   On instances with Authorize Project plugin, the authentication associated with  a build may lack the Computer/Build permission on some agents. This did not  prevent the execution of Pipeline `node` blocks on those agents due to  incorrect permissions checks in Pipeline: Nodes and Processes plugin.   and Ant plugin failed to escape tool names it shows on job configuration  screens, resulting in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that is  exploitable only by Jenkins administrators.  This is the same vulnerability that was announced without a fix on   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
