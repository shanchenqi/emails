This being a beta release series at present the preferred option is upgrade.  __________________________________________________________________      Squid Proxy Cache Security Update Advisory __________________________________________________________________  Advisory ID:        Date:               Jan 19, Summary:            Denial of Service issue                     in HTTP Message processing. Affected versions:  Squid 3.x ->                     Squid 4.x -> Fixed in version:   Squid __________________________________________________________________      __________________________________________________________________  Problem Description:   Due to incorrect pointer handling Squid is vulnerable to denial  of service attack when processing ESI responses or downloading  intermediate CA certificates.  __________________________________________________________________  Severity:   This problem allows a remote client delivering certain HTTP  requests in conjunction with certain trusted server responses to  trigger a denial of service for all clients accessing the Squid  service.  __________________________________________________________________  Updated Packages:   This bug is fixed by Squid version   In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable  releases can be found in our patch archives:  Squid 3.5:   Squid 4:    If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer  to the package vendor for availability information on updated  packages.  __________________________________________________________________  Determining if your version is vulnerable:   All Squid configured with "log_uses_indirect_client off" are not  vulnerable.   All Squid-3.0 versions built with --enable-esi and being used for  reverse-proxy with squid.conf containing  "log_uses_indirect_client on" are vulnerable.   All Squid-3.1 and later versions up to and including  being used for reverse-proxy with squid.conf  containing "log_uses_indirect_client on" are vulnerable.   All Squid-4 up to and including being used for  reverse-proxy with squid.conf containing  "log_uses_indirect_client on" are vulnerable.   All unpatched Squid-4 up to and including being  used for TLS/HTTPS intercept proxy with squid.conf containing  "log_uses_indirect_client on" are vulnerable.  __________________________________________________________________  Workarounds:   Configure "log_uses_indirect_client off" in squid.conf  __________________________________________________________________  Contact details for the Squid project:   For installation / upgrade support on binary packaged versions  of Squid: Your first point of contact should be your binary  package vendor.
