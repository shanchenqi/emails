Affected versions:  Squid 3.x ->                     Squid 4.x -> Fixed in version:   Squid __________________________________________________________________      __________________________________________________________________  Problem Description:   Due to incorrect pointer handling Squid is vulnerable to denial  of service attack when processing ESI responses.  __________________________________________________________________  Severity:   This problem allows a remote server delivering certain ESI  response syntax to trigger a denial of service for all clients  accessing the Squid service.   This problem is limited to the Squid custom ESI parser.  Squid built to use libxml2 or libexpat XML parsers do not have  this problem.  __________________________________________________________________  Updated Packages:   This bug is fixed by Squid version   In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable  releases can be found in our patch archives:  Squid 3.5:   Squid 4:    If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer  to the package vendor for availability information on updated  packages.  __________________________________________________________________  Determining if your version is vulnerable:   All Squid-2.x are not vulnerable.   All Squid built with --disable-esi are not vulnerable.   All Squid configured with "esi_parser expat" are not vulnerable.   All Squid configured with "esi_parser libxml2" are not  vulnerable.   All Squid-3.0 versions built without --enable-esi are not  vulnerable.   All Squid-3.0 versions built with --enable-esi and using  custom ESI parser for reverse-proxy are vulnerable.   All Squid-3.1 and later versions up to and including  being used for reverse-proxy are vulnerable.   All Squid-3.1 and later versions up to and including  being used for TLS / HTTPS interception are  vulnerable.   All unpatched Squid-4 up to and including being  used as reverse-proxy are vulnerable.   All unpatched Squid-4 up to and including being  used as TLS/HTTPS intercept proxy are vulnerable.  __________________________________________________________________  Workarounds:  Either;   Build Squid with --disable-esi  Or,   Build Squid with "--enable-esi --with-libxml2" and in squid.conf  configure "esi_parser libxml2"  Or,   Build Squid with "--enable-esi --with-expat" and in squid.conf  configure "esi_parser expat"  __________________________________________________________________  Contact details for the Squid project:   For installation / upgrade support on binary packaged versions  of Squid: Your first point of contact should be your binary  package vendor.   If your install and build Squid from the original Squid sources  then the squid-users@...ts.squid-cache.org mailing list is your  primary support point. For subscription details see  <http://www.squid-cache.org/Support/mailing-lists.html>.   For reporting of non-security bugs in the latest STABLE release  the squid bugzilla database should be used  <http://bugs.squid-cache.org/>.   For reporting of security sensitive bugs send an email to the  squid-bugs@...ts.squid-cache.org mailing list. It's a closed  list (though anyone can post) and security related bug reports  are treated in confidence until the impact has been established.  __________________________________________________________________  Credits:   The initial issue was reported by Louis Dion-Marcil on behalf of  GoSecure.
