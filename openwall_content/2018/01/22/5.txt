It never worked. Simply think that somebody else knows the secret and with your help continues using that.   "hiding intention for fame / paper publications / product selling" Hiding is not good. We are not monks and Security is not our God. Things like publications and selling require time and actually help to move things forward.

Point is, many "security researchers" overly pretend to work for security hiding intention for fame / paper publications / product selling.  Accept unnecessary long embargoes then you support this behaviour but might provide patches faster after public release. Reject unnecessary long embargoes then you discourage this behaviour but might provide patches slower after public release next time.  I think the decision is always individual per vulnerability weighting how grave/easy to find/abuse it is vs. how interested you are in future early reports. Keeping it individual without public announced maximum embargo time would also help prevent folks from jumping to 0daying everything per default:)  (Â°X|   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
