The symlink issue was fixed as far as I can tell -- I tried to exploit them, and failed. The tmpfiles code is using a clever trick:    xsprintf(fn, "/proc/self/fd/%i", fd);   ...   if (chown(fn, ...  On Linux, the proc stuff is magic, and that just does the right thing, even though a priori it looks like "chown" will follow symlinks.  Hard links were a different story, and there was no attempt made to avoid them outside of relying on the fs.protected_hardlinks sysctl. So if the administrator disables that protection, there's no safety net.  Did you cover the hard link problem in too? Regardless, there is now some extra protection built-in to tmpfiles to reduce the risk when the sysctl is disabled.
