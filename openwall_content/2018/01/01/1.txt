Apache OpenOffice was released on 19 Oct  - This release contained 4 security fixes that had not been reported to  this list at release time; they are listed below.   ## 1. Arbitrary file disclosure in Calc and Writer  By exploiting the way OpenOffice renders embedded objects, an attacker  could craft a document that allows reading in a file from the user's  filesystem. Information could be retrieved by the attacker by, e.g.,  using hidden sections to store the information, tricking the user into  saving the document and convincing the user to send the document back to  the attacker.  The vulnerability is mitigated by the need for the attacker to know the  precise file path in the target system, and the need to trick the user  into saving the document and sending it back.  Thanks to Ben Hayak for reporting this issue.   ## 2. Out-of-Bounds Write in Writer's WW8Fonts Constructor  A vulnerability in the OpenOffice Writer DOC file parser, and  specifically in the WW8Fonts Constructor, allows attackers to craft  malicious documents that cause denial of service (memory corruption and  application crash) potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution.  Thanks to Marcin 'Icewall' Noga of Cisco Talos for discovering this issue.   ## 3. Out-of-Bounds Write in Impress' PPT Filter  A vulnerability in OpenOffice's PPT file parser, and specifically in  PPTStyleSheet, allows attackers to craft malicious documents that cause  denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) potentially  resulting in arbitrary code execution.  Thanks to Marcin 'Icewall' Noga of Cisco Talos for discovering this issue.   ## 4. Out-of-Bounds Write in Writer's ImportOldFormatStyles  A vulnerability in OpenOffice Writer DOC file parser, and specifically  in ImportOldFormatStyles, allows attackers to craft malicious documents  that cause denial of service (memory corruption and application crash)  potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution.  Thanks to Marcin 'Icewall' Noga of Cisco Talos for discovering this issue.   See https://www.openoffice.org/security/bulletin.html for more information.
