Whenever we report security issues to upstream developers, we have no control over the process they use to resolve the issue.  In this case, the upstream author committed a partial fix to a public repo soon after we reported the problem. In my view, whenever an upstream author does this, you just consider the issue to be public whether or not official releases or announcements have been made.  I'll pass your feedback along to the upstream author though.
