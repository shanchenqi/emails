I will try responding to both here: well, however flawed it might be and oftentimes is in practice, there is the universal Hyppocrate's oath in the case of medicine and it sort of works. That is what I meant, using possibly inadequate words.  If boilerplate agreement sounds better than an universal code of ethics for our profession (and I think this is attainable, not "universal ethics" taken out of context, making it an oxymoron), as long as the effects are with it, I don't think that wording should be the main issue at hand.  As for the register's article, it gives this image - - in guise of a error, so I cannot make a proper opinion for the moment. Without reading it though, I cannot but see the parallel between Intel deactivating some CPU feature to make it secure and surgical ablation! There are (less mediatized) precedents of the like: see for instance how Apple had to remove Apple Pay history in a rush because it exposed an otherwise (provably?) secure enclave. What I do see in common here is that the end user's interests were sacrificed and some sold feature removed, to remedy a design flaw affecting the security of their information. If you remove the ICT Security professional glasses and take the more generic context of planned obsolescence into account, this becomes very interesting, and there are quite a few other examples of the like. Hence, a need probably arises to have an oath for ICT in general and not security in particular, sec. being what surgery is to general medicine, when not done preventively / by design, as we (CEuniX.world) and hopefully others are making every effort to do, instead of the "accept defeat" approach we hear so often from many vendors and even certification bodies, which is itself a reason to begin worrying about the status quo.  -------- Mensaje original -------- On 26 ene.
