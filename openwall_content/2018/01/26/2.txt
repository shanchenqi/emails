Anyone or any project may propose rules, and other projects are welcome to reuse those rules, but they must not have to - they could as well use different rules, or none.  At best, a relatively non-controversial and brief boilerplate could end up being reused by many projects.  > We as a profession should have a clear code of ethics  No.  Let's not use the word ethics.  That word, except when explicitly referring to a particular person's or group's ethics, implies that when we (dis)agree or are judging others, we claim to be necessarily right - but in reality we're necessarily subjective.  This would be just as flawed a concept/term as "responsible disclosure". (I refrain from using that term as well, except when pointing out just how unnecessarily judgemental it is - implying that other kinds of disclosure would have been "irresponsible" - but we're subjective.)  > universal ethics' code  That's an oxymoron.  No such thing can possibly exist.  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
