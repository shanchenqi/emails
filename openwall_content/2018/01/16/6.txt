If successfully exploited the attacker can prevent the operator from being able to connect to the server, for example to change server state or to add lease reservations without restarting the server.  Since an unauthorized client should not be permitted access to this port under normal circumstances, we are recommending that most operators should simply secure access to the control port; however a patch which properly cleans up the hung socket descriptors is available upon request (and will be included in future maintenance releases.)
