We (Red Hat) respect the embargo request (although we will often try to negotiate something a bit more sensible if they make a really awkward request), but ultimately we want the researchers to come to us, if we annoy them to much they might stop coming to us and just drop their results as a 0day at the conference with no heads up.  > The obvious approach is to find a prior public report of essentially the > same bug and fix that (which will work surprisingly often), but let's assume > that this isn't the case.  I'm not sure this is a sustainable approach as researchers who want to make a name for themselves are faced with the "well if I tell them, they'll try to ignore my embargo request" which incentivizes them to not do a coordinated disclosure.  > > Thanks, > Florian    --   Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
