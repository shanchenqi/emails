Hi there,  Speaking for myself from a security researcher's perspective, I would say it depends on the reason for embargo, and what ends up protecting users better.  There might be valid reasons for embargoes - one example (but not the only one) is when a given bug affects multiple similar products, and a disclosure on the side of one product would 0-day users using other products. It sounds logical to wait until fixes are available before disclosure (keeping in mind at the same time that a certain sane deadline must be met too).  On the other hand there are reasons for embargoes which I don't find valid, where the examples you've given ("paper/conference presentation/patent submission") fall into this category. They don't sound as something that would benefit users' security (please correct me if I'm wrong) and I'm not a big fan of sitting on already discovered unpatched security bugs (in the end bug discovery might be a function of time for all we know).  In this case I would consider explaining this to the researcher and proceeding with patching. In the end if this causes a given person to report a known-to-them bug just before a conference/etc it changes little vs. actually waiting for the proposed just-before-conference/etc deadline anyway (if accepting the embargo agreement that is).
