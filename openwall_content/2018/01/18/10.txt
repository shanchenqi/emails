That's not ideal, but I think it's better than having no > maximum embargo time specified.  I generally agree with this, but it also creates the risk that reporters  will simply wait till the maximum time frame fits within their desired  reporting time.  Which of course delays the reporting of the bug to the  vendor/project. What I have seen in the past is a negotiated partial  disclosure where the patch is released with minimum details with the  line that says "Full details with be released by XXX at YYY conference."  That way if ego is the factor then the reporter also gets a slight  teaser for his/her talk. Of course one could just use the patch to get  the details depending on the issue.  --Nicholas Luedtke HPE Cyber Security      Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
