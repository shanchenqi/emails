I'm also not a huge fan of embargoes for conferences. It did happen for Debian  so we discussed that issues with the security researchers to make the fix happens rather sooner than later.   One important thing, in my opinion, is that conferences should also encourage their speakers to actively coordinate with vendors in order for things to be fixed *before* and published either before or just for the conference. It might be wishful thinking but I'm not sure conferences organizers are really thrilled when a 0day is dumped right before the audience during the talk (pwn2own might be an exception though).
