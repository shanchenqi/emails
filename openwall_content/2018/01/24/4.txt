When asked to send custom headers in its HTTP requests, libcurl will send that set of headers first to the host in the initial URL but also, if asked to follow redirects and a 30X HTTP response code is returned, to the host mentioned in URL in the `Location:` response header value.  Sending the same set of headers to subsequest hosts is in particular a problem for applications that pass on custom `Authorization:` headers, as this header often contains privacy sensitive information or data that could allow others to impersonate the libcurl-using client's request.  We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.  INFO ----  This bug has existed since before curl 6.0. It existed in the first commit we have recorded in the project.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name to this issue.  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  - Affected versions: libcurl 7.1 to and including - Not affected versions: libcurl >=  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such.  THE SOLUTION ------------  In libcurl version custom `Authorization:` headers will be limited the same way other such headers is controlled within libcurl: they will only be sent to the host used in the original URL unless libcurl is told that it is ok to pass on to others using the `CURLOPT_UNRESTRICTED_AUTH` option.  **NOTE**: this solution creates a slight change in behavior. Users who actually want to pass on the header to other hosts now need to give curl that specific permission. You do this with [--location-trusted](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html#--location-trusted) with the curl command line tool.  A [patch for is available.  RECOMMENDATIONS ---------------  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:    A - Upgrade curl to version    B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild    C - Do not enable CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION if you pass on custom Authorization       headers  TIME LINE ---------  It was reported to the curl project on January 18,  We contacted distros@...nwall on January 19.  curl was released on January 24 coordinated with the publication of this advisory.
