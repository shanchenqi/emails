The YARN NodeManager can leak the password for credential store provider used by the NodeManager to YARN Applications.  If you use the CredentialProvider feature to encrypt passwords used in NodeManager configs, it may be possible for any Container launched by that NodeManager to gain access to the encryption password. The other passwords themselves are not directly exposed.  Mitigation: and users should upgrade to If you cannot upgrade to the latest version, set the permission of the jceks file appropriately to restrict access from unauthorized users.
