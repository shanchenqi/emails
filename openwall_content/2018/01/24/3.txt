It was that reading an HTTP/2 trailer could mess up future trailers since the stored size was one byte less than required.  The problem is that the code that creates HTTP/1-like headers from the HTTP/2 trailer data once appended a string like `":"` to the target buffer, while this was recently changed to `": "` (a space was added after the colon) but the associated math wasn't updated correspondingly.  When accessed, the data is read out of bounds and causes either a crash or that the (too large) data gets passed to the libcurl callback. This might lead to a denial-of-service situation or an information disclosure if someone has a service that echoes back or uses the trailers for something.  We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.  INFO ----  This bug was introduced in commit May 11  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name to this issue.  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  - Affected versions: libcurl to and including - Not affected versions: libcurl < and >=  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such.  THE SOLUTION ------------  In libcurl version the allocation size is corrected.  A [patch for is available.  RECOMMENDATIONS ---------------  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:    A - Upgrade curl to version    B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild  TIME LINE ---------  It was publicly [reported to the curl on January 10,  The security impact was realized and assessed on January 11. The fix was merged publicly in git on the same day, not mentioning the security impact.  We contacted distros@...nwall on January 17.  curl was released on January 24 coordinated with the publication of this advisory.  CREDITS -------  Reported and patched by Zhouyihai Ding.
