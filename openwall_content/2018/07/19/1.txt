The vulnerability affects Apache Ignite users who us Spring Data REST for access an Ignite cluster via HTTP and Spring Data. Spring Data Commons, versions prior to to 2.0 to and older unsupported versions, contain a property binder vulnerability caused by improper neutralization of special elements. An unauthenticated remote malicious user (or attacker) can supply specially crafted request parameters against Spring Data REST backed HTTP resources or using Spring Data's projection-based request payload binding hat can lead to a remote code execution attack.  Mitigation:  * Upgrade to Apache Ignite 2.6 or later that include Spring Data Commons versions not vulnerable to the disclosed issue.  Credit: * Harendra Rai of NCR Corporation discovered the impact of the existing vulnerability on Apache Ignite.
