Description: Apache Ignite serialization mechanism does not have a list of classes allowed for serialization/deserialization, which makes it possible to run arbitrary code when 3-rd party vulnerable classes are present in Ignite classpath. The vulnerability can be exploited if the one sends a specially prepared form of a serialized object to GridClientJdkMarshaller deserialization endpoint.  Mitigation: â˘    All Ignite versions: make sure there are no vulnerable classes among your custom code used in Apache Ignite. â˘    Ignite 2.5 or earlier users: upgrade to Ignite 2.6 and use IGNITE_MARSHALLER_WHITELIST and/or IGNITE_MARSHALLER_BLACKLIST system properties to define classes allowed for deserialization.
