When sending data over SMTP, curl allocates a separate "scratch area" on the heap to be able to escape the uploaded data properly if the uploaded data contains data that requires it.  The size of this temporary scratch area was mistakenly made to be `2 * sizeof(download_buffer)` when it should have been made `2 * sizeof(upload_buffer)`.  The upload and the download buffer sizes are identically sized by default (16KB) but since version curl can resize the download buffer into a smaller buffer (as well as larger). If the download buffer size is set to a value smaller than the `Curl_smtp_escape_eob()` function might overflow the scratch buffer when sending contents of sufficient size and contents.  The curl command line tool lowers the buffer size when `--limit-rate` is set to a value smaller than 16KB.  We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.  TEST CASES ---------- Here's a shell script       # Setup an SMTP end-point, make file, run curl      $ printf SIZE send data\n' | nc -l -p >/dev/null &      $ printf > mail.txt      $ curl -v --mail-from me --mail-rcpt root@...alhost --upload-file mail.txt --limit-rate  PHP code:       <?php      $ch = curl_init();      curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL,      curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_BUFFERSIZE,      curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_UPLOAD, 1);      curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_MAIL_FROM, "me");      curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_MAIL_RCPT, ["root@...alhost"]);      curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_VERBOSE, 1);      $eof = false;      curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_READFUNCTION, function($ch, $stream, $maxSize) {          global $eof;          echo "Max Size: [$maxSize]\n";          if ($eof) {              return "";          }          $eof = true;          return str_repeat(" ", $maxSize);      });      curl_exec($ch);      curl_close($ch);  INFO ----  This bug was introduced in April in [this when we introduced support for buffer resize. The scratch buffer was mistakenly made to use the dynamic size when it should kept using the fixed upload buffer size.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name to this issue.  Heap-based Buffer Overflow  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  - Affected versions: curl to and including curl - Not affected versions: curl < and curl >=  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such.  THE SOLUTION ------------  In curl version curl will use the upload buffer size as base for the scratch area allocation.  A [patch for is available.  RECOMMENDATIONS ---------------  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:    A - Upgrade curl to version    B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild    C - Avoid using SMTP uploads with CURLOPT_BUFFERSIZE set below  TIME LINE ---------  It was reported to the curl project on June 11,  We contacted distros@...nwall on July X,  curl was released on July 11 coordinated with the publication of this advisory.  CREDITS -------  Detected and researched by Peter Wu. Patch by Daniel Stenberg.
