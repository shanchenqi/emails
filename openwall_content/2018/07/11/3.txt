'The v4l2_file_operations struct is a subset of file_operations. The main difference is that the inode argument is omitted since it is never used.' # ls /dev/video0crw-rw---- 1 root video 81, 0 Jul 11 /dev/video0 commit file_mmap_size_max check conditions:1.

Always use the scripts/get_maintainer.pl tool to find who to send stuff like this to.  It will include a public mailing list or two. > I don't think > commit  will work on this case, this driver derived from > v4l2-core which not use inode,  maybe i'm wrong.
