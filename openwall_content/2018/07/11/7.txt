Via settings like `editor.command`, this possibly allowed websites to execute arbitrary code.  This issue has been assigned  Affected versions -----------------  The issue was introduced in as part of commit ffc29ee. https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/commit/ffc29ee  It was fixed in the release, in commit  All releases between and (inclusive) are affected. Backported patches are available, but no additional releases are planned:  v1.1.x: v1.2.x: v1.3.x: v1.4.x: master:  (add .patch to the URL to get patches)  Timeline --------  I was made aware of the original issue privately (initially believed by the reporter to only be a DoS issue), developed a fix and contacted the distros Openwall mailinglist to organize a disclosure date to give distributions time to coordinate releasing of a fix.  Slightly updated patch sent to the distros mailinglist.  Public disclosure.  Mitigation ----------  Please upgrade to or apply the patches above.  Note that disabling loading of `autoconfig.yml` is not a suitable remedy, since settings are still applied until the next restart.  As a workaround, it's possible to patch out the vulnerable code via a `config.py` file:      from qutebrowser.browser import qutescheme     qutescheme._qute_settings_set = lambda url: ('text/html', '')  While there is no known exploit for this in the wild, users are advised to check their `autoconfig.yml` file (located in the config folder shown in `:version`) for any unwanted modifications.
