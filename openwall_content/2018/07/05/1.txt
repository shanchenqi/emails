But since we generally publish BIND Security Advisories to this list, I thought we should also provide this Operational Notification (which is our term for an issue which does not rise to the level of a disclosable security vulnerability under our policy but which has enough potential operational impact that we feel operators and packagers should be made aware.)  Sincerely,  Michael McNally ISC Security Officer  ----  BIND Operational Notification: Extremely large zone transfers can result in corrupted journal files or server process termination  Summary:     In versions of BIND released prior to July (before BIND    and BIND it is possible    for extraordinarily large zone transfers to cause several related    problems, with possible outcomes including corrupted journal    files or server exit due to assertion failure.  Posting date:        03 July Program Impacted:    BIND Versions affected:   9.0.x -> -> ->                      -> -> and versions                      -> of the development branch  Description:     A problem in named can potentially lead to corrupted journal    files when handling extraordinarily large zone transfers.  Impact:     This problem potentially affects authoritative servers providing    slave service for zones if the server accepts zone data via    incremental zone transfer (IXFR) from a master source or if a    large zone transfer (AXFR) is received and ixfr-from-differences    is not set to "no" (the default setting is "yes", and possible    values are "yes", "no", "slave", and "master").     We warned of a similar class of problems in in this previous    Operational Notification "A party that is allowed control over    zone data can overwhelm a server by transferring huge quantities    of data."  Workarounds:     Like any unvalidated input, zone transfers are a potential source    of risk for servers under any circumstances.  BIND therefore    supports a variety of mechanisms to control zone transfer    permissions.  Permission to transfer can be restricted to trusted    servers using IP-address-based ACLs or shared secrets (TSIG keys)    or both.  Under most circumstances a slave server should not    encounter this defect when receiving data from a trusted server,    but it can be prevented entirely by forbidding incremental zone    transfer as a zone data transfer mechanism.  It may be preferable    to instead set a reasonable limit for the number of records which    may be in a zone (using the max-records parameter) which should    also prevent accidentally encountering this defect.     Servers which must accept zone data from untrusted sources (for    example, when seconding zones for other parties) are at slightly    higher risk if a party decides to deliberately feed a dangerously    large zone transfer.  Operators of servers which must accept    untrusted zone data should consider limiting zone size using    max-records, setting "ixfr-from-differences no;", or upgrading    to a version of BIND which will reject dangerously large transfers.  Active exploits:     No known active exploits.  Solution:     It is our opinion that most customers do not need to worry about    this issue unless they accept zone data via zone transfer from    untrusted sources, but we have included changes in upcoming    maintenance releases of BIND which will prevent the condition    from being reached.     Maintenance releases of BIND issued on or after 4 July will    contain change which will cause BIND to reject an    extraordinarily large IXFR if it is potentially large enough to    corrupt the journal file. These release candidates are available    now via https://www.isc.org/downloads and the change will be    included in future versions of BIND      BIND 9 version     BIND 9 version     BIND 9 version     BIND 9 version   Do you still have questions?
