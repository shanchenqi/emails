It comes with a daemon running as root (blueman-mechanism) that performs privileged operations.  During a code review [2] I noticed that blueman-mechanism in the stable version of blueman does not enforce the polkit action 'org.blueman.network.setup' for which a polkit policy is shipped. This means that any user with access to the D-Bus system bus is able to access the related API without authentication.  The result is an unspecified impact on the networking stack. blueman-mechanism for example sets up a bridge device, changes system wide IPv4 forwarding settings and runs a DHCP client like dnsmasq, dhclient or dhcpcd.  After I contacted upstream about this, they released an updated stable version blueman containing a set of backported patches that address this issue. These patches have already been present in the alpha version branch of blueman for a longer time.
