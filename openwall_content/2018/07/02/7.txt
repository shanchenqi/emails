It's specifically documented not to do any blocking I/O, and might provide syntactic canonicalisation (the documentation doesn't specifically say either way) but does not provide filesystem-aware canonicalisation. The documentation also specifically says that the returned path "might contain symlinks".  It might be a good idea to double-check that the result of g_file_get_path() starts with "/", doesn't contain "/../" and (just for completeness) doesn't end with "/..".      smcv  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
