These icon files are written to the respective user's $HOME/.face location. If an unprivileged user prepares a symlink pointing to an arbitrary location then this location will be overwritten with the icon content. This vulnerability thus allows to corrupt the system or other user's files. The content is not attacker controlled, luckily. It may have further unspecified impact, however, by allowing to write to pseudo files in /proc or /sys or by creating state files that influence other system components like /etc/suid-debug.  Affected Versions:  From the git history it looks like this vulnerability was contained for a long time in the cinnamon-settings-users.py script, dating back to version up to and including current version  Suggested Fix:  Dropping privileges to the target user while writing the $HOME/.face file should be a safe approach. A preliminary suggested patch is found in the pull request referenced below and is also attached to this mail.
