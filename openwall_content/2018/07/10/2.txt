There is no impact in their application, the API remains unchanged.  The previous version (LDAP API was a workaround for this problem.  History: Original advisory  Credit: This issue has been reported by Wei Deng (Datastax), the initial workaround was proposed by Mike Adamson (Datastax) and the further investigations/tests/verification were conducted by Wei Deng, Mike Adamson, Jeremiah Kordan (Datastax) and Ben Coverston (Datastax).   --  Regards, Cordialement, Emmanuel LĂŠcharny www.iktek.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
