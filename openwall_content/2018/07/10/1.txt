This could lead to leakage of sensitive information between tenants.  ### Affected Services / Software ### Cinder releases up to and including Queens with ScaleIO volumes using thin volumes and zero padding.  ### Discussion ### Using both thin volumes and zero padding does not ensure data contained in a volume is actually deleted. The default volume provisioning rule is set to thick so most installations are likely not affected. Operators can check their configuration in `cinder.conf` or check for zero padding with this command `scli --query_all`.  #### Recommended Actions ####  Operators can use the following two workarounds, until the release of Rocky (planned 30th August which resolves the issue.  1. Swap to thin volumes  2. Ensure ScaleIO storage pools use zero-padding with:  `scli --modify_zero_padding_policy     (((--protection_domain_id <ID> |     --protection_domain_name <NAME>)     --storage_pool_name <NAME>) | --storage_pool_id <ID>)     (--enable_zero_padding | --disable_zero_padding)`  ### Contacts / References ### Author: Nick Tait This OSSN : Original LaunchPad Bug : Mailing List : [Security] tag on openstack-dev@...ts.openstack.org OpenStack Security Project : https://launchpad.net/~openstack-ossg     Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
