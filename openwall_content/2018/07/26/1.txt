Begin forwarded message:  Date: Thu, 26 Jul From: Stuart Caie Subject: New cabextract 1.7 and libmspack 0.7 release   Hello all,  cabextract 1.7 has been released.  It fixes a few bugs, an introduces a new "--encoding" option, which is  made available if the iconv() function and/or libiconv library are  available on your system. It also now tries calling setlocale() (if  present) with several possible locales that have a UTF-8 ctype, to allow towlower() (if present) to lowercase non-ASCII characters.  cabextract can be downloaded from https://www.cabextract.org.uk/  sums:     cabextract-1.7.tar.gz  libmspack 0.7alpha has also been released. It fixes several bugs:  * bad KWAJ file header extensions could cause a one or two byte   overwrite * The character in a CHM filename could cause a one-byte overread * libmspack now rejects blank CHM filenames. * Fixed off-by-one error in CHM PMGI/PMGL chunk number validity checks,  which could cause a crash by dereferencing uninitialised data beyond   the end of the fast_find() chunk cache.  libmspack can be downloaded from https://www.cabextract.org.uk/libmspack/  sum:   libmspack-0.7alpha.tar.gz  Regards Stuart   --  Hanno Bรถck https://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
