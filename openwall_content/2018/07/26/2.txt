Given its upstream state I considered forking squirrelmail, though I reached out to the maintainer and he claims he's still actively working on it. I sent him a couple of patches, but they're not applied yet.  For now I'm sharing the patches I use on my own installations: https://github.com/hannob/squirrelpatches  This contains a security fix for the known XSS issues and hopefully a few more (though I make no claims that this is safe from XSS now, I'd appreciate if others could check). It also contains patches for PHP warnings and issues with PHP 7.2.
