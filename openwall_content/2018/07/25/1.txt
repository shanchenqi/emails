Normally in this failsafe callback, error_entry is paired with error_exit; and error_entry uses %ebx to communicate to error_exit whether to use the user or kernel return path.  Unfortunately, on 64-bit PV Xen on x86, error_exit is called without error_entry being called first, leaving %ebx with an invalid value.  IMPACT ======  A rogue user-space program could crash a guest kernel.  Privilege escalation cannot be ruled out.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Only 64-bit x86 PV Linux systems are vulnerable.  All versions of Linux are vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  Switching to HVM or PVH guests will mitigate this issue.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by M. Vefa Bicakci, and recognized as a security issue by Andy Lutorminski.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.  NB this patch has not been accepted into Linux upstream yet.  An updated advisory will be sent if the fix upstreamed looks significantly different.            Linux  $  $  NOTE ON THE LACK OF EMBARGO ===========================  The patch for this issue was published on linux-kernel without being first reported to the XenProject Security Team.  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----  =7MDt -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
