The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * AccuRev Plugin * Agiletestware Pangolin Connector for TestRail Plugin 2.2 * Anchore Container Image Scanner Plugin * Confluence Publisher Plugin * Inedo BuildMaster Plugin 2.0 * Inedo ProGet Plugin 1.0 * Kubernetes Plugin * Maven Artifact ChoiceListProvider (Nexus) Plugin * meliora-testlab Plugin * Publish Over CIFS Plugin * Resource Disposer Plugin * SaltStack Plugin * Shelve Project Plugin 2.0 * SSH Agent Plugin * Tinfoil Security Plugin 2.0 * TraceTronic ECU-TEST Plugin 2.4  Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  When using the `sshagent` step inside a `withDockerContainer` block in  Pipeline, the resulting logging of the `ssh-add` command included the SSH  key passphrase in plain text.   Resource Disposer Plugin did not perform permission checks on an API  endpoint. This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to stop  tracking a specified resource.  Additionally, this API endpoint did not require POST requests, resulting  in a CSRF vulnerability.   Publish Over CIFS Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method  implementing form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access  to Jenkins to initiate CIFS connections to an attacker specified host.  Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests,  resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.   Confluence Publisher Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method  implementing form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access  to Jenkins to submit login requests to Confluence using attacker- specified credentials.  Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests,  resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.   Kubernetes Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method  implementing form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access  to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified Kubernetes cluster using  attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method,  capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.  Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests,  resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.   Tinfoil Security Plugin stored the API Secret Key in its configuration  unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins master. This  key could be viewed by users with access to the master file system.   TraceTronic ECU-TEST Plugin unconditionally disabled SSL/TLS certificate  validation for the entire Jenkins master JVM.   TraceTronic ECU-TEST Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method  implementing form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access  to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL, with the path suffix `/app-version-info` appended.  Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests,  resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.   SaltStack Plugin did not perform permission checks on methods implementing  form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to  connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials  IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in  Jenkins, and to cause Jenkins to submit HTTP requests to attacker- specified URLs.  Additionally, these form validation methods did not require POST requests,  resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.   Accurev Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing  form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to  connect to an attacker-specified Accurev server using attacker-specified  credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials  stored in Jenkins.  Additionally, these form validation methods did not require POST requests,  resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.   Shelve Project Plugin did not escape the names of shelved projects on the  UI, potentially resulting in a stored XSS vulnerability.   Maven Artifact ChoiceListProvider (Nexus) Plugin did not perform  permission checks on a method implementing form validation. This allowed  users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker- specified Nexus or Artifactory server using attacker-specified credentials  IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in  Jenkins.  Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests,  resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.   meliora-testlab Plugin stored the API Key in its configuration unencrypted  in its global configuration file on the Jenkins master. This key could be  viewed by users with access to the master file system.  Additionally, the API key was not masked from view using a password form  field.   Agiletestware Pangolin Connector for TestRail Plugin did not perform  permission checks on an API endpoint used to validate and save the plugin  configuration. This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to  override the plugin configuration.  Additionally, the API endpoint did not require POST requests, resulting in  a CSRF vulnerability.   Anchore Container Image Scanner Plugin stored the password in its  configuration unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins  master. This password could be viewed by users with access to the master  file system.   Inedo ProGet Plugin unconditionally disabled SSL/TLS certificate  validation for the entire Jenkins master JVM.   Inedo ProGet Plugin unconditionally disabled SSL/TLS certificate validation  for the entire Jenkins master JVM.
