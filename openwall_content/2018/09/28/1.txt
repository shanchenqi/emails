We've got a tool called fedora- review[0] that is maybe kinda similar to quilt. It uses mock[1] to build the source RPM (and mock does this in a chroot to help with the problems you described) and then it does some basic quality checks on the RPM afterwards.  I'm not sure how generic mock is, but maybe it would be helpful to you. Its wiki page describes it as being used by Mageia, so it might be extensible for SUSE as well.  Happy coding!
