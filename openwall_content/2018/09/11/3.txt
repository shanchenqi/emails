Call end user 3. The access log on CLI reveals the end user public IP address.  By default in tdesktop p2p is enable, which open a direct communication when calling to the other user, potentially seeing his/her IP. Telegram is supposedly is a secure messaging application but while calling another user leaks his/her public IP address in access log. However, by navigating to Settings and Privacy  > Calls > and set P2P to `nobody` in telegram apps in (iOS and android) will not allow others to view public IP of end user, but this option is still not available in tdesktop, which makes tdesktop vulnerable to this issue.
