Severity: Important  Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation  Versions Affected: Apache Mesos to The unsupported Apache Mesos releases may be also affected.  Description: Apache Mesos can be configured to require authentication to call the Executor HTTP API using JSON Web Token (JWT). The comparison of the generated HMAC value against the provided signature in the JWT implementation used is vulnerable to a timing attack because instead of a constant-time string comparison routine a standard `==` operator has been used. A malicious actor can therefore abuse the timing difference of when the JWT validation function returns to reveal the correct HMAC value.  Mitigation: pre-1.4.x users should upgrade to at least 1.4.x users should upgrade to 1.5.x users should upgrade to users should upgrade to users should obtain Mesos  Credit: This issue was discovered by Terry Chia (Ayrx).
