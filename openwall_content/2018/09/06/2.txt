In addition to that, pdf files can contains things like javascript... There are some python tools to analyze them and detect (even obfuscated JS) -- see [1] and links therein. But yes, unless you generate a pdf/ps file yourself (e.g. with pdflatex or a graphics program), you should consider it untrusted.  Cheers, L.
