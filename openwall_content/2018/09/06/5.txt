Currently, evince, okular and gv don't. The same goes for zathura with its poppler backend (haven't checked this, but pretty sure). But then there is also Artifex Mupdf which, AFAIR, supports JS in pdf files (by extension, so does zathura when viewing a pdf file using the mupdf plugin). I don't know how complete that support is. Most importantly, many Android pdf/ebook readers probably include JS support.
