Ah, fair enough. Thanks for clarifying this, you're making good points. The robustness issue is indeed something I completely disregarded.  Luckily, we've already arrived at a point where keys can be as short as hash values. keys are 32 bytes, i.e., the same length as a hash. So there's that :-)  All the best, Cheers, Joe  --  "A PC without Windows is like a chocolate cake without mustard."
