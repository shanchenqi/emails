Let's say we're talking about then we have a security level of around bit. Bruteforcing a second preimage SHA-1 (pretending it's an ideal hash function for a second) would have complexity of around bit. I.e., even for it would be easier to create the *identical* private key by factoring the modulus (thus obviously creating a keypair with the identical fingerprint) than just randomly generating keypairs and checking their private key hash.  I.e., my point was that for a given key that's uploaded with a fixed fingerprint, we're not talking about 2^(b/2) collision complexity, but 2^(b-1) second preimage complexity.  > However, if someone hadn't considered the possibility of a SHA1 collision attack, and a signature verification fails, despite the fingerprint they see matching, what % of GPG users would skip signature verification? > Perhaps due to confusion/self-doubt/inexperience/other. > Admittedly, this could be stepping into the realm of social engineering.  I think the attacker model that Daniel referred to was that someone states "my key's fingerprint is XYZ" and someone downloading a forged, same-fingerprint key from the keyserver.
