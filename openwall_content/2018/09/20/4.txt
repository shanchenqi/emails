In short:  Applies to named, when running, with a specific option set  [1]  The OVAL [2] dictionaries (which are consumed by vulnerability scanners)  for RedHat (and derivatives) [3],[4] lists the following packages as  affected  bind bind-chroot bind-devel bind-libs bind-libs-lite bind-license bind-lite-devel bind-pkcs11 bind-pkcs11-devel bind-pkcs11-libs bind-pkcs11-utils bind-sdb bind-sdb-chroot bind-utils  named is only contained in the bind package, and this list is causing no  end of problems on hosts that, for example, only want bind-utils and  dependencies (of which bind -containing named- is not).  Could whoever maintains these take a look?  thank you for you time  [1] [2] https://oval.mitre.org [3] https://www.redhat.com/security/data/oval/ [4] https://linux.oracle.com/security/oval/  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
