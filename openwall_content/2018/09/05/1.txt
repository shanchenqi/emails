The internal function `Curl_ntlm_core_mk_nt_hash` multiplies the `length` of the password by two (SUM) to figure out how large temporary storage area to allocate from the heap.  The `length` value is then subsequently used to iterate over the password and generate output into the allocated storage buffer. On systems with a 32 bit `size_t`, the math to calculate SUM triggers an integer overflow when the password length exceeds 2GB bytes). This integer overflow usually causes a very small buffer to actually get allocated instead of the intended very huge one, making the use of that buffer end up in a heap buffer overflow.  (This bug is almost identical to  We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.  INFO ----  This bug was introduced in commit April  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name to this issue.  Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  This issue is only present on 32 bit systems. It also requires the password field to use more than 2GB of memory, which should be rare.  - Affected versions: libcurl to and including - Not affected versions: libcurl < and >=  curl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such.  THE SOLUTION ------------  In libcurl version the integer overflow is avoided.  A [patch for is available.  RECOMMENDATIONS ---------------  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:    A - Upgrade curl to version    B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild    C - Put length restrictions on the password you can pass to libcurl  TIME LINE ---------  It was [publicly to the curl project on July 18,  We contacted distros@...nwall on August 27.  curl was released on September 5 coordinated with the publication of this advisory.
