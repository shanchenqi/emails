However, please be aware that including essential information only by reference is against list content guidelines here:  https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security#list-content-guidelines  which include:  "At least the most essential part of your message (e.g., vulnerability detail and/or exploit) should be directly included in the message itself (and in plain text), rather than only included by reference to an external resource.  Posting links to relevant external resources as well is acceptable, but posting only links is not.  Your message should remain valuable even with all of the external resources gone."  To correct this, I've attached the entire text file from the URL above, with the typo corrected as you mentioned in your follow-up message.
