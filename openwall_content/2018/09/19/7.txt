It is also possible to add a new message, change the priority, close and reopen a support ticket as another customer than the owner of the support ticket.   Until now there is no corrected version of Froxlor available, because the main developer has no spare time to release a new version nor to inform users about the fixes for three months. It's also not foreseeable when a corrected version will be released.  But Froxlor users can manually patch these issues by replacing customer_tickets.php and lib/classes/ticket/class.ticket.php with the corrected ones from and   I've decided to post about these security issues, because I think it is better that Froxlor users know that fixes for security issues are available, even if there is no corrected version released yet.   Fixes:   Timeline: Issues discovered and reported Issues confirmed and partial fixed Issues fixed; Response summarized: Developer needs a few days for a new release Asked when developer plan to release a new version Response summarized: Developer wait until package builder is available again Notified the developer about posting on to inform Froxlor users Response summarized: Lack of understanding regarding a posting. I should give users a chance to update. Developer has no spare time to release a new version.   --  chbi https://chbi.eu  GPG: 3DE9 4BE9 EAE6 3CA8  DC20 BA7B AE7E      https://chbi.eu/chbi.asc    Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
