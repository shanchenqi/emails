In this case, I'm just 99% sure it's non-security.  Maybe someone will see a way to make this cross a privilege boundary, which the above example doesn't appear to do.  Even with distribution of a malicious theme file (just guessing here as the example above is unclear on what file is involved nor on what exactly causes the crash) from one user to others, this doesn't appear to be a security issue as the impact would have been a mere crash (since the out of range index is properly detected), which looks irrelevant as a security attack in that scenario.  For this to be a security issue, a privilege boundary would need to be crossed _and_ either the impact needs to be worse than a mere crash or the attack would need to be performed without target user's interaction.  If someone finds a way to _avoid_ the detected "index out of range" condition yet have the program misbehave differently, that will be more valuable as a potential attack.
