Apache Karaf unsecure access to Gogo shell in the webconsole  Severity: Moderate  Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation  Versions Affected: all versions of Apache Karaf prior to  Description:  When the webconsole feature is installed in Karaf, it is available at .../system/console and requires authentication to access it.  One part of the console is a Gogo shell/console that gives access to the command line console of Karaf via a Web browser, and when navigated to it is available at .../system/console/gogo.  Trying to go directly to that URL does require authentication.  And optional bundle that some applications use is the Pax Web Extender Whiteboard, it is part of the pax-war feature and perhaps others. When it is installed, the Gogo console becomes available at another URL .../gogo/, and that URL is not secured giving access to the Karaf console to unauthenticated users.  A mitigation for the issue is to manually stop/uninstall Gogo plugin bundle that is installed with the webconsole feature, although of course this removes the console from the .../system/console application, not only from the unauthenticated endpoint.  One could also stop/uninstall the Pax Web Extender Whiteboard, but other components/applications may require it and so their functionality would be reduced/compromised.  This has been fixed in revision:   Mitigation: Apache Karaf users should upgrade to or later as soon as possible.
