With certain non-default but non-rare configuration of a victim host an attacker can trigger this crash remotely, thus leading to a remote denial-of-service.  The CVE-ID was assigned to this flaw and we would suggest to use it in the public communications.  Reference:  The flaw was introduced in:  $ git tag --contain  and fixed in:  $ git tag --contain  The fix is the upstream commit ("ip: frags: fix crash in ip_do_fragment()") and it is fixing ("ip: use rb trees for IP frag queue."). Namely, the following part of which unions sk and ip_defrag_offset fields of struct sk_buff has introduced the vulnerability:  +++ b/include/linux/skbuff.h @@ @@ struct sk_buff { + +       union { +               struct sock             *sk; +               int                     ip_defrag_offset; +       };  Distributions which has backported this part of (which in turn is a part of the fix of the are vulnerable.  For the remote attack masquerading and forwarding should be configured on a victim host. Then an attacker can ping an external host from inside a masqueraded zone, so that the malicious ping is masqueraded and forwarded by a victim host. This is not default but (we believe) not rare configuration, so for example, a VM hosting provider could be vulnerable.
