The irda subsystem has been removed from the upstream kernel starting in but it is present in many distro kernels and the stable kernel tree.  Memory leak in the irda_bind function in net/irda/af_irda.c and later in drivers/staging/irda/net/af_irda.c in the Linux kernel before allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by repeatedly binding an AF_IRDA socket.  The irda_setsockopt function in net/irda/af_irda.c and later in drivers/staging/irda/net/af_irda.c in the Linux kernel before allows local users to cause a denial of service (ias_object use-after-free and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via an AF_IRDA socket.  I've sent the fixes to the stable kernel list but I don't yet see my submissions in the list archive on Spinics. Here are the equivalent versions of the patches against the Ubuntu kernel:  (>=  (<  Tyler     Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
