More at: https://www.squashtest.org/en  Description ----------- There is a vulnerability in SquashTM's administration panel, where external services (a.k.a. automation servers) are defined: each service's HTML page contains the cleartext password of the service's account. These external services could be anything but a popular example is a Jenkins server.  I believe there is no reason that a service should display the password of another service, as this gives an attacker the opportunity to spread laterally. If *anything*, the password should be hashed but then again I fail to see any reason this information should be provided at all in this context. This is somewhat even more exploitable given the fact that Squash's default credentials are admin:admin.  Details ------- Here's an example URL: Here's an extract of the page's source code:       <label for="ta-server-password">Password</label>       <div id="ta-server-password" class="display-table-cell" style="font-weight: bold;">cleartext_password</div>  Scoring ------- Attack vector: network Attack complexity: low  Authentication required: yes (admin) Impacts: confidentiality CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N  Timeline -------- Vulnerability reported as a private security bug: ACK required from editor Disclosure to oss-sec   Unsure if I should request a CVE for this? Seems kinda trivial.  Guillaume Quéré  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
