Severity: Important  Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation  Versions Affected: Apache Mesos to The unsupported Apache Mesos releases may be also affected.  Description: When parsing a malformed JSON payload, libprocess might crash due to an uncaught exception. Parsing chunked HTTP requests with trailers can lead to a libprocess crash too because of the mistakenly planted assertion. A malicious actor can therefore cause a denial of service of Mesos masters rendering the Mesos-controlled cluster inoperable.  Mitigation: pre-1.4.x users should upgrade to at least 1.4.x users should upgrade to users should upgrade to users should obtain Mesos or later  Credit: This issue was discovered by Lyon Yang (@l0Op3r), Jeremy Heng (@nn\_amon) and Quan Yang (@quanyang).
