You already did that, and people are free to share their experience (if on-topic for this list).  You also shared your experience (which happens to be only partially on-topic for this list).  As a moderator, I think that's enough contribution from you to this thread.  > and while I would agree that this subject matter is > not particularly on-topic for the list, I would think that there > effectively are not unmoderated lists, no place to really ask this > question in a substantial manner despite the importance of it, and of > crowd-sourcing other peoples experiences would be concerning to an > industry as a whole.  While I also regret that there's no longer an unmoderated full-disclosure list, I understand why there is not.  Besides needing to filter out all the automated spam (which already makes the list technically moderated), all sorts of semi-on-topic crap ends up being posted to truly unmoderated lists like that - personal attacks, doxing (and when you ask for removal of that content from archives later, you sort of engage in moderation too), conspiracy theories and dubious facts (and good luck figuring out what's real and what's not), etc.  That said, you may host a new list like that, and I'd be happy to be able to redirect discussions that are unsuitable in here to there.
