Description: Apache Ignite serialization mechanism does not have a list of classes allowed for serialization/deserialization, which makes it possible to run arbitrary code when 3-rd party vulnerable classes are present in Ignite classpath. The vulnerability can be exploited if the one sends a specially prepared form of a serialized object to GridClientJdkMarshaller deserialization endpoint.   Mitigation: All GridGain versions: make sure there are no vulnerable classes among your custom code used in GridGain.  Ignite Professional Edition or earlier users: upgrade to Ignite or later version Ignite Ultimate and Enterprise Editions or earlier users: upgrade to Ignite or later version After version upgrade use IGNITE_MARSHALLER_WHITELIST and/or IGNITE_MARSHALLER_BLACKLIST system properties to define classes allowed for deserialization. Refer to documentation for more details:  https://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/securing-data-deserialization <https://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/securing-data-deserialization> Credit: The vulnerability was discovered by Man Yue Mo of lgtm.com Reference:  Apache Ignite impacted by security vulnerability in Spring Data Commons Severity: Important Vendor: GridGain Systems Versions Affected: GridGain Professional Edition or earlier GridGain Ultimate and Enterprise Editions or earlier  Impact: 	An unauthenticated remote malicious user (or attacker) can issue requests against Spring Data REST or Spring Data   Description: 	Apache Ignite utilizes Spring Data Common library for some of its components. The vulnerability affects Apache Ignite users who us Spring Data REST for access an Ignite cluster via HTTP and Spring Data. Spring Data Commons, versions prior to to 2.0 to and older unsupported versions, contain a property binder vulnerability caused by improper neutralization of special elements. An unauthenticated remote malicious user (or attacker) can supply specially crafted request parameters against  	Spring Data REST backed HTTP resources or using Spring Data’s projection-based request payload binding hat can lead to a remote code execution attack.  Mitigation: Ignite Professional Edition or earlier users: upgrade to Ignite or later version Ignite Ultimate and Enterprise Editions or earlier users: upgrade to Ignite or later version Credit: Harendra Rai of NCR Corporation discovered the impact of the existing vulnerability on Apache Ignite.
