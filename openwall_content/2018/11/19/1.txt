The fuzzer did not check that the precondition is satisfied. If XMLDocument::Parse is called in the one-argument-form (or with a (size_t)-1 argument), then it uses strlen on the input string, which must be null-terminated. This is clearly spelled out in the API documentation.   This is just a courtesy notice in case you want to update your records before MITRE processes the rejection request (or rejects it altogether).
