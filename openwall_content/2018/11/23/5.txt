Under certain conditions it may not drop a content of a deleted file on its last iput(). When a newly created file gets an inode number of the previously deleted file its read can get the content of the deleted file saved in cleancache.  For now only Xen's tmem driver registers itself as a backend for cleancache:  $ git grep cleancache_register_ops ... drivers/xen/tmem.c:             err = cleancache_register_ops(&tmem_cleancache_ops); mm/cleancache.c:int cleancache_register_ops(const struct cleancache_ops *ops)  This means only Xen's guests with tmem driver active are vulnerable.
