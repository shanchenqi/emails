I think that's not what Marcus meant.  These packages on debian likely call bc via the commandline.  The idea here is that "mild" memory safety violations (invalid reads, nullptr) don't get security treatment if they're in a standalone tool, yet they do if they're in a library, which may have larger implications in more complex apps. I can somewhat understand that. (And decided for myself not to care too much about CVEs anyway. Relevant for me is primarily that I shared the info, so others can decide how they act on it.)  --  Hanno Bรถck https://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
