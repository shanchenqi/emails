It could occur in routines wherein 'len' parameter is a  'signed int' which subsequently converts to an unsigned integer resulting in  memcpy() copying large amounts of memory.  A user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process resulting in  DoS.  Upstream patch: ---------------    ->  This issue was reported by Arash TC  Thank you. -- Prasad J Pandit / Red Hat Product Security Team 47AF CE69 54AA DD13 FE5B  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
