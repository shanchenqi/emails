Sure, i understand how memory errors in libraries offer a much larger "attack surface" than errors in code called across a process boundary.  However, i am used to looking at a lot of code that calls across process boundaries (hello, GnuPG!) and i can tell you that there's a lot of software out there that doesn't cope well with (or, maybe worse, doesn't even notice) surprising terminations, surprising output on certain file descriptors, or surprising return codes.  sounds like two of your 5 examples have at least surprising terminations and return codes.  These oversights can lead to other failures or problems that we don't expect, so i'm reluctant to encourage people to ignore them, though i grant that these failures with full memory access is even worse :)           --dkg  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
