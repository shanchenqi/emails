In Linux kernel versions since map_write() in kernel/user_namespace.c handles nested user namespaces with more than 5 UID or GID ranges incorrectly. This can allow a user who has CAP_SYS_ADMIN in a user namespace which maps at least 6 UIDs or GIDs to bypass access controls on resources outside the namespace.
