I have requested and received CVEs from Mitre for those.  Ciao, Marcus  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash:  The 4 CVE IDs are below.  We would not ordinarily have CVE IDs for these types of crash issues. However, says "because dcraw intentionally doesn't provide a library, only an executable, code from it is bundled in at least some applications."  For example, an FPE (such as a divide-by-zero) in the dcraw executable isn't a security issue because it is only a way for the local user to attack himself. However, it is plausible that someone has bundled the dcraw code in an application that is supposed to continue running forever to accept a continuous series of raw images from a camera over Wi-Fi.  In "kodac_radc_load_raw" has a typo in the fifth letter.   > [Suggested description] > A buffer over-read in crop_masked_pixels in dcraw through could be > used by attackers able to supply malicious files to crash an application that bundles the dcraw code or leak > private information. >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Additional Information] > issue 1 listed >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [VulnerabilityType Other] > >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Vendor of Product] > Dave Coffin >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Affected Product Code Base] > dcraw - >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Affected Component] > dcraw >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Attack Type] > Local >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Impact Information Disclosure] > true >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [CVE Impact Other] > crash >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Attack Vectors] > processing raw files >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Reference] > > >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Discoverer] > Hanno Boeck  Use   > [Suggested description] > A heap buffer over-read in parse_tiff_ifd in dcraw through could be > used by attackers able to supply malicious files to crash an application that bundles the dcraw code or leak > private information. >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Additional Information] > second issue in posting >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Vulnerability Type] > Buffer Overflow >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Vendor of Product] > Dave Coffin >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Affected Product Code Base] > dcraw - >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Affected Component] > dcraw >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Attack Type] > Local >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Impact Information Disclosure] > true >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [CVE Impact Other] > crash >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Attack Vectors] > processing supplied raw files >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Reference] > > >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Discoverer] > Hanno Boeck  Use   > [Suggested description] > A floating point exception in parse_tiff_ifd in dcraw through could > be used by attackers able to supply malicious files to crash an application that bundles the dcraw code. >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Additional Information] > fourth issue in list >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [VulnerabilityType Other] > crash >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Vendor of Product] > Dave Coffin >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Affected Product Code Base] > dcraw - >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Affected Component] > dcraw >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Attack Type] > Local >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Impact Denial of Service] > true >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Attack Vectors] > attackers able to supply crafted files >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Reference] > > >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Discoverer] > Hanno Boeck  Use   > [Suggested description] > A floating point exception in kodak_radc_load_raw in dcraw through > could be used by attackers able to supply malicious files to crash > an application that bundles the dcraw code. >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Additional Information] > last issue in post >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [VulnerabilityType Other] > crash >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Vendor of Product] > Dave Coffin >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Affected Product Code Base] > dcraw - >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Affected Component] > dcraw >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Attack Type] > Local >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Impact Denial of Service] > true >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Attack Vectors] > attackers able to supply crafted raw images >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Reference] > > >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Discoverer] > Hanno Boeck  Use   - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =AUEp -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
