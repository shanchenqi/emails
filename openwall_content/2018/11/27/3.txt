This error condition can be triggered via the getaddrinfo function (and at least one HTTP client library).     Fixed with this upstream commit:  commit Author: Florian Weimer <fweimer@...hat.com> Date:   Tue Nov 27      if_nametoindex: Fix descriptor for overlong name [BZ  The vulnerability was introduced in commit ("Check length of ifname before copying it into to ifreq structure."), fixing bug for glibc Since this addressed a compiler warning with GCC 8, this commit was backported to quite a few release branches.
