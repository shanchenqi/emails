This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier  Versions Affected: >= Not affected: < Fixed Versions:  Impact ------ Carefully crafted user input can cause Active Job to deserialize it using GlobalId and allow an attacker to have access to information that they should not have.  Vulnerable code will look something like this:      MyJob.perform_later(user_input)  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.  Releases -------- The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds ----------- Putting the following monkey patch in an intializer can help to mitigate the issue:  ``` require 'active_job' require 'active_job/arguments'  module ArgumentsNotDeserializingGlobalId   def deserialize_argument(argument)     case argument     when String       argument     else       super     end   end end  ActiveJob::Arguments.singleton_class.prepend(ArgumentsNotDeserializingGlobalId) ```  Patches ------- To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.  * 4-2-activejob-direct-access.patch - Patch for 4.2 series * 5-0-activejob-direct-access.patch - Patch for 5.0 series * 5-1-activejob-direct-access.patch - Patch for 5.1 series * 5-2-activejob-direct-access.patch - Patch for 5.2 series  Please note that only the 5.x and 4.2.x series are supported at present. Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.
