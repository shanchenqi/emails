It describes a potential hang when using instructions with the XACQUIRE prefix on the host physical memory range covering the first 4 MiB starting at the 1GiB boundary.  IMPACT ======  A malicious or buggy guest may cause a CPU to hang, resulting in a DoS (Denial of Service) affecting the entire host.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen versions are affected.  Only Intel based x86 systems are affected.  Please refer to Intel documentation as to which specific CPU models are affected.  AMD x86 systems as well as Arm ones are not affected.  MITIGATION ==========  There is no known mitigation.  A BIOS update may be available for some systems, working around the issue at the firmware level.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate pair of attached patches works around this issue for the CPU models known to be affected at the time of writing.                               xen-unstable +        Xen Xen +         Xen 4.9.x +     Xen 4.8.x, Xen 4.7.x  $       $  NOTE REGARDING LACK OF EMBARGO ==============================  The issue has been documented publicly in Specification Updates for at least some of the affected processors for quite some time. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----  =Ipfd -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
