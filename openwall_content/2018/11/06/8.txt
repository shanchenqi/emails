Best regards,  Remi Gacogne PowerDNS.COM BV - https://www.powerdns.com/  PowerDNS Security Advisory Crafted zone record can cause a denial of service =====================================================================================  -  CVE: -  Date: November 6th -  Affects: PowerDNS Authoritative from up to and including -  Not affected: -  Severity: Medium -  Impact: Denial of service -  Exploit: This problem can be triggered via crafted records -  Risk of system compromise: No -  Solution: Upgrade to a non-affected version -  Workaround: run the process inside the guardian or inside a    supervisor  An issue has been found in PowerDNS Authoritative Server allowing an authorized user to cause a memory leak by inserting a specially crafted record in a zone under their control, then sending a DNS query for that record. The issue is due to the fact that some memory is allocated before the parsing and is not always properly released if the record is malformed.  This issue has been assigned  When the PowerDNS Authoritative Server is run inside the guardian (``--guardian``), or inside a supervisor like supervisord or systemd, an out-of-memory crash will lead to an automatic restart, limiting the impact to a somewhat degraded service.  PowerDNS Authoritative from up to and including is affected. Please note that at the time of writing, PowerDNS Authoritative 3.4 and below are no longer supported, as described in https://doc.powerdns.com/authoritative/appendices/EOL.html.  PowerDNS Security Advisory Crafted answer can cause a denial of service ================================================================================  -  CVE: -  Date: November 6th -  Affects: PowerDNS Recursor from 3.2 up to and including -  Not affected: -  Severity: Medium -  Impact: Denial of service -  Exploit: This problem can be triggered by an authoritative server -  Risk of system compromise: No -  Solution: Upgrade to a non-affected version -  Workaround: run the process inside a supervisor  An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor allowing a malicious authoritative server to cause a memory leak by sending specially crafted records. The issue is due to the fact that some memory is allocated before the parsing and is not always properly released if the record is malformed.  This issue has been assigned  When the PowerDNS Recursor is run inside a supervisor like supervisord or systemd, an out-of-memory crash will lead to an automatic restart, limiting the impact to a somewhat degraded service.  PowerDNS Recursor from 3.2 up to and including is affected. Please note that at the time of writing, PowerDNS Recursor 3.7 and below are no longer supported, as described in https://doc.powerdns.com/recursor/appendices/EOL.html.  PowerDNS Security Advisory Packet cache pollution via crafted query ============================================================================  -  CVE: -  Date: November 6th -  Affects: PowerDNS Authoritative from up to and including -  Not affected: 4.0.x -  Severity: Medium -  Impact: Denial of service -  Exploit: This problem can be triggered via crafted queries -  Risk of system compromise: No -  Solution: Upgrade to a non-affected version  An issue has been found in PowerDNS Authoritative Server allowing a remote user to craft a DNS query that will cause an answer without DNSSEC records to be inserted into the packet cache and be returned to clients asking for DNSSEC records, thus hiding the presence of DNSSEC signatures for a specific qname and qtype. For a DNSSEC-signed domain, this means that DNSSEC validating clients will consider the answer to be bogus until it expires from the packet cache, leading to a denial of service.  This issue has been assigned  PowerDNS Authoritative from up to and including is affected.  We would like to thank Kees Monshouwer for finding and subsequently reporting this issue.  PowerDNS Security Advisory Packet cache pollution via crafted query ============================================================================  -  CVE: -  Date: November 6th -  Affects: PowerDNS Recursor from up to and including -  Not affected: -  Severity: Medium -  Impact: Denial of service -  Exploit: This problem can be triggered via crafted queries -  Risk of system compromise: No -  Solution: Upgrade to a non-affected version  An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor allowing a remote user to craft a DNS query that will cause an answer without DNSSEC records to be inserted into the packet cache and be returned to clients asking for DNSSEC records, thus hiding the presence of DNSSEC signatures for a specific qname and qtype. For a DNSSEC-signed domain, this means that clients performing DNSSEC validation by themselves might consider the answer to be bogus until it expires from the packet cache, leading to a denial of service.  This issue has been assigned  PowerDNS Recursor from up to and including is affected.  We would like to thank Kees Monshouwer for finding and subsequently reporting this issue.  PowerDNS Security Advisory Crafted query for meta-types can cause a denial of service ==============================================================================================  -  CVE: -  Date: November 6th -  Affects: PowerDNS Recursor from up to and including -  Not affected: -  Severity: Medium -  Impact: Denial of service -  Exploit: This problem can be triggered via crafted queries for some domains -  Risk of system compromise: No -  Solution: Upgrade to a non-affected version  An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor where a remote attacker sending a DNS query for a meta-type like OPT can lead to a zone being wrongly cached as failing DNSSEC validation. It only arises if the parent zone is signed, and all the authoritative servers for that parent zone answer with FORMERR to a query for at least one of the meta-types. As a result, subsequent queries from clients requesting DNSSEC validation will be answered with a ServFail.  This issue has been assigned by Red Hat.  PowerDNS Recursor from up to and including is affected.  We would like to thank Toshifumi Sakaguchi for finding and subsequently reporting this issue.
