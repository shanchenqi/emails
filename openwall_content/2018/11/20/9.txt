Cashdollar, @_larry0 Date: CWE: Arbitrary File Upload Download Site: N/A Vendor: FineUploader Vendor Notified: software discontinued.   Advisory:  Description: PHP-based server-side example for handling traditional endpoint requests from Fine Uploader  Vulnerability: The code in endpoint.php allows file uploads and doesn't check if the users authenticated or the file type.  This allows for executable files to be uploaded and therefore remote code execution.   Lines from endpoint.php:  37: // Specify the list of valid extensions, ex. array("jpeg", "xml", "bmp") 38: $uploader->allowedExtensions = array(); // all files types allowed by default  Exploit Code:    Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
