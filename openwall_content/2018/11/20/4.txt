ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The internal function querying a domain's p2m table grabs the p2m lock by default, so that the answer to the query remains true until the caller can act on that information; it is up to the caller then to release the lock.  Unfortunately, certain failure paths don't release the lock.  IMPACT ======  A malicious or buggy guest may cause a deadlock, resulting in a DoS (Denial of Service) affecting the entire host.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen and onward are vulnerable.  Only x86 systems are vulnerable.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.  Only systems running untrusted HVM or PVH guests are vulnerable. Systems running only PV guests are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only PV guests will avoid this vulnerability.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Paul Durrant of Citrix.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            xen-unstable, Xen  $   $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
