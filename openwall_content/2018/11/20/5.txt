ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Allocation of pages used to communicate with external emulators did not follow certain principles that are required for proper life cycle management of guest exposed pages.  IMPACT ======  A compromised DM stubdomain may cause Xen to crash, resulting in a DoS (Denial of Service) affecting the entire host.  Privilege escalation as well as information leaks cannot be ruled out.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Only Xen is affected by this vulnerability.  Xen and older are not affected by this vulnerability.  Only systems running HVM guests with their devicemodels in a stubdomain are considered vulnerable.  Note that attackers also need to exploit the devicemodel in order to have access to this vulnerability.  Arm guests cannot leverage this vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only PV guests will avoid this vulnerability.  (The security of a Xen system using stub domains is still better than with a qemu-dm running as an unrestricted dom0 process.  Therefore users with these configurations should not switch to an unrestricted dom0 qemu-dm.)  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Julien Grall of ARM.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate set of attached patches resolves this issue.            xen-unstable        Xen  $      $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
