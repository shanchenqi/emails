It could occur due to a race condition in  updating fid path in worker threads via v9fs_path_copy(), while accessing  files on a shared host directory.  A user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process resulting in  DoS issue.  Upstream patch: ---------------    ->    ->  This issue was reported by Zhibin hu.
