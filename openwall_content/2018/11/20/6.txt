ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The fix for introduced a new field into the control structure associated with each page of RAM.  This field was added to a union, another member of which is used when Xen uses shadow paging for the guest.  During migration, or with the L1TF mitigation for PV guests in effect, the two uses conflict.  IMPACT ======  A malicious or buggy x86 PV guest may cause Xen to crash, resulting in a DoS (Denial of Service) affecting the entire host.  Privilege escalation as well as information leaks cannot be ruled out.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen versions from at least 3.2 onwards are vulnerable.  Earlier versions have not been checked.  Only x86 systems are affected.  ARM systems are not affected.  Only Xen versions with the fixes applied are vulnerable.  Only Xen versions which permit linear page table use by PV guests are vulnerable.  Only x86 PV guests can leverage this vulnerability.  x86 HVM guests cannot leverage this vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  Not permitting linear page table use by PV guests avoids the vulnerability.  This can be done both at build time, by turning off the PV_LINEAR_PT configure option, or at runtime, by passing specifying "pv-linear-pt=0" on the hypervisor command line.  On systems where the guest kernel is controlled by the host rather than guest administrator, running only kernels which have themselves been hardened against L1TF _and_ avoiding live migrating or snapshotting PV guests will generally prevent this issue being triggered.  However untrusted guest administrators can still trigger it unless further steps are taken to prevent them from loading code into the kernel (e.g. by disabling loadable modules etc) or from using other mechanisms which allow them to run code at kernel privilege.  Running only HVM guests will avoid this vulnerability.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by the security team of Prgmr.com.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate pair of attached patches resolves this issue.                                 xen-unstable +          Xen +          Xen +      Xen 4.9.x, Xen 4.8.x +       Xen 4.7.x  $        $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) EXCEPT the linear page table disabling one is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  However deployment of the linear page table disabling mitigation is NOT PERMITTED (except where all the affected systems and VMs are administered and used only by organisations which are members of the Xen Project Security Issues Predisclosure List).  Specifically, deployment on public cloud systems is NOT permitted.  This is because altering the set of features usable in a guest in connection with a security issue would be a user-visible change which could lead to the rediscovery of the vulnerability.  Also: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
