For example, an out-of-bounds write finding is still very useful in that case, but not out-of-bounds read, NULL pointer dereference, divide-by-zero, etc.   Reference:  On Sat, Nov 10, at PM Dhiraj Mishra <mishra.dhiraj95@...il.com> wrote:  > ## Summary > > While fuzzing evince on linux (Ubuntu > LTS), a null-pointer dereference was observed, initially this was reported > to evince but the evince team advised that the issue is in poppler, the > library used by evince to render PDF.
