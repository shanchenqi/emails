One such > application : RawTherapee  GraphicsMagick also bundles some version of dcraw for its Microsoft  Windows builds.  It is executed as an external program so if it  becomes corrupted, it will not corrupt the invoking application.  Another consideration is that the dcraw author has huge sample image  archive that he is only willing to sell for private use.  This means  that other projects (including those which derived code from dcraw)  might not work correctly with as many input files since they have not  done as much validation.
