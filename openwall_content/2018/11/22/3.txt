Impact would be mostly relevant if someone has some imap functionality where a user can define a custom imap server. (Though it might also be used as a bypass for environments where exec() and similar functions are restricted.)  I reported it to upstream PHP a few days ago, it was closed as a duplicate, so it seems they already knew about it. It's unfixed in current versions.  There seems to be some speculation that this might've been involved in a hack of a .onion hoster:   --  Hanno Bรถck https://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
