If the impacted files belong to another already localized, public archive on the node then code can be injected into the jobs of other cluster users using the public archive.  Mitigation: Users should upgrade to Apache Hadoop or  Credit: This issue was discovered by Snyk Security Research Team https://snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
