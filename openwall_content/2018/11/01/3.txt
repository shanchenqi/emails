Rücker <thomas@...cker.fi> To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: Icecast - - buffer overflow in url-auth  We released a new version of Icecast. It is a security release and we recommend to update all Icecast installations of versions below to it.  -   Fix buffer overflows in URL auth code,     * This security issue affects all Icecast servers running version       or if there is a "mount" definition       that enables URL authentication.     * A malicious client could send long HTTP headers, leading to       a buffer overflow and potential remote code execution.     * The problematic code was introduced in version and       was now brought to our attention by Nick Rolfe of       Semmle Security Research Team https://lgtm.com/security   -   Worked around buffer overflows in URL auth's cURL interface.     * We currently do not believe that this issue is exploitable.       It would require a malicious URL authentication back end server       to send a crafted payload and make it through libcURL.     * If someone manages, please let us know.   Source:    Thomas B.
