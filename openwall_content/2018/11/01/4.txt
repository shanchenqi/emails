The nature of the leakage is due to execution engine sharing on SMT (e.g. Hyper-Threading) architectures. More specifically, we detect port contention to construct a timing side channel to exfiltrate information from processes running in parallel on the same physical core. Report is below.  Thanks for reading!  BBB  # Report  We steal an OpenSSL (<= private key from a TLS server using this new side-channel vector. It is a local attack in the sense that the malicious process must be running on the same physical core as the victim (an OpenSSL-powered TLS server in this case).  ## Affected hardware  SMT/Hyper-Threading architectures (verified on Skylake and Kaby Lake)  ## Affected software  OpenSSL <= (but in general, software that has secret dependent control flow at any granularity; this particular application is a known vulnerability since only recently fixed)  Ubuntu (again, it is really a hardware issue, but anyway this distro is where we ran our experiments)  ## Classification and rating  Tracked by  CWE wise, I would label it like  Information Exposure Through Timing Discrepancy  At a very high level (e.g. CVSS string), it is similar to this CVE:   But the underlying uarch component is totally different. Our attack has nothing to do with the memory subsystem or caching, and that CVE is specifically for data caching (e.g. some fixes for do not address this new attack vector at all).  ## Disclosure timeline  01 Oct Notified Intel Security 26 Oct Notified openssl-security 26 Oct Notified CERT-FI 26 Oct Notified oss-security distros list 01 Nov Embargo expired  ## Fix  Disable SMT/Hyper-Threading in the bios  Upgrade to OpenSSL (or >= if you are looking for patches)  ## Credit  Billy Bob Brumley, Cesar Pereida Garcia, Sohaib ul Hassan, Nicola Tuveri (Tampere University of Technology, Finland) Alejandro Cabrera Aldaya (Universidad Tecnologica de la Habana CUJAE, Cuba)  ## Refs   ## Exploit  Attached exploit code (password "infected") should work out of the box for Skylake and Kaby Lake.
