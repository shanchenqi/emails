Mitigation: It is recommended to upgrade to or or later if HiveServer2 is used, and ranger, sentry or sql standard authorizer is not in use. Admin needs to specify the following entries in hiveserver2-site.xml:  <property>   <name>hive.security.authorization.enabled</name>   <value>true</value> </property> <property>   <name>hive.security.authorization.manager</name>   <value>org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.security.authorization.plugin.fallback.FallbackHiveAuthorizerFactory</value> </property>  FallbackHiveAuthorizerFactory will do the following to mitigate above mentioned threat: 1. Disallow local file location in sql statements except for admin 2. Allow "set" only selected whitelist parameters 3. Disallow dfs commands except for admin 4. Disallow "ADD JAR" statement 5. Disallow "COMPILE" statement 6. Disallow "TRANSFORM" statement  Credit: This issue was discovered by Mithun Radhakrishnan of Oath Inc  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
