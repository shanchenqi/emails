It could occur in nvme_cmb_ops routines in nvme devices. A  guest user/process could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process resulting in  DoS or potentially run arbitrary code with privileges of the QEMU process.  Upstream patch: ---------------    ->  This issue was found and reported by Li Qiang. assigned by  Red Hat Inc.
