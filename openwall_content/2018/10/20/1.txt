Huh, wow! I would also have had the gut-feeling of 2^(n-1) and had to code a little program to verify the facts:  import hashlib ps = [ ] for q in 	for p in 		z = q | (p << 32) 		z = int.to_bytes(z, length = 8, byteorder = "little") 		if hashlib.md5(z).digest()[0] == 0: 			break 	ps.append(p) print(sum(ps) / len(ps))  And indeed, you're absolutely correct. Thanks for the comment!  Have a great weekend, Joe  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
