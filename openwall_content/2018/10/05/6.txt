Since you say that "leveraging root access to execute crafted applications" is required, how is this a security issue?  Also, since this setup has to be prepared locally, how is the attack "remote"?  In other words, would a sysadmin plausibly make this kind of custom local setup, and why?  If the answer is no, then I think there's no security issue here.
