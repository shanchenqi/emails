I'm not sure if dolphin uses them as well.  It seems to be a bug that this directory is under /usr/share, and not under /etc where admins could modify it to selectively disable things.  I checked and there is no parallel /etc/thumbnailers directory to drop overriding entries into - though maybe ~/.local/share/thumbnailers would work?  But already the fact that I have to guess is a bug :-(  By the way, on fedora the /usr/share/thumbnailers entry indeed does belong to the evince package, but there is a separate evince-nautilus package and its description says:  : This package contains the evince extension for the nautilus file manager. : It adds an additional tab called "Document" to the file properties dialog.  Do you think that removing evince-nautilus would eliminate the nautilus attack vector at least?  --  Please don't Cc: me privately on mailing lists and Usenet, if you also post the followup to the list or newsgroup.
