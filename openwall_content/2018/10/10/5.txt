I don't know what exactly Tavis was referring to, but a scenario that has been discussed in the past and likely is still possible in many configurations is this: Some browsers (notably chrome) will download files without asking in their default configuration. So a site can make you download a file and it ends up in your ~/Downloads dir.  Desktop search tools will automatically index that (tracker from gnome, baloo from kde). So voila - you can fire up an exploit if you can exploit anything that tracker or baloo support.   Though I'm not sure if either of them uses ghostscript, a quick check it seems that not. You still have the automatic download issue in chrome, but you'd need to convince your user to open up ~/Downloads in a file manager. That's a minor not-fully-automatic part, but I guess it's plausible enough that users will eventually do that at some point.  --  Hanno Bรถck https://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
