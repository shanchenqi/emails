While the vulnerability in ghostscript itself is clear in this thread,  does anyone have any more info on the above aspect of this? i.e is the  above scenario (inadvertently running postscript, perhaps contained in  an image, through ghostscript by just browsing a malicious site) limited  to just nautilus in gnome environments? Do other browsers/environments  handle this better or do they do similar? It seems that, strictly  speaking, the "critical" nature of this vulnerability hinges on the  behaviour of the browser/desktop environment. Otherwise the scope is  limited to an individual manually downloading a postscript file and  opening it outside of the browser.  Apologies if I'm missing anything obvious or if this has been covered  elsewhere online.
