The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * Jenkins weekly * Jenkins LTS  Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  A path traversal vulnerability in Stapler allowed viewing routable objects  with views defined on any type. This could be used to access internal data  of routable objects, e.g. by showing their string representation (#toString).   Users with Job/Configure permission could specify a relative path escaping  the base directory in the file name portion of a file parameter definition.  This path would be used to archive the uploaded file on the Jenkins master,  resulting in an arbitrary file write vulnerability.  File parameters that escape the base directory are no longer accepted and  the build will fail.   The wrapper query parameter for the XML variant of the Jenkins remote API  did not validate the specified tag name. This resulted in a reflected cross- site scripting vulnerability.  Only legal XML tag names are now allowed for the wrapper query parameter.   / When attempting to authenticate using API token, an ephemeral user record  was created to validate the token in case an external security realm was  used, and the user record in Jenkins not previously saved, as (legacy) API  tokens could exist without a persisted user record.  This behavior could be abused to create a large number of ephemeral user  records in memory.  This is the same vulnerability as The fix for  was previously incorrectly applied and therefore not effective. This has  been fixed.   By accessing a specific crafted URL on Jenkins instances using Jenkins' own  user database, users without Overall/Read access could create ephemeral  user records.  This behavior could be abused to create a large number of ephemeral user  records in memory.  Accessing this URL now no longer results in a user record getting created.   When signing up for a new user account on instances using Jenkins' own user  database, Jenkins did not invalidate the existing session and create a new  one. This allowed session fixation.  Jenkins now invalidates the existing session and creates a new one when  logging in after user signup.   When Jenkins fails to process form submissions due to an internal error,  the error message shown to the user and written to the log typically  includes the serialized JSON form submission. Secrets, such as submitted  passwords, might be included with the JSON object, and shown or written to  disk in plain text.  Jenkins now masks values in these error messages from view if they were  shown on the UI as password form fields.
