A buffer  overflow in the handling of Type 1 fonts (.pfb files) allows arbitrary  local code execution without privilege escalation when a malicious font  is loaded by one of the vulnerable tools (pdflatex, pdftex, luatex, dvips).       The patch was rolled out on Sept 21.  See:   Thanks, -- Nick  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
