Here they are:  VULN#1 =====================  First bug is remotely exploitable without knowledge of the community string, and leads to Denial of Service:    # echo -n | base64 -d >    # -f -d -V -c ../../snmpd.conf -Ln    ASAN:SIGSEGV   =================================================================   AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address (pc bp sp T0)       #0 in snmp_oid_compare       #1 in _snmp_parse       #2 in snmp_parse       #3 in _sess_process_packet       #4 in _sess_read       #5 in snmp_sess_read2       #6 in snmp_read2       #7 in receive       #8 in main       #9 in __libc_start_main       #10 in _start    AddressSanitizer can not provide additional info.
