Oh, sorry, maybe I didn't explain it.  This is the same as what ah_add does. The only difference is that ah_add makes the encryption length 0. This makes it easier for me to write POC. In reality, the longer the encryption length, the more the denial of service will be.In other words, under the real production environment, the ipsec denial service effect will be more obvious.
