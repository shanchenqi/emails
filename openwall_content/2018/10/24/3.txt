This may pose a potential security risk, such as having ALTER on a table and ALL on a particular database allows a user to move the table to a database with ALL, which will automatically grant that user with ALL privilege on that table due to the privilege inherited from the database   On Wed, Oct 24, at PM Jim Apple <jbapple@...udera.com> wrote:  > The Apache Impala PMC is announcing the release of Impala > > Impala is a high-performance distributed SQL engine. > > The release is available at https://impala.apache.org/downloads.html > > Thanks, > Jim Apple on behalf of the Apache Impala PMC > >   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
