As a result, a guest can blindly execute the virtualisation instructions, and will exit to Xen for processing.  In the case that the guest hasn't followed the correct (virtual) configuration procedure, it shouldn't be able to use the instructions, and Xen should respond with #UD exception.  When nested virtualisation is disabled for the guest, it is not permitted to complete the configuration procedure.  Unfortunately, when nested virtualisation is intended to be disabled for the guest, an incorrect default value leads Xen to believe that the configuration procedure has already been completed.  IMPACT ======  Guest software which blindly plays with the VT-x instructions can cause Xen to operate on uninitialised data.  As the backing memory is zeroed, this causes Xen to suffer a NULL pointer dereference, causing a host Denial of Service.  Other behaviours such as memory corruption or privilege escalation have not been ruled out.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Systems running Xen 4.9 or later are vulnerable.  Systems running Xen 4.8 or earlier are not vulnerable.  Only Intel x86 systems are vulnerable.  Systems from other x86 vendors, and other hardware vendors are not vulnerable.  Only x86 HVM and PVH guests can leverage this vulnerability.  x86 PV guests cannot leverage this vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only x86 PV guests will avoid the issue.  For x86 HVM guests, while enabling nested virtualisation for affected guests does work around this particular DoS, it is not a security supported configuration and has other know DoS and suspected privilege escalation vulnerabilities.  Therefore, it is not a mitigation.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Sergey Dyasli of Citrix.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            xen-unstable      Xen 4.9  $   $  NOTE CONCERNING LACK OF EMBARGO ===============================  This issue was first reported in private and was in the usual XSA process.  It was later independently reported in public with enough detail for the issue to be considered fully public. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----  =fPmO -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
