This server will accept connections from external hosts by default. A specially-crafted request to the zinc server could cause it to reveal information in files readable to the developer account running the build. Note that this issue does not affect end users of Spark, only developers building Spark from source code.  Mitigation: Spark users are not affected, as zinc is only a part of the build process. Spark developers may simply use a local Maven installation's 'mvn' command to build, and avoid running build/mvn and zinc. Spark developers building actively-developed branches (2.2.x, 2.3.x, 2.4.x, master) may update their branches to receive mitigations already patched onto the build/mvn script. Spark developers running zinc separately may include "-server in its command line, and consider additional flags like "-idle-timeout 30m" to achieve similar mitigation.
