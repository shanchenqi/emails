If only a sub-set of the URLs supported by Tomcat were exposed via httpd, then it was possible for a specially constructed request to expose application functionality through the reverse proxy that was not intended for clients accessing the application via the reverse proxy. It was also possible in some configurations for a specially constructed request to bypass the access controls configured in httpd. While there is some overlap between this issue and they are not identical.  Mitigation: Users of affected versions should apply one of the following mitigations: - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat JK ISAPI Connector or later. - Use alternative measures (e.g. the remote address filter) to restrict   access to trusted users.  Credit: This issue was first discovered by Alphan YAVAS from Biznet Bilisim A.S. and reported responsibly to the Apache Tomcat Security Team. Additional attack vectors were identified by RaphaĂŤl Arrouas (Xel) and Jean Lejeune (Nitrax) from immunIT.
