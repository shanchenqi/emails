All of the following bugs were reported by Michael Hanselmann (hansmi.ch).   ============== It was found that the fix for  and was incomplete. A remote, authenticated  attacker could use one of these flaws to execute arbitrary code, create  arbitrary files, or cause denial of service on glusterfs server nodes via  symlinks to relative paths.   ============== A buffer overflow was found in strncpy of the pl_getxattr() function. An  authenticated attacker could remotely overflow the buffer by sending a buffer  of larger length than the size of the key resulting in remote denial of  service.   ============== A buffer overflow on the heap was found in gf_getspec_req RPC request. A  remote, authenticated attacker could use this flaw to cause denial of service  and read arbitrary files on glusterfs server node.    ============== A flaw was found in the way glusterfs server handles client requests. A  remote, authenticated attacker could set arbitrary values for the  GF_XATTROP_ENTRY_IN_KEY and GF_XATTROP_ENTRY_OUT_KEY during xattrop file  operation resulting in creation and deletion of arbitrary files on glusterfs  server node.   ============== A flaw was found in glusterfs server which allowed clients to create io-stats  dumps on server node. A remote, authenticated attacker could use this flaw to  create io-stats dump on a server without any limitation and utilizing all  available inodes resulting in remote denial of service.    ============== A flaw was found in glusterfs server which allowed repeated usage of  GF_META_LOCK_KEY xattr. A remote, authenticated attacker could use this flaw  to create multiple locks for single inode by using setxattr repetitively  resulting in memory exhaustion of glusterfs server node.   ============== It was found that usage of snprintf function in feature/locks translator of  glusterfs server was vulnerable to a format string attack. A remote,  authenticated attacker could use this flaw to cause remote denial of service.
