The internal function `Curl_auth_create_plain_message` fails to correctly verify that the passed in lengths for name and password aren't too long, then calculates a buffer size to allocate.  On systems with a 32 bit `size_t`, the math to calculate the buffer size triggers an integer overflow when the user name length exceeds 2GB bytes). This integer overflow usually causes a very small buffer to actually get allocated instead of the intended very huge one, making the use of that buffer end up in a heap buffer overflow.  (This bug is very similar to  We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.  INFO ----  The affected function can only be invoked when using POP3(S), IMAP(S) or SMTP(S).  This bug was introduced in [commit August  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name to this issue.  Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size  Severity: 3.2 (Low)  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  This issue is only present on 32 bit systems. It also requires the username field to use more than 2GB of memory, which should be rare.  - Affected versions: libcurl to and including - Not affected versions: libcurl < and >=  curl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such.  THE SOLUTION ------------  In libcurl version the integer overflow is avoided. An error will be returned if a too long user name is attempted.  A [patch for is available.  RECOMMENDATIONS ---------------  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:    A - Upgrade curl to version    B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild    C - Put length restrictions on the username field you can pass to libcurl  TIME LINE ---------  It was reported to the curl project on September 6,  We contacted distros@...nwall on October 22.  curl was released on October 31 coordinated with the publication of this advisory.
