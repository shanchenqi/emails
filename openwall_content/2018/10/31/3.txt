The command line tool has a generic function for displaying warning and informational messages to stderr for various situations. For example if an unknown command line argument is used, or passed to it in a "config" file.  This display function formats the output to wrap at 80 columns. The wrap logic is however flawed, so if a single word in the message is itself longer than 80 bytes the buffer arithmetic calculates the remainder wrong and will end up reading behind the end of the buffer. This could lead to information disclosure or crash.  This vulnerability could lead to a security issue if used in this or similar situations:    1. a server somewhere uses the curl command line to run something   2. if it fails, it shows stderr to the user   3. the server takes user input for parts of its command line input   4. user provides something overly long that triggers this crash   5. the stderr output may now contain user memory contents that wasn't meant      to be available  We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.  INFO ----  This flaw exists in the command line tool only, not in libcurl.  This bug was introduced in [commit August  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name to this issue.  Out-of-bounds Read  Severity: 3.3 (Low)  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  - Affected versions: curl to and including - Not affected versions: curl < and >=  curl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such.  THE SOLUTION ------------  A [patch for  RECOMMENDATIONS ---------------  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:    A - Upgrade curl to version    B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild  TIME LINE ---------  It was reported to the curl project on October 27,  We contacted distros@...nwall on October 28.  curl was released on October 31 coordinated with the publication of this advisory.
