When closing and cleaning up an "easy" handle in the `Curl_close()` function, the library code first frees a struct (without nulling the pointer) and might then subsequently erroneously write to a struct field within that already freed struct.  We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.  INFO ----  This bug was introduced in [commit February  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name to this issue.  Use After Free  Severity: 2.3 (Low)  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  - Affected versions: libcurl to and including - Not affected versions: libcurl < and >=  curl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such.
