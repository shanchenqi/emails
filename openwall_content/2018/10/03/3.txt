In my experience the MITRE form is significantly more reliable and faster mechanism than the DWF form.  I realize this is perhaps a chicken-and-egg problem, where DWF might not be fast until they get enough traffic that they have to be fast, but MITRE is fast *today*, so any individual CVE requestor is probably better suited to use MITRE.
