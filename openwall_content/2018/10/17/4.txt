An attacker could exploit this by sending a crafted QMP  command (including guest-file-read with a large count value) to the agent via  the listening socket to trigger a g_malloc() call with a large memory chunk  resulting in a segmentation fault.  A user could use this flaw to crash the Qemu-guest-agent resulting in DoS.  Upstream Patch:    ->  This issue was reported by Fakhri Zulkifli.
