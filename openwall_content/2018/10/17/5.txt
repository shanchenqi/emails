By presenting the server an SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_SUCCESS message in place of the SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST message which the server would expect to initiate authentication, the attacker could successfully authentciate without any credentials. > > The bug was discovered by Peter Winter-Smith of NCC Group. > ----- > > This only affects libssh operating in _server_ mode, but not the usual used client mode. > > Ciao, Marcus   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
