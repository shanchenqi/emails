Memory allocations would build to extremely large values across  hundreds of rendered pages.  Use of Ghostscript in interactive  programs is still surely common.  Programs using libgs will inherit  any leaks.  These leaks and other issues should be fixed.  Keep in mind that Ghostscript is also used to render/view PDF files.  When interactively viewing it is common to do just-in-time rendering.  Even for bulk conversions, conversion on a page-by-page basis will  save resources when dealing with many pages.  Alternatives do exist now for PDF due to Xpdf and the derived Poppler  project and Poppler has become heavily used.  Ghostscript is still more competent at rendering PDF than Poppler is.  Ghostscript is able to deal with CMYK color spaces, per-object  colorspaces, and transparency, and it is able to render to various  quality levels (bilevel, grayscale, RGB, RGBA, CMYK) depending on the  output driver selected.
