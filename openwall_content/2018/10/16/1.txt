By presenting the server an SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_SUCCESS message in place of the SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST message which the server would expect to initiate authentication, the attacker could successfully authentciate without any credentials.  The bug was discovered by Peter Winter-Smith of NCC Group. -----  This only affects libssh operating in _server_ mode, but not the usual used client mode.
