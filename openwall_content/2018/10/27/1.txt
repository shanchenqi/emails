But I  now discovered that even this is not resistant against MitM attacks:   "[...] modern gpg automatically applies an import screener that only  accepts OpenPGP certificates that have the given fingerprint [...]  However, it's possible for someone else to make a new OpenPGP  certificate that includes the key in question without knowledge of the  secret key (e.g. as a non-cross-signed subkey).  As a result, an attacker can bypass the import screener and inject new  primary keys into the keyring.
