The -modulepath argument can be used to specify an insecure path to modules that are going to be loaded in the X server, allowing to execute unprivileged code in the privileged process.  The -logfile argument can be used to overwrite arbitrary files in the file system, due to incorrect checks in the parsing of the option.  This issue has been assigned  Background ==========  The commit which first appeared in xorg-server introduced a regression in the security checks performed for potentially dangerous options, enabling the vulnerabilities listed above.  Overwriting /etc/shadow with -logfile can also lead to privilege elevation since it's possible to control some part of the written log file, for example using the -fp option to set the font search path (which is logged) and thus inject a line that will be considered as valid by some systems.  Patches =======  A patch for the issue was added to the xserver repository on October 25,   Workaround ==========  If a patched version of the X server is not available, X.Org recommends to remove the setuid bit (ie chmod of the installed Xorg binary.  Note that this can cause issues if people are starting the X window system using the 'startx', 'xinit' commands or variations thereof.  X.Org recommends the use of a display manager to start X sessions, which does not require Xorg to be installed setuid.  Thanks ======  X.Org thanks Narendra Shinde who discovered and reported the issue, and the Red Hat Product Security Team who helped understand all impacts.  --  Matthieu Herrb  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
