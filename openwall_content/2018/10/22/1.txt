Notably libmspack is also used in clamav.  Forwarding the release notes here:  --------------------------  Hello all,  cabextract 1.8 has been released. It greatly improves its ability to  extract damaged files with the "-f" option, and the cabinfo command has  been rewritten.  It also fixes this bug:  * if a CAB file has a Quantum-compressed datablock with exactly  compressed bytes, cabextract will write exactly one byte beyond its  input buffer.  cabextract can be downloaded from https://www.cabextract.org.uk/  sums:     cabextract-1.8.tar.gz  libmspack 0.8alpha has also been released.  It adds the new parameter MSCABD_PARAM_SALVAGE which permits salvaging  badly damaged files rather than rejecting them outright.  It fixes several bugs:  * the above Quantum CAB block bug * libmspack now also rejects blank CHM filenames that are blank because  they have embedded null bytes, not just because they are zero-length * chmextract now protects you from absolute/relative pathnames in CHM   files  libmspack can be downloaded from https://www.cabextract.org.uk/libmspack/  sum:   libmspack-0.8alpha.tar.gz  If you wish to patch an older version, please look at commits  and in the git repository.|  Regards Stuart    --  Hanno Bรถck https://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
