Most GNU/Linux distributions ensure that only very special binaries (such as some versions of the Ada compiler) enable executable stacks. In our experience, if the toolchain produces a binary that requests an executable stack, it is more likely due to manually written assembler files without the required stack executability markup section, and not due to nested C functions whose address escapes.  Without scanning built binaries for these discrepancies, such cases could easily be missed.  Please also note that an executable stack is not a vulnerability itself, and it is not directly exploitable.  (The same applies to the lack of Intel CET support in binaries.)
