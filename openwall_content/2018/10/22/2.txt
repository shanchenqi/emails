Most of the time the unpacked source  package will have patches applied, so there's no need for the reviewer  to run untrusted code to prepare the source.  (That said, dpkg-source had quite a few path traversal bugs in the  past[1] and I have a hunch there's more to be found...)  While debian/rules can have optional "patch" target[2] (which is a bit  like RPM's %prep), it felt to disuse these days. A developer wouldn't  call "debian/rules patch" against a random not-yet-reviewed package,  because it would be unusual to have this target implemented.
