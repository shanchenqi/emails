I am demonstrating the remote denial of service vulnerability in the centos desktop version of the ipsec feature.Ipsec is currently the most widely used vpn technology, it uses ah protocol or esp protocol to encrypt or authenticate ip packets.   My test is divided into two parts. The first part is to open the ipsec function, which is what ah_add.c does. He didn't do too much, just opened a transfer mode ah protocol, ipsec is divided into ah protocol and esp Protocol, for simplicity, I set the encryption length to 0, which is my only non-mainstream operation.   The second part sends a special ah protocol packet, triggering the delayed release of the skb effect, causing the memory to be released in time, causing accumulation, and finally leading to denial of service.       The purpose of ah_add.c is just to register an IPSec encrypted channel. For simplicity, I set the encryption authentication length to 0.   In theory, as long as the target machine starts the ipsec function and allows ipsec message interaction with the target machine, it can cause the target machine to refuse service by sending a data packet.     Ah_add is just an operation that starts the ipsec service and allows the interaction with the target to be encrypted with a length of 0.
