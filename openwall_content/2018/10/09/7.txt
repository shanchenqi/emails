However, Tika reuses SAXParsers and calls reset() after each parse, which, for Xerces2 parsers, as per the documentation, removes the user-specified SecurityManager and thus removes entity expansion limits after the first parse. Apache Tika is therefore still vulnerable to entity expansions which can lead to a denial of service attack.  Mitigation: Apache Tika users should upgrade to or later  Credit: This issue was discovered by Slava Gorelik of CloudAlly.
