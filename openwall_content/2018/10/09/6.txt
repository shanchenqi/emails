If you do need untrusted ps, I think treating it the same as shell script file you downloaded from the internet.  I mean, technically there's a bash restricted mode and python rexec, but you probably wouldn't run it on random things you just downloaded.  gs -dSAFER and bash -r are useful features, but I think ever invoking them automatically without prompts about trust, etc, is just asking for trouble.
