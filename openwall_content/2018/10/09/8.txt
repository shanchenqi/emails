All papers seem to be available as PDF, some additionally as PS.  Which also makes sense: Many browsers support direct PDF display. While PDF is also a complex format with pitfalls I'd still trust the in-browser PDF readers much more than something like ghostscript.  If there are sites that rely on PS documents they should probably be encouraged to do a server-side sandboxed auto-conversion of them and offer PDF also.  --  Hanno Bรถck https://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
