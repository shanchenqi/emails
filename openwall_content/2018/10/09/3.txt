Back in August, Dave Hansen reported what may be ways to bypass PTI protection in the Linux kernel in some cases.  Dave's fixes got into Linux but maybe not into any other releases nor into distros, except for those that updated to (apparently, some SUSE branch and some Yocto branch?)  Start of a relevant thread:   The Subject says "close two Meltdown leaks with Global kernel mapping", but it isn't immediately clear to me what "two" leaks there are.  Only one appears to be clearly described:   The corresponding commit:   There are mentions of "r/w kernel text issue" and "unused hole" issue - is this why "two"?  But "r/w kernel text" feels irrelevant to Meltdown.  I've attached the two LKML postings above for archival on oss-security as well.
