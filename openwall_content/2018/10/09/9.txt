Due to its valuable current usages (e.g. printing and format  conversion) and its long legacy, Postscript is still a vital format to  support in open source software.  How can software consuming Postscript be aware of its origin unless it  is known to be produced directly by another application?  Edge applications such as web browsers may be able to help by adding  warning dialogs when knowingly downloading Postscript content.
