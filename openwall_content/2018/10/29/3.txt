The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * Pipeline: Groovy * Script Security  Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  The Groovy Sandbox library used by Script Security Plugin and Pipeline Groovy Plugin did not apply sandbox restrictions to finalize methods. This could be used to invoke arbitrary constructors and methods, bypassing sandbox protection.  Finalize methods are now prohibited in classes subject to sandbox security.
