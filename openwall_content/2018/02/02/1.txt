An error in the vhci_hcd driver can be exploited to disclose otherwise restricted kernel memory address.   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a USB device attached over IP.   The vulnerability is confirmed in version and reported in versions 4.4.x prior to 4.9.x prior to and prior to Other versions may also be affected.   ======================================================================  4) Solution   Update to version or   ======================================================================  5) Time Table   - Linux Kernel team contacted with vulnerability details. - Linux Kernel team confirmed the vulnerability. - Public disclosure of the vulnerability. - Release of Secunia Advisory - Public disclosure of Secunia Research Advisory. - Moved this vulnerability from Secunia Advisory              to Updated Secunia Research Advisory              due to a GIT commit having been applied and certain              fixed versions having been released. - Updated due to an update of Secunia Advisory - Updated due to an update of Secunia Advisory   ======================================================================  6) Credits   Jakub Jirasek, Secunia Research at Flexera.   ======================================================================  7) References   The Flexera CNA has assigned the identifier for the vulnerability through the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project.   ======================================================================  8) About Flexera   Flexera helps application producers and enterprises increase application usage and the value they derive from their software.   http://www.flexera.com   Flexera delivers market-leading Software Vulnerability Management solutions enabling enterprises to proactively identify and remediate software vulnerabilities, effectively reducing the risk of costly security breaches.   https://www.flexera.com/enterprise/products/   Flexera supports and contributes to the community in several ways. We have always believed that reliable vulnerability intelligence and tools to aid identifying and fixing vulnerabilities should be freely available for consumers to ensure that users, who care about their online privacy and security, can stay secure. Only a few vendors address vulnerabilities in a proper way and help users get updated and stay secure. End-users (whether private individuals or businesses) are otherwise left largely alone, and that is why back in Secunia Research started investigating, coordinating disclosure and verifying software vulnerabilities. In Secunia Research became a part of Flexera and today our in-house software vulnerability research remains the core of the Software Vulnerability Management products at Flexera.   https://www.flexera.com/enterprise/company/about/secunia-research/   The public Secunia Advisory database contains information for researchers, security enthusiasts, and consumers to lookup individual products and vulnerabilities and assess, whether they need to take any actions to secure their systems or whether a given vulnerability has already been discovered   https://secuniaresearch.flexerasoftware.com/community/advisories/   ======================================================================  9) Verification   Please verify this advisory by visiting the Secunia Research website:   ======================================================================     Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
