An error in the "get_pipe()" function (drivers/usb/usbip/stub_rx.c) can be exploited to cause an out-of-bounds read memory access and subsequently trigger a BUG() failure and a kernel crash by sending a specially crafted USB over IP packet.   An error in the "stub_recv_cmd_submit()" function (drivers/usb/usbip/stub_rx.c) when handling CMD_SUBMIT packets can be exploited to trigger an arbitrary memory allocation and subsequently cause a kernel crash by sending a specially crafted USB over IP packet.   These vulnerabilities are confirmed in version and reported in versions 4.4.x prior to 4.9.x prior to and prior to Other versions may also be affected.   An error in the "stub_send_ret_submit()" function (drivers/usb/usbip/stub_tx.c) can be exploited to trigger a NULL pointer dereference and subsequently cause a kernel crash by sending a specially crafted USB over IP packet.   Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities requires USB over IP daemon (usbipd) to be running.   This vulnerability is confirmed in version and reported in versions 4.1.x prior 4.4.x prior to 4.9.x prior to and prior to Other versions may also be affected.   ======================================================================  4) Solution   Update to version or   ======================================================================  5) Time Table   - Linux Kernel team contacted with vulnerability details. - Linux Kernel team confirmed the vulnerabilities. - Public disclosure of the vulnerabilities. - Release of Secunia Advisory - Public disclosure of Secunia Research Advisory. - Split Secunia Advisory into Secunia Advisories              and concerning the              vulnerabilities.

We have always believed that reliable vulnerability intelligence and tools to aid identifying and fixing vulnerabilities should be freely available for consumers to ensure that users, who care about their online privacy and security, can stay secure. Only a few vendors address vulnerabilities in a proper way and help users get updated and stay secure. End-users (whether private individuals or businesses) are otherwise left largely alone, and that is why back in Secunia Research started investigating, coordinating disclosure and verifying software vulnerabilities. In Secunia Research became a part of Flexera and today our in-house software vulnerability research remains the core of the Software Vulnerability Management products at Flexera.   https://www.flexera.com/enterprise/company/about/secunia-research/   The public Secunia Advisory database contains information for researchers, security enthusiasts, and consumers to lookup individual products and vulnerabilities and assess, whether they need to take any actions to secure their systems or whether a given vulnerability has already been discovered   https://secuniaresearch.flexerasoftware.com/community/advisories/   ======================================================================  9) Verification   Please verify this advisory by visiting the Secunia Research website:   ======================================================================    Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
