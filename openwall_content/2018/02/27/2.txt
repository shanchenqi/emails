ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Guests have the ability to request removal of memory from themselves. This operation is intended to be requested for normal read/write pages, but is also permitted to be used on other types of pages.  So far this in particular included pages pinned to their current type, with the necessary unpinning happening implicitly.  The unpinning of higher level page tables can, however, take a significant amount of time, and hence is generally expected to be carried out with intermediate preemption checks.  Such checks were missing from the code path involved here.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest administrator can cause a Denial of Service (DoS). Specifically, prevent use of a physical CPU for a significant period of time.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen versions are vulnerable.  Only x86 systems are affected.  ARM systems are not affected.  Only PV guests can leverage this vulnerability.  HVM guests cannot leverage this vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only HVM guests will avoid this issue.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Jann Horn of Google Project Zero.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            xen-unstable, Xen       Xen 4.9.x, Xen 4.8.x       Xen 4.7.x       Xen 4.6.x, Xen 4.5.x  $      $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
