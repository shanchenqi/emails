While implementing DNSSEC validation into Knot Resolver, we forgot to implement additional conditions explained in RFC so our DNSSEC validator could accept an NSEC or NSEC3 RR proofs from an ancestor zone as proving the nonexistence of an RR in a child zone.   Please note that Knot Resolver versions older than latest 1.5.z are obsolete and not maintained by CZ.NIC anymore so all users all advised to upgrade immediatelly to to latests 1.5 or 2.0 branches.  Version 1.5.z is going to be end-of-life in approximatelly one month so direct upgrade to version 2.0 or later is strongly recommended.
