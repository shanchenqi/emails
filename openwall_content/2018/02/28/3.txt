This only partly answers your question, but the oss-fuzz issues are handled in a public bug tracker (public as in "they become public once they're fixed or a deadline has passed" I believe): https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list  You'll find issues in sqlite, file and libarchive there, but of course that doesn't give you a mapping to the CVEs assigned.  --  Hanno Bรถck https://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
