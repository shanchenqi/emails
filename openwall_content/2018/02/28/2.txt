Hi, Apple has assigned a few CVE IDs for open source components not engineered at Apple:  refers to  file   Available for: OS X Mountain Lion and later   Impact: Multiple issues in file   Description: Multiple issues were addressed by updating to version   found by OSS-Fuzz   found by OSS-Fuzz   found by OSS-Fuzz   found by OSS-Fuzz   found by OSS-Fuzz   found by OSS-Fuzz  SQLite   Available for: iPhone 5s and later, iPad Air and later, and iPod touch 6th generation   Impact: Multiple issues in SQLite   Description: Multiple issues were addressed by updating to version   found by OSS-Fuzz   found by OSS-Fuzz   found by OSS-Fuzz   found by OSS-Fuzz  SQLite   Available for: iPhone 5s and later, iPad Air and later, and iPod touch 6th generation   Impact: An application may be able to execute arbitrary code with system privileges   Description: A memory corruption issue was addressed with improved memory handling.   an anonymous researcher  refers to:  libarchive   Available for: macOS Sierra OS X El Capitan   Impact: Unpacking a maliciously crafted archive may lead to arbitrary code execution   Description: Multiple memory corruption issues existed in libarchive. These issues were addressed through improved input validation.   found by OSS-Fuzz  libarchive   Available for: macOS Sierra OS X El Capitan   Impact: Unpacking a maliciously crafted archive may lead to arbitrary code execution   Description: A buffer overflow issue was addressed through improved memory handling.   found by OSS-Fuzz   found by OSS-Fuzz  file   Available for: macOS Sierra OS X El Capitan   Impact: Multiple issues in file   Description: Multiple issues were addressed by updating to version    PCRE   Available for: macOS Sierra OS X El Capitan   Impact: Multiple issues in pcre   Description: Multiple issues were addressed by updating to version    Of the IDs mentioned above, only refers to specific, identifiable information. Does anyone on the list have additional information on any of these bugs; allowing to map them to upstream bug reports/patches?  Why does the Apple CNA have a mandate to assign CVE IDs to generic FLOSS components not written by Apple to begin with? Especially if they're not participating in standard open source security information sharing practices.
