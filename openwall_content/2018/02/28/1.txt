Thank you, to those who were informed in advance, for cooperating with our disclosure schedule.  The two DHCP vulnerabilities are:     A specially constructed response from a    malicious server can cause a buffer overflow in dhclient        A malicious client can overflow a    reference counter in ISC dhcpd     And the (Supported Preview Edition-only) BIND vulnerability is:     A malformed request can trigger an    assertion failure in badcache.c     If you have questions about these announcements please direct them to security-officer@....org   Michael McNally ISC Security Officer  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
