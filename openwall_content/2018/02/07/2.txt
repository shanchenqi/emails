Using a handcrafted message, remote code execution seems to be possible.  A patch exists already and is being tested.  Currently we're unsure about the severity, we *believe*, an exploit is difficult. A mitigation isn't known.  Next steps:  * t0:     Distros will get access to our "security" non-public git repo           (based on the SSH keys known to us) * t0 +7d: Patch will be published on the official public git repo  t0 will be around  Timeline --------  * Report from Meh Chang <meh@...co.re> via exim-security mailing list * Request CVE on https://cveform.mitre.org/ (heiko)              * Announcement to the public via exim-users, exim-maintainers              mailing lists and on oss-security mailing list  Updates will follow. Here and on (Link will start to exist around UTC).
