Resolution: Users of Qpid Dispatch Router versions and must upgrade to version or and later.  Mitigation: Any user who is able to connect to the Router may exploit the vulnerability. If anonymous authentication is enabled then any remote user with network access the Router is a possible attacker. The number of possible attackers is reduced if the Router is configured to require authentication. Then an attacker needs to have authentic credentials which are used to create a connection to the Router before proceeding to exploit this vulnerability.
