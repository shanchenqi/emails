This could allow an attacker to get Access to JMeterEngine and send unauthorized code. This only affect tests running in Distributed mode.  Mitigation:   * Users must use last version of Java 8 or Java 9   * Users must upgrade to last JMeter 4.0 version and use the default / enabled authenticated SSL RMI connection.  Besides, we remind users that in distributed mode, JMeter makes an Architectural assumption that it is operating on a 'safe' network. i.e. everyone with access to the network is considered trusted.  This typically means a dedicated VPN or similar is being used.   Example:   * Start JMeter server using either jmeter-server or jmeter -s   * If JMeter listens on unsecure rmi connection (ie you can connect to it using a JMeter client), you are vulnerable  Credit: This issue was reported responsibly to the Apache Tomcat Security Team by Brenden Meeder.  - Philippe Mouawad  on behalf of the Apache JMeter PMC  [0]   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
