Software: --------- Doorkeeper (https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper)  Description: ------------ Doorkeeper is an OAuth 2 provider for Rails written in Ruby.  Affected Versions: ------------------ -  Fixed Versions: --------------- or later  Problem: -------- Stored XSS on the OAuth Client's name will cause users being prompted for consent via the "implicit" grant type to execute the XSS payload.  The XSS attack could gain access to the user's active session, resulting in account compromise.  Any user is susceptible if they click the authorization link for the malicious OAuth client. Because of how the links work, a user cannot tell if a link is malicious or not without first visiting the page with the XSS payload.  The requirement for this attack to be dangerous in the wild is the software using Doorkeeper must allow regular users to create or edit OAuth client applications.  If 3rd parties are allowed to create OAuth clients in the app using Doorkeeper, upgrade to the patched versions immediately.  Additionally there is stored XSS in the native_redirect_uri form element.  DWF has assigned  Solution: --------- Upgrade to Doorkeeper or later  Timeline: --------- Discovered by Gauthier Monserand[0] Fix prepared by Gauthier Monserand[1] Maintainer released patched version CVE requested CVE assigned via DWF Bulletin published[2]  Acknowledgements: ----------------- Credit to Gauthier Monserand (https://github.com/simkim) for finding and fixing this vulnerability.
