The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * Coverity Plugin * CppNCSS Plugin 1.2 * Environment Injector Plugin * Gerrit Trigger Plugin * Git Plugin * Google Play Android Publisher Plugin 1.7 * Job and Node ownership Plugin * Mercurial Plugin 2.3 * promoted builds Plugin 3.0 * Subversion Plugin * TestLink Plugin  Additionally, one plugin was removed from distribution as it has been  deprecated in and there are no plans to fix its security issue:  - Azure Slave Plugin  Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you find security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  EnvInject plugin stores environment variables in order to visualize them in  the "Injected Environment Variables" view. Sensitive build variables,  typically passwords, are exempt from this behavior. Plugin versions older  than (released on Mar 08, however did not exempt sensitive  variables, and persisted them on disk too. Such persisted sensitive  variables may be displayed by any release of this plugin for builds run  before it was updated to version or newer.  While the bug persisting sensitive build variables has been addressed in release there is no fix addressing this problem for historical build data.  To prevent the further exposure of sensitive build variables, we recommend that you (temporarily) disable the visualization of Injected Environment variables in the global configuration, then remove the sensitive data from disk by manually removing corresponding entries from injectedEnvVars.txt files, or deleting the injectedEnvVars.txt files in old build directories, and rotate all secrets that have potentially been exposed.   The Coverity Plugin stored passwords unencrypted as part of its configuration. This allowed users with Jenkins master local file system access and Jenkins administrators to retrieve the stored password. The latter could result in exposure of the passwords through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.   Missing permission checks in Gerrit Trigger Plugin allowed users with Overall/Read permission to access a form that showed the configuration of Gerrit servers in Jenkins. The key file password was only shown in its encrypted form, if configured. Other options were plainly visible.   Missing permission checks in Gerrit Trigger Plugin allowed users with Overall/Read permission to perform the following actions:  - Configure Gerrit servers - Connect and disconnect configured Gerrit servers   Job and Node ownership Plugin did not prevent the ownership metadata being overwritten when a job or node configuration was updated from the CLI or using the remote API (POST config.xml).  This allowed users with Job/Configure permission but without ManageOwnership/Jobs permission to change job ownership metadata, and users with Computer/Configure but without ManageOwnership/Nodes to change node ownership metadata.   / The Azure Slave Plugin bundles a version of the httpclient library that is vulnerable to  As the plugin has been deprecated in favor of Azure VM Agents Plugin in there are no plans to release a fix. It has been removed from distribution per request by the former maintainers.   CppNCSS Plugin did not properly escape the report name and graph name, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability.   Google Play Android Publisher Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users configuring a job to select the one they’d like to use to authenticate with the Google Play API.  This functionality did not check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credential IDs. Those could be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.  Additionally, a related form validation function would allow verification whether a specified credential is valid for use with the Google Play API.   The class handling unauthenticated Git post-commit hook notification requests at the /git/ path unnecessarily extended another type that handled requests to the …/search/ sub-path.  This allowed submission of search queries to Jenkins, and getting a list of search results usually available to anyone with Overall/Read permission. In current Jenkins releases, those are typically the names of known users (both actual users of Jenkins, and known SCM committers) and nodes (master and agents).   The class handling unauthenticated Subversion post-commit hook notification requests at the /subversion/ path unnecessarily extended another type that handled requests to the …/search/ sub-path.  This allowed submission of search queries to Jenkins, and getting a list of search results usually available to anyone with Overall/Read permission. In current Jenkins releases, those are typically the names of known users (both actual users of Jenkins, and known SCM committers) and nodes (master and agents).   The class handling unauthenticated Mercurial post-commit hook notification requests at the /mercurial/ path unnecessarily extended another type that handled requests to the …/search/ sub-path.  This allowed submission of search queries to Jenkins, and getting a list of search results usually available to anyone with Overall/Read permission. In current Jenkins releases, those are typically the names of known users (both actual users of Jenkins, and known SCM committers) and nodes (master and agents).   Users with Job/Configure permission were able to configure TestLink reports to display arbitrary unescaped HTML e.g. in test case names.   In Promoted Builds Plugin, users with Job/Read access were able to approve and re-execute promotion processes with a manual promotion condition that did not specify a list of users allowed to manually approve the promotion.
