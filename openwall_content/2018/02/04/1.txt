You should > definitely change your webhook auth if your logs indicate attempted > exploit. >  > More information >  > Anymail's webhook validation was vulnerable to a timing attack. An > attacker could have used this to obtain your WEBHOOK_AUTHORIZATION > shared secret, potentially allowing them to post fabricated or > malicious email tracking events to your app. >  > There have not been any reports of attempted exploit. (The > vulnerability was discovered through code review.) Attempts would be > visible in HTTP logs as a very large number of responses on > Anymail's webhook urls (by default "/anymail/esp_name/tracking/"), > and in Python error monitoring as a very large number of > AnymailWebhookValidationFailure exceptions.  There is the upstream fix for v1.3 and  Regards, Salvatore  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
