Please see:      The CERT vulnerability note is at:      Quagga advisories are at the URIs in the release announcement, also  available via either of:     https://gogs.quagga.net/Quagga/quagga/src/master/doc/security    https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/quagga.git/tree/doc/security  can be triggered by receiving a transitive BGP  attribute - meaning it potentially could be triggered by a message sent  by a BGP speaker far away. It involves a double-free, which could be  serious, depending on the malloc implementation. See:     Vendors are encouraged to provide backports to older releases.  Quagga users should upgrade to a release appropriate for their stability  needs with the relevant fixes applied.  regards, - --  Paul Jakma | paul@...ma.org | @pjakma | Key ID:  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----  =YNE6 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
