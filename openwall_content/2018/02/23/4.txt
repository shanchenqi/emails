I do not know where you looked at our code, but in our official git  repositories for vncterm[1] and spiceterm[2]  those issues are already fixed (since  i changed those variables all to unsigned int, which makes those  increments defined behavior, and the range checks are ok, because they cannot be negative anymore. (it may behave strange, but you cannot trigger an out-of-bounds  read/write anymore) also, i replaced the vt->cy += buf code paths with calls to vncterm_gotoxy (which as you mentioned, perform all necessary checks)  Dominik  [1]: https://git.proxmox.com/?p=vncterm.git;a=summary [2]: https://git.proxmox.com/?p=spiceterm.git;a=summary   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
