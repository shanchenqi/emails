Because security constraints defined in this way apply to the URL pattern and any URLs below that point, it was possible - depending on the order Servlets were loaded - for some security constraints not to be applied. This could have exposed resources to users who were not authorised to access them.  Mitigation: Users of the affected versions should apply one of the following mitigations. Upgrade to: - Apache Tomcat or later - Apache Tomcat or later - Apache Tomcat or later - Apache Tomcat or later  Credit: This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat Security Team.
