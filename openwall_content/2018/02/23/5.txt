If so, this seems worth mentioning.  The problem typically occurs with security annotations on servlets. In this case the security annotations pick up the mappings from the servlet they are annotating. If you changed the servlet mapping from "" to "/" that would almost certainly significantly change the behaviour of the web application since you are changing the mapping from "exact match to context root" to "default servlet".
