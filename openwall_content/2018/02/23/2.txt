This caused the constraint to be ignored. It was, therefore, possible for unauthorised users to gain access to web application resources that should have been protected. Only security constraints with a URL pattern of the empty string were affected.  Mitigation: Users of the affected versions should apply one of the following mitigations: - Review security constraints and confirm none use a URL patten of ""   (the empty string) - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat or later - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat or later - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat or later - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat or later  Credit: This issue was reported publicly as bug and the security implications identified by the Apache Tomcat Security Team.
