If an unprivileged user gains access to the Geode locator, they may be able to cause remote code execution if certain classes are present on the classpath.  A malicious user can send a network message to the Geode locator and execute code if certain classes are present on the classpath.  Mitigation: Users of the affected versions should upgrade to Apache Geode or later.  In addition, users should set the flag validate-serializable-objects.  Credit: This issue was reported responsibly to the Apache Geode Security Team by Man Yue Mo from Semmle.
