Certain cluster operations and API invocations cause these objects to be deserialized.  An user with DATA:WRITE access to the cluster may be able to cause remote code execution if certain classes are present on the classpath.  Mitigation: Users of the affected versions should upgrade to Apache Geode or later.  In addition, users should set the flags validate-serializable-objects and serializable-object-filter.  Credit: This issue was reported responsibly to the Apache Geode Security Team by Man Yue Mo from Semmle.
