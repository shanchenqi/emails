In  nested_get_vmcs12_pages(), in case of an error while processing posted  interrupt address, it unmaps the 'pi_desc_page' without resetting 'pi_desc'  descriptor address. Which is latter used in pi_test_and_clear_on().  A guest user/process could use this flaw to crash the host kernel resulting in  DoS.  Upstream patch: ---------------    ->  This issue was reported by Cfir Cohen of google.com.
