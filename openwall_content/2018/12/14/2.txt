Actually, that wouldn't answer this exact question - it'd answer a similar question about tracked vulnerabilities, and the answer would tell us how frequently a vulnerability would need to be patched on a system (apparently, 1/8 of the time for RHEL7 vs. latest mainline now).  We can't answer the question about untracked vulnerabilities from per-vulnerability data because untracked implies we lack such data.
