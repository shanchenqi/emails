Web Key Directory or WKD [1] is a feature where OpenPGP keys can be fetched via a defined web address of the form  Enigmail automatically tries to fetch WKD keys already when writing a mail, so simply having a mail address in "To" will cause an HTTPS request.  When the server answers with a HTTP authentication challenge (HTTP code then Enigmail/Thunderbird would open up an HTTP login window. While the login window will show the hostname, this can be very confusing for a user. If randomly a login window pops up within a mail client it's plausible that some users will enter their email credentials. Here's a video to illustrate the issue: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFSMBX98XiE  Similar attacks in browsers have previously been described as "Cross-Site-Authentication" or XSA [2].  I think it would be good if the WKD draft would be updated to clarify that a client should never answer to any authentication requests from the server.   I discovered this together with Moritz Tremmel (We discovered this by accident due to a server serving HTTP authentication requests for every path starting with a dot). After we reported this to Enigmail we learned that this was previously reported in the public bug tracker:  [1] https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-koch-openpgp-webkey-service-07 [2] http://www.joachim-breitner.de/blog/56-Like_XSS,_just_simpler_and_harder_to_prevent__The_Cross_Site_Auth_(XSA)_Attack --  Hanno Bรถck https://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
