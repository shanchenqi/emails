This one is interesting in that related server-side code got some scrutiny before, yet apparently this similar issue in its client-side counterpart was overlooked.  (I assume this is in libvncclient/rfbproto.c, and you meant line not  Specifically, the oCERT advisory from based on "vulnerability report received from Nicolas Ruff of Google Security Team":   "A malicious VNC client can trigger multiple DoS conditions on the VNC server by advertising a large [...] ClientCutText message length [...]"  Per this wording, there was no integer overflow potential in the server-side code.  Just potentially maliciously large allocation.  This reminds us now: in the client-side code, we should also deal not only with the integer overflow potential, but also with potentially maliciously large allocation.  The thread I started earlier this year:   "LibVNCServer rfbserver.c: rfbProcessClientNormalMessage() case rfbClientCutText doesn't sanitize msg.cct.length"  I did not look at the VNC client code as it was not relevant to the security audit I was working on when I found the server-side issue.
