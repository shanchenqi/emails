AFAICT there is no check that malloc succeeded before the code later writes to the frames array (the > same applies to playbuf.times). Poking around a bit more, this (unchecked malloc) seems common in the code.  checking malloc status is not enough, because playbuf.num_frames can be very large value, in my environment Ubuntu gcc it becomes             playbuf.frames = malloc((playbuf.num_frames + 1) * sizeof(void*)); So at this point it try to calculate + 1) * 8 = 0x8 (INTEGER OVERFLOW). As a result malloc succeed but it only allocate 0x8 byte buffer, lead OOB write at following points.      if (current_frame <= playbuf->num_frames) /* we only allocate enough for our estimate. */         playbuf->frames[current_frame] = playbuf->frames[current_frame-1] + (header->bitrate / 8 /             * mad_timer_count(header->duration, MAD_UNITS_MILLISECONDS);         playbuf->times[current_frame] = current_time;  The value of playbuf.num_frames may depend on platform because it's calculated from INF value. (undefined behavior) I only tried to Ubuntu package of (may be compiled by gcc?). At least on ubuntu, OOB write always happen due to above reason.
