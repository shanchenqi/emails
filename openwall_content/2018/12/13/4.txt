In pvrdma_realize() routine, if an error occurred, it  did not release memory resources allocated to various objects.  A guest user/process could use this flaw to leak host memory, resulting in DoS  for host.  Upstream patch: ---------------    ->  This issue was reported by Li Qiang of  Thank you. -- Prasad J Pandit / Red Hat Product Security Team 47AF CE69 54AA DD13 FE5B  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
