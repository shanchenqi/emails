As per my original advisory, which did not fully indicate the details but gave the overview of how to trigger the condition.  Cool, but I think this is a different bug (AFAICT, it's it was fixed in netkit, but far fewer distros use inetutils). I agree this was a real vulnerability, It's a pretty good sign inetutils should be deprecated imho.  Tavis.
