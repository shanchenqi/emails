So here is what I've done so far to reproduce this, initially, I omitted the steps to generate the htpasswd as I though they where not relevant, I'm adding them now for completeness:  The htpasswd password for the "user" is generated by htpasswd from (= on Debian  # Generate password "user" for "user" $ /usr/bin/htpasswd -c auth/.htpasswd user New password: <user> Re-type new password: <user> Adding password for user user  $ cat  auth/.htpasswd  Then a request is made to mini-httpd:  $ curl  This causes the mini-httpd to invoke crypt(3) with the following arguments cryptpass = crypt(key, salt), I've added printf's to mini_httpd.c to report the actual arguments being passed and the value returned by crypt():  $ mini_httpd -D -p -h -l /dev/stderr key "" salt cryptpass (null) errno 22 strerror Invalid argument  Then mini_httpd.c receives a SIGSEGV when performing strcmp() on the NULL cryptpass at The cause of the NULL return value is that the salt given to crypt() is invalid as show by errno=EINVAL.  So crypt(3) is setting errno=EINVAL to report that the htpasswd file generated by apache2-utils is not valid for being used with mini_httpd.
