NFS41+ shares mounted in different network namespaces at the same time can make bc_svc_process() use wrong back-channel id and cause a use-after-free. Thus a malicious container user can cause a host kernel memory corruption and a system panic. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out.  The id was assigned to this flaw and proposed to MITRE. We would like to suggest to use this id in public communications regarding this flaw.  A proposed patchset and a discussion:    References:   Best regards, Vladis Dronov | Red Hat, Inc. | Product Security Engineer  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
