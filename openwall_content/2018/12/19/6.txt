Their disclosure of the issue can be found via this page:     and more information can be found in their respective bug trackers:       The RedHat announcement is understandably focused mostly on the impact to customers using their packages, but because some of the other subscribers to this list distribute their own packages that are based on BIND we thought it might be helpful to provide some additional information about this CVE.  1)  The issue does not exist in any of the BIND source packages     provided directly by ISC.  2)  We have worked with RedHat to determine the root cause of     and have concluded that it was introduced     accidentally while backporting the Negative Trust Anchor (NTA)     feature to a branch of BIND prior to when it was introduced     in the upstream (ISC) version.  We would therefore advise     any other packagers who have backported NTA to the BIND 9.9     or codebase that they might want to investigate to see whether     they have similarly introduced a vulnerability in their code.     If you find that you have done so, please contact     security-officer@....org, as ISC are the CVE Numbering Authority     for BIND and we will need to be included in the discussion     as to whether any such vulnerabilities fall under     or require a separate CVE ID assignment.  If you are distributing BIND packages and have further questions we will do our best to answer them.
