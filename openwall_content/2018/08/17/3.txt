Unless it wraps is correct. To wrap the memory layout would have to have the kernel before the userspace and the memory buffer at the very end of memory. Neither Linux nor Windows which we support have these characteristics.  > This is more problematic here: >  > >     +            if (SPICE_UNLIKELY((start2 + 2 + cursor_u__nw_size) > > >     message_end)) { > >     +                goto error; > >     +            } >  > If cursor_u__nw_size results in pointer wraparound, the check might fail > incorrectly. >   cursor_u__nw_size is either 0 or 17, very hard to wrap, impossible in currently supported systems as stated earlier.  > The commit message quotes the right pattern, nw_size > (uintptr_t) > (message_end - start), but it is not used in the actual code AFAICS. >   Yes, check is not perfect and can be modified to support any possible technical systems. The check uses already present helpers, I think for the fix is better to stick to the current code, I'll see if I can support all cases as an improve.  > Thanks, > Florian >   Thanks,   Frediano  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
