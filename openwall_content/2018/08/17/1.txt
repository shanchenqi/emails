The generated code is used in both client and server, so both are vulnerable.  The most obvious outcome is a crash (since the overflowed integers are very large), but it's possible a crafty attacker could leverage this into worse, even RCE.  Demarshalling code is only used post-authentication, so attacking a server would require valid credentials.  The attached patch fixes both demarshal.py and the generated code.  This is planned to be included in forthcoming releases spice and spice-gtk   --  Doran Moppert Red Hat Product Security  View attachment of type "text/plain" bytes)  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
