This is more problematic here:  >     +            if (SPICE_UNLIKELY((start2 + 2 + cursor_u__nw_size) > message_end)) { >     +                goto error; >     +            }  If cursor_u__nw_size results in pointer wraparound, the check might fail  incorrectly.  The commit message quotes the right pattern, nw_size > (uintptr_t)  (message_end - start), but it is not used in the actual code AFAICS.
