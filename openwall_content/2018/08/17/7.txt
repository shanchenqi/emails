Thank you for the reference to the new CVE, I only had what was in the package changelog to go with and none of the trackers I know about reference as a duplicate/old name of so it was confusing. This is actually pretty reassuring that the rule is then appropriately respected.  That being said, if is public there really is no reason to say what they said in the discussions I have had with the RDMA folks, so I will work to clear that up.
