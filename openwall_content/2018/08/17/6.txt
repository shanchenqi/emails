There seems to be some miscommunation here, which should be directly clarified with the security team of the affected distribution(s).  Rule of thumb is: when a vendor publishes updates for an issue, the issue is public and can be referenced publically. I do not understand why you would get push back unless there are communication problems.  Also FWIW is an older reference to "Bounds Check Bypass Store", which is now tracked as and is public.
