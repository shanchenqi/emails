This code path may be used by an unprivileged user to check for   the existence of a path which they wouldn't otherwise be able to reach.    It may also be used to trigger side effects by causing a (read-only) open   of special kernel files (ptmx, proc, sys).  This was reported to us by Matthias Gerstner from SUSE and Christian Brauner on the LXC team took care of finding a workable solution and preparing the needed updates.   Fixes:  - stable-2.0:  - stable-3.0:  - master:  Linux distributions were privately notified with about a week notice and so should have security updates ready for this already, or will shortly.  We will not be issuing emergency release tarballs for this issue so if you're maintaining your own build, you should be cherry-picking one of the fixes above. We do however intend to release LXC very shortly which will include this fix among other traditional bugfixes.
