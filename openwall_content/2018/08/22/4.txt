The vulnerability is addressed in Cayenne by disabling XXE processing in all operations that require XML parsing.  Mitigation: 4.1.x users should upgrade to or newer. 4.0.x users should upgrade to 4.0 (GA release). 3.1.x users should upgrade to  References:  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Processing  --- Andrus Adamchik Apache Cayenne PMC Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
