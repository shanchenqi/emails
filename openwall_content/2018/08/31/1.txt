However, if someone hadn't considered the possibility of a SHA1 collision attack, and a signature verification fails, despite the fingerprint they see matching, what % of GPG users would skip signature verification? Perhaps due to confusion/self-doubt/inexperience/other. Admittedly, this could be stepping into the realm of social engineering.
