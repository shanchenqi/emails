Details from follow:  ---- When GdmDisplayStore (daemon/gdm-display-store.c) emits the "display-removed" signal, the GdmDisplay being removed has already been removed from the store. Subsequent calls to gdm_display_store_lookup from signal handlers using the display ID associated with the signal then fail to look up the removed display. In on_display_removed (daemon/gdm-manager.c), this results in the display object not being correctly unexported from the system bus. Subsequent D-Bus calls to the stale object trigger a use-after-free.  An unprivileged user can trigger this by creating a transient display, waiting a short time and then making D-Bus requests to it. ----  A fix for this can be found in the upstream git repository:  Many thanks, - Chris     Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
