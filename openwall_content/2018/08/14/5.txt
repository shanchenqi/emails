These might lead to memory corruptions. We assume that these are not easily exploitable. X41 did not perform a full test or audit on the software. Please note that the library is deprecated for more than a year and no update will be published by the vendor.   Product Description - ------------------- This is a C library to interact with the CCID-part of the YubiKey NEO. There is a command line tool "ykneomgr" for interactive use.  It supports querying the YubiKey NEO for firmware version, operation mode (OTP/CCID) and serial number.  You may also mode switch the device and manage applets (list, delete and install).  Out of Bounds Read/Writes ========================= Severity Rating: Medium Vector: APDU Response CVE: CWE: CVSS Score: 7.1 (High) CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H   Summary and Impact - ------------------ File lib/backendpcsc.c contains the following code in function `backendappletlist()`  {% highlight c %}      {        sizet i;        sizet thislen = recv[length++];        for (i = 0; i < thislen; i++)         {           if (appletstr)             {              if (reallen + 2 > *len)                 {                   return YKNEOMGRBACKENDERROR;                 }               sprintf (p, "%02x", recv[length]);               p += 2;             }           reallen += 2;           length++;         }       if (appletstr)         {           if (reallen + 1 > *len)             {               return YKNEOMGRBACKENDERROR;             }           *p = '\0';           p++;         }       reallen++;       length += 2;     } {% endhighlight %}  There is an off-by-one write of a '\x00' when the sprintf() is called, since it terminates the string with a trailing null-byte. Additionally reads are performed based on thislen, which is retrieved from the data without further safety checks.   Workarounds - ----------- It is advised to migrate to YubiKey Manager since the vendor does not support the library anymore and will not issue a patch.  Timeline ======== Issues found Vendor contacted Vendor reply Requesting technical feedback from the vendor Vendor confirms bug, but states that library is depreciated, will not be fixed Advisory released - --  X41 D-SEC GmbH, Dennewartstr.
