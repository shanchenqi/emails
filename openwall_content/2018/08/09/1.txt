Our official security advisory document is posted in the ISC Knowledge Base at this URL: but for your convenience the text is provided below.  Patched versions of BIND are available from https://www.isc.org/downloads  Michael McNally ISC Security Officer  ----------  A rarely-used feature in BIND has a flaw which can cause named to exit with an INSIST assertion failure.  CVE:                  Document Version:     2.0 Posting date:         08 August Program Impacted:     BIND Versions affected:                                                and also versions of BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition Severity:             High (but only for servers on which the "deny-answer-aliases"                       feature is explicitly enabled) Exploitable:          Remotely  Description:     "deny-answer-aliases" is a little-used feature intended to help    recursive server operators protect end users against DNS rebinding    attacks, a potential method of circumventing the security model    used by client browsers.  However, a defect in this feature makes    it easy, when the feature is in use, to experience an INSIST    assertion failure in name.c.  Impact:     Accidental or deliberate triggering of this defect will cause    an INSIST assertion failure in named, causing the named process    to stop execution and resulting in denial of service to clients.    Only servers which have explicitly enabled the "deny-answer-aliases"    feature are at risk and disabling the feature prevents exploitation.  CVSS Score:          7.5 CVSS Vector:         CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H  For more information on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System and to obtain your specific environmental score please visit:  Workarounds:     This vulnerability can be avoided by disabling the "deny-answer-aliases"    feature if it is in use.  Active exploits:     No known active exploits.  Solution:     Most operators will not need to make any changes unless they are    using the "deny-answer-aliases" feature (which is described in    the BIND 9 Adminstrator Reference Manual section 6.2.)    "deny-answer-aliases" is off by default; only configurations    which explicitly enable it can be affected by this defect.     If you are using "deny-answer-aliases", upgrade to the patched    release most closely related to your current version of BIND.     -     -     -     -      BIND Supported Preview Edition is a special feature preview    branch of BIND provided to eligible ISC support customers.     -   Acknowledgements:     ISC would like to thank Tony Finch of the University of Cambridge    for reporting this issue.
