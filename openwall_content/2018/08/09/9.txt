It is used in products like Red Hat Enterprise Satellite 5 and Spacewalk.  Upstream project is at : https://cobbler.github.io/   While diagnosing the following 2 flaws :  Another flaw has been found: cobbler exposes all functions from its CobblerXMLRPCInterface class over XMLRPC. However, python renames the __* function with _<classname>__<functionname>.  A remote, unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw by calling the real name of any __* function and gain high privileges within cobbler or upload files to arbitrary location in the context of the daemon.  This is identified as  All versions of cobbler (at least since are affected.  To reproduce the issue: use the reproducers from the report above and call any __<name> function as _CobblerXMLRPCInterface__<name>  The patch for this specific vulnerability (i.e.: it does *not* fix the vulnerability reported by movermeyer.com) :  ---  cobbler/remote.py | 3 +++  1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)  diff --git a/cobbler/remote.py b/cobbler/remote.py index --- a/cobbler/remote.py +++ b/cobbler/remote.py @@ @@ class ProxiedXMLRPCInterface:       def _dispatch(self, method, params, **rest):  +        if method.startswith('_'): +            raise CX("forbidden method") +          if not hasattr(self.proxied, method):              raise CX("unknown remote method")  ---   Best regards,  --  Cedric Buissart, Product Security   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
