About the same period, our secure e-mail provider suffered an unprecedented DDoS with some e-mail messages never reaching us. Since this has business impact, we consider legal action against the opaque Linux-distros vulnerability-disclosure-among-friends-for-fun-and-profit scheme, that we exposed at the ITU earlier this year. This is digital divide in the works, with real impact for non-club-members.  Regards, Stiepan A.
