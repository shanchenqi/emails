Obviously (to me), there was no deliberate attempt at censorship here.  I am sure the co-moderator simply didn't realize that rejecting your message could be construed as censorship.  I did realize that, and made the correction.  That's team work, not fighting.  > on what is supposed to be a list for managing security issues of open software.  It is.  > The issue is that it has gone so far from its original idea,  Has it?  That's not my impression.  The oss-security list is still similar to what it was when we started it 10 years ago.  > with the embargoes  Embargoes existed way before oss-security, and will continue to exist. When we started oss-security (in embargoes related to Linux distros (and more) were handled mostly on vendor-sec (IIRC, since and they could last arbitrarily long.  In we replaced vendor-sec with the (linux-)distros lists, which I think are better managed: we have a specific policy on max embargo duration (now 14 days max), etc. If CERT somehow didn't publicize this specific issue fully by now, we'd have made it public about now per the linux-distros list policy anyway, ignoring CERT (the sender to linux-distros accepted that responsibility). That's an improvement (even if a minor one) compared to the situation we had with CERT and vendor-sec at the time we just started running the oss-security list.  > and removal of direct CVE requests,  While the acceptance of CVE requests provided an incentive for people who are into collecting CVEs to report issues in here, it also resulted in "noise" in the sense that oss-security was too much of a CVE request list, unintentionally discouraging discussion on other desirable topics. With this noise gone, it is clearer to potential senders that this list is a place for such discussions.  > that legal action remains the only logical one,  Since you're thinking in such terms anyway, please consider that someone could also threaten legal action against someone disclosing a security issue without giving all vendors time to develop a fix.  There's no way to satisfy everyone's preferences at once, and legal action is no solution.  > for anyone not part of the "club".  Which "club"?  If you're an Open Source operating system distro, you can now apply to join (linux-)distros under our published criteria. Otherwise, yes, you're out of luck joining that "club".  This is "selective disclosure", and it has drawbacks.  There's no perfect alternative.  > As to getting some funding to run it properly  To run what properly?  Just the public list?  Previously, you suggested we get funding to run the "club", which you're now speaking against.
