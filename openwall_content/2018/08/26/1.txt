Well over 50% of all requests were for that one key.  I'm not the only one to have noticed and I know that I was not alone amongst keyserver operators in being annoyed that a free service to the community was suddenly being hammered by one actor.  I recall discussing with at least one person either blacklisting the key or the IP addresses used frequently for that key.  The keyservers are a swamp; if you want to include one key, then include the key as static data in your builds/CI configuration, so that it's coming from a trusted source each time: your own data.  If you're building infrastructure which needs to get data from off-site, then consider whether or not you can provide template directives which people can include in their command lists, and you then populate the template with the correct current commands for that directive.  Eg, if I'm talking to Docker inside Circle CI, I don't set a bunch of variables myself, I just say `setup_remote_docker` and let Circle CI figure out which commands should be run.  For "everything is a shell command" setup, then perhaps `$CICMD_APT_KEYS_UPDATE` could be made available. Or `"${CICMD_APT_KEYS_UPDATE[@]}"` if even more constrained.  -Phil  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
