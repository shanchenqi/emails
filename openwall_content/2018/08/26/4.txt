Indeed, as someone who helps design and run very large CI systems, I can say with certainty that every extra request you make in your jobs to retrieve something over a network connection is one more false negative failure waiting to happen. The Internet is _not_ reliable, and it becomes obvious when you start looking at connection failures and random API errors at scale from lots of different places on the planet. If there's basically static data that your job needs (especially public keys/certs) just bake it directly into the job itself, and for things that change more often than that cache as much of it as you can local to (or even directly on the filesystems of) the systems which run those jobs.  Unfortunately a lot of this sort of silliness comes about because people write CI jobs by translating their own developer environment configuration documentation or user guides into scripts and don't think about (or perhaps don't even understand in many cases) how technologies like OpenPGP work. --  Jeremy Stanley  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
