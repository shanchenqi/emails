Gday,  Syzkaller/syzbot found a use-after-free bug in the cryptographic subsystem of the Linux kernel [1], that can be used to panic the system and possibly escalate privileges.  The bug was introduced in commit and has been addressed in a reproducer is available on the tail end of  syzbots email to kernel list ( ).  Most RHEL kernels are not affected as they do not have the feature, but it does affect the kernel-alt package (the based kernel for 64-bit ARM , IBM POWER9 (little endian ) and IBM z Systems ).  Upstream fix:  Reproducer:  Thanks.  --  Wade Mealing  Product Security - Kernel  Red Hat  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
