Are we seriously now going to be assigning cves to everything that syzbot finds?  If so, great, this is going to be fun!  If not, why this specific patch?  What makes it specia from the hundreds of other syzbot finds that have been fixed (and not fixed yet)?  This seems like an odd choice, given:  > The bug was introduced in commit and has been addressed > in a reproducer is available > on the tail end of  syzbots email to kernel list ( > ).

So this was introduced in which was released Nov 12, and fixed in which was released on Dec 20,  A very small window, don't you think.  And one that happened almost a year ago.  If RHEL is not exposed, why does Red Hat care about this?  Who cares about it?  Anyone running a kernel has had this fixed for a very long time ago, and anyone not running a kernel is not affected.  Again, I'm really confused why this was chosen for a CVE here.  Care to explain it a bit better?  Is it because you have to have a CVE for every bugfix in the RHEL kernel-alt package (something that I would love to see happen for various other reasons...)  thanks,  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
