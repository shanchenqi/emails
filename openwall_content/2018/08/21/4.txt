Uninstalling Ghostscript entirely might cause software using libgs to  not execute at all unless a stub library is put in its place.  Dependencies on Ghostscript are much larger than one would initially  think due to Postscript being the traditional output from Unix  software for "printing" and thus it is used as an intermediate format  in order to convert between formats.  EPS content is also embedded in  some other formats.
