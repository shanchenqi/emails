In standalone, the config property 'spark.authenticate.secret' establishes a shared secret for authenticating requests to submit jobs via spark-submit. However, the REST API does not use this or any other authentication mechanism, and this is not adequately documented. In this case, a user would be able to run a driver program without authenticating, but not launch executors, using the REST API. This REST API is also used by Mesos, when set up to run in cluster mode (i.e., when also running MesosClusterDispatcher), for job submission. Future versions of Spark will improve documentation on these points, and prohibit setting 'spark.authenticate.secret' when running the REST APIs, to make this clear. Future versions will also disable the REST API by default in the standalone master by changing the default value of 'spark.master.rest.enabled' to 'false'.  Mitigation: For standalone masters, disable the REST API by setting 'spark.master.rest.enabled' to 'false' if it is unused, and/or ensure that all network access to the REST API (port by default) is restricted to hosts that are trusted to submit jobs. Mesos users can stop the MesosClusterDispatcher, though that will prevent them from running jobs in cluster mode. Alternatively, they can ensure access to the MesosRestSubmissionServer (port by default) is restricted to trusted hosts.
