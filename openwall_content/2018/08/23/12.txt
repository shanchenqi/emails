In that case ImageMagick is not linked against gslib and ghostscript is directly invoked via `gs' or similar.  If ImageMagick was built `--with-gslib' then no `gs' is invoked and there is no delegation, so the problems described by Tavis can be reproduced with that delegate policy rule as well.   It is probably safer to follow the workaround described in:  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
