Here is our (rough) timeline:  - On July 31,     is committed publicly, but does not explain the reasons for this   change, and does not flag it as a security fix.  - We read this commit about two weeks later, and realize its security   implications; we do not know whether distros@...openwall.org have been   contacted about this or not.  - We therefore send our findings to openssh@...nssh.com and   distros@...openwall.org, on August 15.  - About 20 minutes later (!), Solar Designer confirms that we should   post this to oss-security@...ts.openwall.com right away (as per   https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros): indeed,   the issue is already public (if we spotted this commit, then others   did, too).  - About one hour later, we post our findings to oss-security.  Again, we thank Dariusz Tytko for reporting this issue, distros@...openwall.org for their quick response, and the OpenSSH team for all their hard and inspiring work.
