Whoops, I stand corrected, sorry for the incorrect information! (at least when invoking them with the `PS2:' or `PS3:' prefixes, anyway, yes, both PS2 and PS3 policy rules are worth to be added as well).  (Regarding the `file.ps2' and `file.ps3' examples without `PS2:' or `PS3:' prefixes according `convert -debug Policy -log "%e"' it seems that they ends up as:   Domain: Coder; rights=Read; pattern="PS" ...  ...so should be blocked by the workaround described in But please correct me if I'm wrong.)  JFTR, not related to PS2 and PS3 but also a possible ghostcript consumer: EPT seems to ends up as `pattern="PS"' too (unlike PS2 and PS3).   Thank you!
