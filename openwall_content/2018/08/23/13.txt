You are missing something.  While they are unlikely to be triggered by  default (but still could be triggered by an attacker with sufficient  control), testing shows that     convert -verbose PS2:file.ps outfile.png    convert -verbose file.ps2 outfile.png    convert -verbose PS3:file.ps outfile.png    convert -verbose file.ps3 outfile.png  does in fact invoke Ghostscript.
