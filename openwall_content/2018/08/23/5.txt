Note that this may or may not work, depending on whether the MIME type  detection is identical between the selection of the evince and the  selection of the Ghostscript backend in evince itself.  I remember a case from several years ago where an ImageMagick bug was  still exploitable via mail user agents even though the problematic image  format was not listed in /etc/mailcap.  ImageMagick did its own format  detection back then, so all you had to do was to change the file extension.
