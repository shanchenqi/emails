I agree about the "key ID" part, but not about the "fingerprint" part. Pinning a cryptographic hash over a public key isn't a security antipattern by any strech of the imagination. Sure, you could argue that the SHA-1 used by GPG isn't state-of-the-art anymore, but we're not talking about collision attacks, but second preimage attacks. Far worse for the attacker.  The way you phrased it, however, all applications of fingerprints/hashes would be broken (SSH fingerprints, HPKP, etc.), regardless of the hash function they use.
