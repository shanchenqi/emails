ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The logic in oxenstored for handling writes depended on the order of evaluation of expressions making up a tuple.  As indicated in section "Operations on data structures" of the OCaml manual:    http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/expr.html  the order of evaluation of subexpressions is not specified.  In practice, different implementations behave differently.  IMPACT ======  oxenstored may not enforce the configured quota-maxentity.  This allows a malicious or buggy guest to write as many xenstore entries as it wishes, causing unbounded memory usage in oxenstored.  This can lead to a system-wide DoS.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen 4.1 and later are potentially vulnerable.  Only systems using the OCaml xenstored implementation are potentially vulnerable.  Systems using the C xenstored implementation are not vulnerable.  Whether the compiled oxenstored binary is vulnerable depends on which compiler was used.  OCaml can be compiled either as bytecode (with ocamlc) or as a native binary (with ocamlopt).  The following OCaml program demonstrates the issue, and identifies whether the resulting oxenstored binary will skip the quota enforcement.    $ cat order.ml   let check () =     let flag = ref false in     let update _ = flag := true; () in     List.iter update !flag    let main () =     let _, flag = check () in     if flag then     print_endline "This code is not vulnerable!"     else     print_endline "This code is vulnerable!"    let () = main ()    $ ocamlc order.ml -o order.bytecode   $ ./order.bytecode   This code is vulnerable!   $ ocamlopt order.ml -o order.native   $ ./order.native   This code is not vulnerable!  To confirm whether an OCaml binary is bytecode or native, use file.    $ file order.bytecode   order.bytecode: a /usr/bin/ocamlrun script executable (binary data)   $ file order.native   order.native: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, ...  NOTE: These results are applicable to OCaml as distributed in Debian Jessie.  These results are not representative of other versions of OCaml, or of other OS distributions.  MITIGATION ==========  There are no mitigations available.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Christian Lindig of Citrix.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            All versions of Xen  $   $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.   (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
