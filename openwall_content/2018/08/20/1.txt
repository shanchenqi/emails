ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The DEBUGCTL MSR contains several debugging features, some of which virtualise cleanly, but some do not.  In particular, Branch Trace Store is not virtualised by the processor, and software has to be careful to configure it suitably not to lock up the core.  As a result, it must only be available to fully trusted guests.  Unfortunately, in the case that vPMU is disabled, all value checking was skipped, allowing the guest to chose any MSR_DEBUGCTL setting it likes.  IMPACT ======  A malicious or buggy guest administrator can lock up the entire host, causing a Denial of Service.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen versions 4.6 and later are vulnerable.  Only systems using Intel CPUs are affected. ARM and AMD systems are unaffected.  Only x86 HVM or PVH guests can exploit the vulnerability.  x86 PV guests cannot exploit the vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only x86 PV guests avoids the vulnerability.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Andrew Cooper of Citrix.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            xen-unstable      Xen      4.9       Xen 4.8, 4.7, 4.6  $      $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.   (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
