ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Linux's netback driver allows frontends to control mapping of requests to request queues.  When processing a request to set or change this mapping, some input validation was missing or flawed.  IMPACT ======  A malicious or buggy frontend may cause the (usually privileged) backend to make out of bounds memory accesses, potentially resulting in one or more of privilege escalation, Denial of Service (DoS), or information leaks.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Linux kernel versions from 4.7 onwards are affected.  MITIGATION ==========  There is no known mitigation.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Felix Wilhelm of Google Project Zero.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.            Linux 4.7 ...  $  $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)  For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information, consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:   http://www.xenproject.org/security-policy.html -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =SC+y -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
