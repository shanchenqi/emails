It is apparently possible only if the -v option, or one of the other options that implies -v, is used.  This seems to have been first discovered in as a result of interaction between initramfs-tools and zutils, but was initially thought to be a bug in the gzip implementation of zcat:  It was eventually reported to the zutils upstream developer (Antonio Diaz Diaz, cc'd) in the last few weeks and was fixed in version  This was announced in:  I will request a CVE ID for this.
