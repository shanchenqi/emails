It depends on machine/BIOS. IIRC usually "non ht" logical cpus are enumerated in in SRAT before ht siblings (kernel goes over this table and boots cpus untill maxcpus is reached), so it will work fine, but I don't think it is standardized in any way. In /proc/cpuinfo among other things you have 1) Linux processor number, 2) apicid 3) core id and the task is to disable minimal number of cpus to make core id unique among those which are online. Of course it doesn't disable HT in any way, just removes certain logical cpus from scheduler.
