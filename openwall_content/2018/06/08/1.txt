This may lead to copying up to kernel heap pages to the userspace. See the PoC exploit attached.  This bug has been fixed in the upstream kernel already: and has been assigned to it.  The problem has limited scope, as users don't usually have permissions to access SCSI devices. On the other hand, e.g. the Nero user manual suggests doing `chmod o+r+w /dev/sg*` to make the devices accessible.  --  Alexander Potapenko Software Engineer  Google Germany GmbH Erika-Mann-Straße, 33 München  Geschäftsführer: Paul Manicle, Halimah DeLaine Prado Registergericht und -nummer: Hamburg, HRB Sitz der Gesellschaft: Hamburg  View attachment "sg_io_leak.c" of type "text/x-csrc" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
