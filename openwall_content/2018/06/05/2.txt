So when the filename gets concatenated to the target extraction directory, the final path ends up outside of the target folder.  Mitigation: users should upgrade to version users should upgrade to version users should upgrade to version  Apache Storm artifacts are available for immediate download here:   Apache Storm artifacts are available for immediate download here:   Credit: This issue was discovered by Snyk Security Research Team  References:  P.
