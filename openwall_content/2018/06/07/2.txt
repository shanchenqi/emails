Other versions may also by affected.  ====================================================================== 2) Severity  Rating: Less critical Impact: Denial of Service Where: Local Area Network  ====================================================================== 3) Description of Vulnerabilities  Secunia Research has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in Linux Kernel, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).  Multiple race condition errors when handling probe, disconnect, and rebind operations can be exploited to trigger a use-after-free condition or a NULL pointer dereference by sending multiple USB over IP packets.  Successful exploitation requires USB over IP daemon (usbipd) to be running.  The vulnerabilities are confirmed in versions and and reported in versions prior to prior to 4.9.x prior to and 4.4.x prior to Other versions may also by affected.  ====================================================================== 4) Solution  Update to version or  ====================================================================== 5) Time Table  - Linux Kernel team contacted with vulnerabilities details. - Linux Kernel team confirmed the vulnerabilities. - Release of an official patch. - Release of Secunia Advisory - Public disclosure of Secunia Research Advisory.  ====================================================================== 6) Credits  Jakub Jirasek, Secunia Research at Flexera.  ====================================================================== 7) References  The Flexera CNA has assigned identifier for the vulnerabilities through the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project.  ====================================================================== 8) About Flexera  Flexera helps application producers and enterprises increase application usage and the value they derive from their software.  http://www.flexera.com  Flexera delivers market-leading Software Vulnerability Management solutions enabling enterprises to proactively identify and remediate software vulnerabilities, effectively reducing the risk of costly security breaches.  https://www.flexera.com/enterprise/products/  Flexera supports and contributes to the community in several ways. We have always believed that reliable vulnerability intelligence and tools to aid identifying and fixing vulnerabilities should be freely available for consumers to ensure that users, who care about their online privacy and security, can stay secure. Only a few vendors address vulnerabilities in a proper way and help users get updated and stay secure. End-users (whether private individuals or businesses) are otherwise left largely alone, and that is why back in Secunia Research started investigating, coordinating disclosure and verifying software vulnerabilities. In Secunia Research became a part of Flexera and today our in-house software vulnerability research remains the core of the Software Vulnerability Management products at Flexera.  https://www.flexera.com/enterprise/company/about/secunia-research/  The public Secunia Advisory database contains information for researchers, security enthusiasts, and consumers to lookup individual products and vulnerabilities and assess, whether they need to take any actions to secure their systems or whether a given vulnerability has already been discovered  https://secuniaresearch.flexerasoftware.com/community/advisories/  ====================================================================== 9) Verification  Please verify this advisory by visiting the Secunia Research website:  ======================================================================    Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
