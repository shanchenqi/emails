The broker crashes due to the defect. AMQP protocols and 1.0 are not affected.  Resolution:  Users of Broker-J versions utilizing AMQP protocols 0-8, 0-9 or for message publishing must upgrade to version [2] or later.  Mitigation:  If upgrade of the broker is not possible, the maximum message size limit can be disabled by setting context variable "qpid.max_message_size" to "0" or any negative value. The change can be made either directly in the broker configuration file, or by using management interfaces (for example, REST API [3]) or by using JVM option -Dqpid.max_message_size=0. A broker restart is required for the change to take effect. Alternatively, the support for AMQP protocols can be removed on AMQP ports. The change can be made either directly in the broker configuration file or by using management interfaces. An example of REST API call restricting AMQP port to support only AMQP 1.0 and AMQP using curl utility is provided below:  curl --user <user-name> -X POST  -d \ https://<broker host>:<broker port>/api/latest/port/<port name>  Credit: This issue was found by the Qpid development team.
