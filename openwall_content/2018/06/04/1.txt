The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * AbsInt Astrée * Black Duck Detect * Black Duck Hub * CAS * Git * GitHub * GitHub Branch Source * GitHub Pull Request Builder * Kubernetes  Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  Various form validation methods in Git Plugin did not check the permission  of the user accessing them, allowing anyone with Overall/Read access to  Jenkins to cause Jenkins to send a GET request to a specified URL.  Additionally, these form validation methods did not require POST requests,  resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.   A form validation method in GitHub Plugin did not check the permission of  the user accessing it, allowing anyone with Overall/Read access to Jenkins  to cause Jenkins to send a POST request to a specified URL.  If that request’s HTTP response code indicates success, the form  validation is returning a generic success message, otherwise the HTTP  status code is returned.  Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests,  resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.   GitHub Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing  form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to  connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials  IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in  Jenkins.  Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests,  resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.   A form validation method in GitHub Branch Source Plugin did not check the  permission of the user accessing them, allowing anyone with Overall/Read  access to Jenkins to cause Jenkins to send a GET request to a specified URL.  Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests,  resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.   GitHub Pull Request Builder Plugin did not perform permission checks on  methods implementing form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read  access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker- specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing  credentials stored in Jenkins, and to cause Jenkins to submit HTTP  requests to attacker-specified URLs.  Additionally, these form validation methods did not require POST requests,  resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.   Kubernetes Plugin printed sensitive build variables, like passwords, to  the build log and master log, when using pipeline steps like withDockerRegistry.   A form validation method in GitHub Branch Source Plugin did not check the  permission of the user accessing them, allowing anyone with Overall/Read  access to Jenkins to cause Jenkins to send a GET request to a specified URL.  Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests,  resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.   AbsInt Astrée Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method  implementing form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access  to Jenkins to run a user-specified program on the Jenkins master.  Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests,  resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.   Black Duck Hub Plugin did not perform permission checks on methods  implementing form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access  to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker- specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing  credentials stored in Jenkins, and to cause Jenkins to submit HTTP  requests to attacker-specified URLs.   Additionally, these form validation methods did not require POST requests,  resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.   Black Duck Detect Plugin did not perform permission checks on methods  implementing form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access  to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker- specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing  credentials stored in Jenkins, and to cause Jenkins to submit HTTP  requests to attacker-specified URLs.   Additionally, these form validation methods did not require POST requests,  resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.
