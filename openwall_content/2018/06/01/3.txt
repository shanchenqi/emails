Description: Apache Ignite used library which did not suppress the class property, which allowed remote attackers to "manipulate" the ClassLoader and execute arbitrary code via the class parameter, as demonstrated by the passing of this parameter to the getClass method of the ActionForm object in Struts 1.  Mitigation: â˘    All Ignite versions: make sure there are no vulnerable classes among your custom code used in Apache Ignite. â˘    Upgrade to Apache Ignite 2.5 or later version  Credit: Harendra Rai of NCR Corporation discovered the impact of the existing vulnerability on Apache Ignite.
