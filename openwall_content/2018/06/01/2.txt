I honestly appreciate your security research and have been reading all of your advisories. Could you please tone it down in public mailing list read by hundreds of specialists who like lists SNR. Please directly contact author of the software with proof of concept or detailed explanation of the issue. Personal comments about skills etc are not helping anyone. If you need help coordinating this case feel free to contact me and I can reproduce the issue and report it to the developers. Maybe saving your time and possible frustration.  --  Henri Salo  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
