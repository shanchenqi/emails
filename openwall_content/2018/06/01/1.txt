Wrong again: ALL DLL spoofing vulnerabilities are known since more than 20 years. To write programs that still show it is a "bloody beginner's error".

Your incompetence and extraordinary manners deserve audience.  Let's start with the "blind command injection" of "rufus.com\r\n" your bug-riddled software attempts, and how it fails, MISERABLY!  JFTR: see       and       plus <https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/29.html>  1. open a command prompt, then run the following command lines:     SET NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath=*    <path>\rufus-3.0.exe     OUCH!     JFTR: this DOCUMENTED setting was introduced with Windows Vista,          more than 12 years ago: it's REALLY time for your homework,          kid!           2. open a command prompt, CD into a directory without "write file"    permission, for example a CD-ROM drive, and run the following    command line:     <path>\rufus-3.0.exe     OUCH!  3. open a command prompt, CD into a directory without "execute file"    permission, i.e. where your security conscious administrator    added the NTFS ACE "(D;OIIO;WP;;;WD)", and run the following    command line:     <path>\rufus-3.0.exe     OUCH!  4. ask your security conscious administrator to set the well-known    and well-documented policies (introduced with Windows Vista, more    than 12 years ago:        [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\RemovableStorageDevices]                                                 then open a command prompt, CD into a directory on a removable    volume, and run the following command line:     <path>\rufus-3.0.exe     OUCH!  5. open a command prompt, run the following command line, and    immediately switch the focus to an editor window (for example):     <path>\rufus-3.0.exe     OUCH!  That's what I call "bloody beginner's error". Or just EPIC FAIL!  stay tuned Stefan  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
