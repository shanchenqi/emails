For Debian this bug is tracked here:  >what about the second potential vulnerability: reading root's tty after  >the session is closed with something like tee(1) ?  The list of nasty things you can do when you get your hands on the tty  fd is probably very long...  >several sources suggest disabling TIOCSTI or using setsid(), are they  >enough?  setsid() defeats TIOCSTI (while breaking other things like job  control...); it doesn't stop other attacks that don't require  controlling terminal.  Until su is fixed to allocate new pty, I recommend running it under a  standalone terminal emulator, such as screen or tmux. This has also an  advantage that it's possible to tell that the invoked program actually  terminated, instead of just pretending to terminate and faking root  shell UI.  --  Jakub Wilk  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
