It was found that any gluster client authenticated via TLS could use gluster cli with --remote-host command to add itself to gluster trusted pool and perform all gluster operations like peer probe itself or other machines, start, stop, delete volumes etc.   Respectfully, Siddharth Sharma / Red Hat Product Security / Key ID :       Fingerprint  :  A49C E4CE CD6F D9F6   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
