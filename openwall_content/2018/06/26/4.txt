It could expose the content of files located outside the git-annex repository, or content from a private web server on localhost or the LAN. Joey Hess discovered this attack.  A malicious server for a special remote could trick git-annex into decrypting a file that was encrypted to the user's gpg key. This attack could be used to expose encrypted data that was never stored in git-annex. Daniel Dent discovered this attack in collaboration with Joey Hess.  git-annex version fixes these problems.   --  see shy jo  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
