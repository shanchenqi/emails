By the way, it might be the occasion to switch to more future-proof signatures, such as , which are reputed as quantum-safe and do not depend on some hardness assumptions. We could help with an open-source implem. if needed. Apparently, NIST is also moving into that direction for software signatures, according to information given now at ETSI's security week.
