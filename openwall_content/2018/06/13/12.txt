ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  x86 has a hardware mechanism for lazy FPU context switching.  On a task switch, %cr0.ts (Task Switched) gets set, and the next instruction to touch floating point state raises an #NM (No Math, later known as Device Not Available) exception.  Traditionally, FPU state has been large in comparison to available bandwidth (and therefore slow to switch) and not used as frequently as cpu tasks tend to switch.  This mechanism allows the OS to only switch FPU when necessary, which in turn increases performance.  Some CPUs however speculate past an #NM exception, allowing register content to be leaked by a side-channel.  For more details, see:    IMPACT ======  An attacker can read register state belonging to another vCPU previously scheduled on the same processor.  This can be state belonging a different guest, or state belonging to a different thread inside the same guest.  Furthermore, similar changes are expected for OS kernels.  Consult your operating system provider for more information.   VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Systems running all versions of Xen are affected.  Only x86 processors are vulnerable.  ARM processors are not known to be affected.  Only Intel Core based processors (from at least Nehalem onwards) are potentially affected.  Other processor designs (Intel Atom/Knights range), and other manufacturers (AMD) are not known to be affected.  MITIGATION ==========  Depending on the availability of host resources, leakage can be prevented between VMs by using cpupools or cpu pinning to isolate the vCPUs from different VMs to separate pCPUs.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Julian Stecklina (jsteckli@...zon.de) from Amazon and Thomas Prescher (thomas.prescher@...erus-technology.de) from Cyberus Technology.  It was also independenty discovered by Zdenek Sojka from SYSGO (http://sysgo.com) and by Colin Percival.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.       xen-unstable Xen  Xen 4.9.x, 4.8.x  Xen 4.7.x  Xen 4.6.x  Alternatively, the following patches can be used to create livepatches for running hypervisors.      xen-unstable, Xen 4.9.x Xen 4.8.x  $             $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.   (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
