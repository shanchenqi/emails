This allows remote code execution.  Code deployment should be restricted to users with DATA:MANAGE privilege.  Mitigation: Users of the affected versions should upgrade to Apache Geode or later.  Credit: This issue was reported responsibly to the Apache Geode Security Team by Dan Smith from Pivotal Software.
