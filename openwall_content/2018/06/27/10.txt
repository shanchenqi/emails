ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Certain PV MMU operations may take a long time to process.  For that reason Xen explicitly checks for the need to preempt the current vCPU at certain points.  A few rarely taken code paths did bypass such checks. By suitably enforcing the conditions through its own page table contents, a malicious guest may cause such bypasses to be used for an unbounded number of iterations.  IMPACT ======  A malicious or buggy PV guest may cause a Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host.  Specifically, it may prevent use of a physical CPU for an indeterminate period of time.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen versions from 3.4 onwards are vulnerable.  Xen versions 3.3 and earlier are vulnerable to an even wider class of attacks, due to them lacking preemption checks altogether in the affected code paths.  Only x86 systems are affected.  ARM systems are not affected.  Only multi-vCPU x86 PV guests can leverage the vulnerability.  x86 HVM or PVH guests as well as x86 single-vCPU PV ones cannot leverage the vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only HVM, PVH, or single-vCPU PV guests will avoid this vulnerability.  For PV guests, the vulnerability can be avoided if the guest kernel is controlled by the host rather than guest administrator, provided that further steps are taken to prevent the guest administrator from loading code into the kernel (e.g. by disabling loadable modules etc) or from using other mechanisms which allow them to run code at kernel privilege.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            xen-unstable      Xen ... 4.6.x  $   $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
