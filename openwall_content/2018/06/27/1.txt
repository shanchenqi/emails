Instead, users were advised to use the `yaml.safe_load()` API.  Starting with the PyYAML 4.1 release, the `yaml.load()` API has been made safe-by-default. Users wishing to opt into the old behavior and produce RCEs (or who trust their input) can use the `yaml.danger_load`.  Because of the degree to which this API presented a footgun, I would like to request a CVE for it.
