ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  One of the fixes in added some safety checks to help prevent Xen livelocking with debug exceptions.  Unfortunately, due to an oversight, at least one of these safety checks can be triggered by a guest.  IMPACT ======  A malicious PV guest can crash Xen, leading to a Denial of Service.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen systems which have applied the fix are vulnerable.  Only x86 systems are vulnerable.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.  Only x86 PV guests can exploit the vulnerability.  x86 HVM and PVH guests cannot exploit the vulnerability.  An attacker needs to be able to control hardware debugging facilities to exploit the vulnerability, but such permissions are typically available to unprivileged users.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only x86 HVM or PVH guests will avoid the vulnerability.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Andrew Cooper of Citrix.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            xen-unstable, Xen 4.9.x, 4.8.x       Xen 4.7.x, 4.6.x  $   $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
