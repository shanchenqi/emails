On the other hand, e.g. the Nero user manual > suggests doing `chmod o+r+w /dev/sg*` to make the devices accessible.  There is a check in the kernel in sg_build_indirect() exactly for this situation:          [drivers/scsi/sg.c]         if (!capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN) || !capable(CAP_SYS_RAWIO))                 gfp_mask |= __GFP_ZERO;  This means non-root user will get zero-ed pages even if it has o+rw access to /dev/sg*. Tests of your reproducer on systems available to me confirm this, i.e. non-root user gets a zero-ed out buffer even if it is able to access /dev/sg*.  I may not got smth correctly, but for now I do not see as a security flaw and I believe a reject request to MITRE should be issued.
