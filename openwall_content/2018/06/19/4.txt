When will the details be published so that OpenBSD users who buy Intel hardware can get more fined grained solutions against specific attack vectors ? Is it also scheduled for the 27th ?   Kind regards, //Logan C-x-C-c  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
