Perl module Email::Address, also in the last version is vulnerable to Algorithm Complexity problem and can cause Denial of Service when attacker prepares specially crafted input. Root of this problem is that parsing of email addresses in Email::Address module is done by regular expressions, which in perl can be exponential.  The trivial input is 30 form-fields characters. You can test it with following oneliner:  $ perl -MEmail::Address -E 'Email::Address->parse("\f" x 30)'  Vulnerable are all applications which receive (untrusted) emails and parse address headers (From/To/Cc/...) by Email::Address module. Such application can be DOSed by sending email with 30 form-fields characters in From or To header.  Note that this is not the only one problematic input, due to way how is Email::Address implemented it should be possible to prepare more non-trivial inputs.  This problem was already reported to Debian Security Team and they suggested to ask MITRE for assigning CVE identifier.
