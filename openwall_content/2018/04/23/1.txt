It's an authorization bypass which works since version from (current is because PLA uses '==' instead of '===' for the password comparison in 'attemptGrant' of the 'Authorization' class. If the password is set to one which correspondends to a number in scientific notation, one could easier bruteforce the password or bypass it completely, e.g.:  php > == '2e2'); bool(true) php > var_dump('0' == '0e2'); bool(true) php > var_dump('0' == bool(true)  I opened an issue at GitHub for this[0] and have written about it[1] (section 2 is the interesting one for this issue).
