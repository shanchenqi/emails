Created a CFI cluster with RAP and Clang CFI inside.  Well, naming can get confusing here. RAP got renamed along the way to include both "Return Address Protection" (backward edge) and "Indirect Control Transfer Protection" (forward edge). Clang CFI is forward edge only, though things like shadow stacks or pointer authentication can provide backward edge protection. So... I'm not sure how much detail you want to capture in the bubbles. :)  > However, I didn't manage to find any materials about applying Clang CFI to the > Linux kernel.  Here's Sami Tolvanen's work on doing Clang CFI (on top of Clang LTO): https://android-review.googlesource.com/q/topic:android-4.9-cfi  -Kees  --  Kees Cook Pixel Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
