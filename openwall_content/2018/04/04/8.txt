This is because FTP client code in HPL/SQL does not verify the destination location of the downloaded file. This does not affect hive cli user and hiveserver2 user as hplsql is a separate command line script and needs to be invoked differently.  Mitigation: User who use HPL/SQL with Hive through should upgrade to which removes support for "COPY FROM FTP". Alternatively, the usage of HPL/SQL can be disabled through other means.
