Mitigation: Users who use xpath UDFs in HiveServer2 and hive.server2.enable.doAs=false are recommended to upgrade to or update UDFXPathUtil.java to the head of branch-2.3 and rebuild hive-exec.jar: If these functions are not being used at present, you can also disable its use by adding them to the value of the config hive.server2.builtin.udf.blacklist.
