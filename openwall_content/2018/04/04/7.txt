Mitigation: It is recommended to upgrade prior version of Hive JDBC driver to Note Hive JDBC driver is not backward compatible with HiveServer2, which means newer version of Hive JDBC driver may not talk to older version of HiveServer2. In particular, Hive JDBC driver won't talk to HiveServer2 or prior. If user is using Hive code or below they might need to upgrade all the Hive instances to   Alternative to the upgrade, is to take the follow two actions in your Hive JDBC client code/application when dealing with user provided input in PreparedStatement: 1. Avoid passing user input PreparedStatement.setBinaryStream 2. Sanitize the user input for PreparedStatement.setString, by replacing all occurrences of \' to '  Credit: This issue was discovered by Bear Giles of SnapLogic  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
