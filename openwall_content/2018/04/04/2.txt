It would be nice to have some graphical representation of its current state. So I've created a Linux Kernel Defence Map showing the relations between:  - vulnerability classes / exploitation techniques,  - kernel defences,  - bug detection means.  Link:     N.B. The node connections don't mean "full mitigation". These connections represent some kind of relation. So ideally, this map should help to navigate in documentation and Linux kernel sources.  I wrote it in DOT language and generated the picture using GraphViz. So it is very pleasant to maintain this map with git.  I would be grateful for any feedback.
