There are many nuances, details, and caveats for a lot of the defense details, but I do like showing the general relationships. Having some much longer accompanying text would be nice to dive more deeply into each bubble in the chart. I'd like to capture as much of that as possible in upstream's Documentation/security/self-protection.rst! :)  Some initial thoughts in looking at the chart:   Upstream's SLAB_FREELIST_HARDENED is based on an "unnamed" (always-on) grsecurity defense (see commit so that should have a dashed line, but I'm not sure how to name the new bubble.  KPTI defends against info leaks and "finding kernel objects" too, in a way. Maybe just add a whole "side channels" bubble?  (I think "info leaks" and "finding kernel objects" may need some kind of clarifying language for how they're different)  I didn't immediately parse that "Pointer Obfuscation" meant the %p hashing, but I don't have a good suggestion about how to improve that language. :)  Upstream's /proc/sys/net/core/bpf_jit_harden (see commit and other JIT features (RO-setting, randomized offset, etc) are designed to defend against JIT Abuse.  UDEREF and SMAP pointing at ret2usr+ROP is fine, but seems "incomplete". Is there a good name for "reading user memory and operating on a malicious structure"? It's a more narrow exploit technique than ROP or executing userspace memory, but it's important to cover.  I'd expect UDEREF to point at ret2usr, too.  Maybe add CPU_SW_DOMAIN_PAN and to point at both ret2usr and the new "access userspace" bubble?   -Kees  --  Kees Cook Pixel Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
