Affected versions:  Squid ->                     Squid ->                     Squid 3.3 -> Fixed in version:   Squid __________________________________________________________________          __________________________________________________________________  Problem Description:   Due to incorrect pointer handling Squid is vulnerable to denial  of service attack when processing ESI responses.  __________________________________________________________________  Severity:   This problem allows a remote server delivering ESI responses  to trigger a denial of service for all clients accessing the  Squid service.   This problem is limited to Squid operating as reverse proxy.  __________________________________________________________________  Updated Packages:   This bug is fixed by Squid version   In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable  releases can be found in our patch archives:  Squid 3.5:    If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer  to the package vendor for availability information on updated  packages.  __________________________________________________________________  Determining if your version is vulnerable:   All Squid-2.x and older are not vulnerable.   All Squid-3.0 and older version are not vulnerable.   All Squid built with --disable-esi are not vulnerable.   All Squid-3.x versions up to and including built with  --disable-ssl are not vulnerable.   All Squid-3.x versions up to and including built without  --enable-ssl are not vulnerable.   All Squid-3.x versions up to and including built without  --enable-esi are not vulnerable.   All and later versions up to and including  built with --enable-esi and--enable-ssl, and being  used for reverse-proxy are vulnerable.   All and later versions up to and including  built with --enable-esi and --enable-ssl, and being  used for reverse-proxy are vulnerable.   All Squid-3.3 and later versions up to and including  built with --enable-esi and --enable-ssl, and being  used for reverse-proxy are vulnerable.   All Squid-3.4 and later versions up to and including  built with --enable-esi and --enable-ssl, and being  used for reverse-proxy are vulnerable.   All Squid-3.5 versions up to and including built without  --with-openssl are not vulnerable.   All Squid-3.5 and later versions up to and including built  with --enable-esi and --with-openssl, and being used for  reverse-proxy are vulnerable.   All Squid-4 versions up to and including built without  --with-openssl are not vulnerable.   All Squid-4 versions up to and including built with  --with-openssl and being used for reverse-proxy are vulnerable.  __________________________________________________________________  Workarounds:  Either;   Build Squid with --disable-esi  Or,   Build Squid-3.1 to or later with "--disable-ssl"  Or,   Build Squid-3.5 or later with "--without-openssl"  __________________________________________________________________  Contact details for the Squid project:   For installation / upgrade support on binary packaged versions  of Squid: Your first point of contact should be your binary  package vendor.   If your install and build Squid from the original Squid sources  then the squid-users@...ts.squid-cache.org mailing list is your  primary support point. For subscription details see  <http://www.squid-cache.org/Support/mailing-lists.html>.   For reporting of non-security bugs in the latest STABLE release  the squid bugzilla database should be used  <http://bugs.squid-cache.org/>.   For reporting of security sensitive bugs send an email to the  squid-bugs@...ts.squid-cache.org mailing list. It's a closed  list (though anyone can post) and security related bug reports  are treated in confidence until the impact has been established.  __________________________________________________________________  Credits:   This vulnerability was discovered by Michael Marshall of Trend  Micro working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
