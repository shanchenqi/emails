There is indeed a double free of console_device, if a SIGINT is caught right before main() returns. (Looking at git dbf0b4). Besides the easter egg, the patch is still wrong. optarg may be reused via console_device, so the strdup() is OK, but the ressource-free and signal handling isnt.  Shouts to the beep trolls. I strongly challenge the oppinion that security is better done without it ...
