I question whether beep should be saved. It would require someone carefully reviewing the code and effectively become the new upstream. And all that for a tool talking to the PC speaker, which doesn't exist in most modern systems anyway. Instead distros should consider not installing it as suid or just killing the package altogether. I heard some distros (suse) replace beep with a simple "printf '\a'" which seems also a safe solution. (although it obviously kills all frequency/length/etc features of original "beep").  --  Hanno Bรถck https://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
