The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * Email Extension * Google Login * HTML Publisher * S3 Publisher  Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you find security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  Google Login Plugin did not invalidate the previous session and create a  new one upon successful login, allowing attackers able to control or  obtain another userâs pre-login session ID to impersonate them.   Google Login Plugin redirected users to an arbitrary URL specified as a  query parameter after successful login, enabling phishing attacks.   Email Extension Plugin stores an SMTP password in the global Jenkins  configuration.  While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in  plain text as part of the configuration form. This could result in  exposure of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting  vulnerabilities, and similar situations.   S3 Publisher Plugin did not properly escape file names shown on the Jenkins UI. This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by users able to control the names of uploaded files.   HTML Publisher Plugin allows specifying a name for the HTML reports it  publishes. This report name was used in the URL of the report and as a  directory name on the Jenkins master without further processing, resulting  in a path traversal vulnerability that allowed overriding files outside  the intended directory.
