If someone pastes a CR/LF into a shell  >prompt, it certainly *DOES* cause an action,  Similarly, tab is an "active" character in most shells.  In the worst case (the victim uses bash with bash-completion installed,  and the attacker has write access to the victim's filesystem), pasting  tab can be as bad as pasting LF.
