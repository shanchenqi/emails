One reason I asked because for some people knee-jerk reaction upon  learning about this issue is to insist that the browser should only copy  what the user sees. Cleverly, they never elaborate what that means  exactly.  Is a "font-size: 3pt" text visible? Should the browser consult the  user's eye exam results before deciding what to copy?  Does it mean Ctrl+A Ctrl+C would copy only text within the viewport? I  guess so, but that's not what browser users expect.  And in the PDF world: the user is often shown a scan, and there's a  hidden copyable text layer. Should the PDF browser somehow refuse to  copy text with recognition errors?  >>If you're going to break some basic mechanic of human computer  >>interaction, >Huh? Most users don't interact with their terminal-based software by  >pasting control characters.  As it was noted elsewhere in this thread, tabs and newlines are control  characters, too. People paste them all the time. But I don't think  anyone is seriously proposing to filter out these two.  --  Jakub Wilk  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
