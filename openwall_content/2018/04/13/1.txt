Not at all!  My point is that we should be careful about terminology. "Control characters" already has a well-known standard definition, using the same term for a different set is confusing & could lead to misimplementation. Just call them something else that doesn't already have a standard definition ("dangerous bytes" or whatever).  --- David A.
