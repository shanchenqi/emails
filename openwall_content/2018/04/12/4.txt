There are some typos in the previous post.  Here is the corrected message:  ## Security Advisory  nghttp2: Denial of service due to NULL pointer dereference.  ### Vulnerability  If ALTSVC frame is received by libnghttp2 and it is larger than it can accept, the pointer field which points to ALTSVC frame payload is left NULL.  Later libnghttp2 attempts to access another field through the pointer, and gets segmentation fault.  ALTSVC frame is defined by RFC  The largest frame size libnghttp2 accept is by default bytes.  Receiving ALTSVC frame is disabled by default.  Application has to enable it explicitly by calling `nghttp2_option_set_builtin_recv_extension_type(opt, NGHTTP2_ALTSVC)`.  Transmission of ALTSVC is always enabled, and it does not cause this vulnerability.  ALTSVC frame is expected to be sent by server, and received by client as defined in RFC  Client and server are both affected by this vulnerability if the reception of ALTSVC frame is enabled.  As written earlier, it is useless to enable reception of ALTSVC frame on server side.  So, server is generally safe unless application accidentally enabled the reception of ALTSVC frame.  ### Affected Versions  * Affected versions: nghttp2 >= and nghttp2 <= * Not affected versions: nghttp2 >=  ### The Solution  Upgrade to nghttp2  If the upgrade cannot be possible:  For client, disable ALTSVC, removing the call to `nghttp2_option_set_builtin_recv_extension_type(opt, NGHTTP2_ALTSVC)`  For server, because it is never expected to receive ALTSVC, just remove `nghttp2_option_set_builtin_recv_extension_type(opt, NGHTTP2_ALTSVC)`.  ### Time Line  It was first reported to the nghttp2 team April 4  nghttp2 was released on April 12  ### Credits  Reported by Jordan Zebor at F5 Networks, and James M Snell from Node.js project.  Fixed by the nghttp2 team.  Thank you for all who involved.  This security advisory format is inspired from curl/libcurl project.
