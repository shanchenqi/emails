Is DEL one (ASCII >  The term "control character" has a standard definition for every encoding I'm familiar with.  ASCII defined a set of control characters, and Unicode built on them.  The Unicode list of control characters is here: https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/category/Cc/list.htm You'll see it includes: 	BELL 	BACKSPACE 	CHARACTER TABULATION 	LINE FEED (LF) 	FORM FEED (FF) (aka ^L) 	CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) 	DELETE  According to Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII>, the set of control characters in US-ASCII is and 7F (hex).

Similarly, TAB wouldn't be a > control character in that definition.  As you noted, that definition doesn't match the ASCII definition, but I also think it's misleading.  If someone pastes a CR/LF into a shell prompt, it certainly *DOES* cause an action, namely, execution of that line. That's probably not what you meant by "action", but from a security point-of-view, causing a script to execute is rather important :-).  --- David A.
