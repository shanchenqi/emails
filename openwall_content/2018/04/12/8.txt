That unfortunately means that the specification one wants is to deny pasting control messages except for a particular set (since you're certainly not going to want to stop pasting of a newline sequence, and probably not pasting of tabs), and then you have to find the right way to define that set of characters that you want to allow.  I have some "I know it when I see it" definition in my head, but it's hard to be precise without listing out the specific characters that I would allow and that I would disallow (at least as interpreted commands).  --  Russ Allbery (eagle@...ie.org)              <http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/>  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
