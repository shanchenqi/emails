I hope you're not proposing that, to protect users of terminal emulators, general-purpose web browsers should not allow copying more than a paragraph at a time? That seems like a change that is unlikely to be accepted.  Similarly, if filtering of pastes is done at the destination side (the terminal emulator), it would seem bad to be unable to paste more than a line at a time into a text editor that happens to be running in a terminal emulator (for instance the one in which I'm writing this email).  Russ's more loose definition of "control character" (in particular, preventing copying and/or pasting ESC and the range) would be enough to protect users of a terminal/shell combination that supports bracketed paste, as far as I'm aware?      smcv  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
