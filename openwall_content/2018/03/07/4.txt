Given that the documentation claims the examples are of "A production-ready setup where all communication is encrypted."[2], I plan to request a CVE id.  The details:  The example nginx configuration is based on running nginx as a reverse-proxy of portus and (docker) registry. The docker-compose provided along the nginx config sets up a certificate[3] for both components (first smell: only one certificate).  The one an only certificate is also configured on the reverse proxy, and a decent ciphers list among other security-related http headers are setup.  But there's no single proxy_ssl_* directive in the whole nginx configuration (second smell). Meaning that proxy_ssl_verify is off (nginx default).  Has anyone reviewed portus? this is the second missing certificate verification I noticed.  CC'ing the SUSE security team.  Oh and it appears that this one comes from the Portus-On-OracleLinux7[4] repo from which "[they] borrowed a lot of the NGinx configuration"[2] :  CC'ing Avi Miller.
