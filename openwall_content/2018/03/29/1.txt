An attacker with privileged access could exploit this by mounting a crafted ext4 image to cause a kernel panic.  References:  =====  kernel: Out of bounds read in ext4/balloc.c:ext4_valid_block_bitmap() causes crash with crafted ext4 image  The Linux kernel through version is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read in ext4/balloc.c:ext4_valid_block_bitmap() function. An privileged attacker could exploit this by mounting a crafted ext4 image to cause a crash.  References:  =====  kernel: NULL pointer dereference in ext4/xattr.c:ext4_xattr_inode_hash() causes crash with crafted ext4 image  The Linux kernel through version is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference in the ext4/xattr.c:ext4_xattr_inode_hash() function. A privileged attacker could exploit this to cause a NULL pointer dereference with a crafted ext4 image.  References:  =====  kernel: NULL pointer dereference in fs/posix_acl.c:get_acl() causes crash with crafted ext4 image  The Linux kernel through version is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference in the  fs/posix_acl.c:get_acl()function. A privileged attacker could exploit this to cause a NULL pointer dereference with a crafted ext4 image.
