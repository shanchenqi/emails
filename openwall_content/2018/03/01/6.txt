ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Grant tables come in two flavors (versions), and domains are permitted to freely change between them (subject to certain constraints).  For the guest to use the facility, both the "normal" shared pages (applicable to v1 and v2) and the "status" pages (applicable to v2 only) need to be mapped by the guest into its address space.  When transitioning from v2 to v1, the status pages become unnecessary and are therefore freed by Xen.  That means Xen needs to check that there are no mappings of those pages by the domain.  However, that check was mistakenly implemented as a bug check, rather than returning an error to the guest.  IMPACT ======  A malicious or buggy guest may cause a hypervisor crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host.  Privilege escalation as well as information leaks cannot be ruled out for HVM, PVH (both x86), and ARM guests.  The impact is more severe for Xen versions 4.0.x, ... and 4.2 in that the pages are freed without any checking, thus allowing their re-use for another domain, or by Xen itself, while there still are active mappings (see XSA-26).  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen versions 4.0 and newer are vulnerable.  Both x86 and ARM systems are vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  Using the "gnttab=max_ver:1" hypervisor command line option, where available, to disable use of v2 grant tables allows to avoid the vulnerability.  Use of this option will, however, break any guests which require to make use of v2 functionality.  The patch introducing this option was not merged so far, but is available (in its current form) at ("common/gnttab: Introduce command line feature controls").  There is no other known mitigation.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.          xen-unstable, Xen     Xen 4.9.x, Xen 4.8.x     Xen 4.7.x     Xen 4.6.x  $         $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  However, deployment of the mitigation is NOT permitted (except where all the affected systems and VMs are administered and used only by organisations which are members of the Xen Project Security Issues Predisclosure List).  Specifically, deployment on public cloud systems is NOT permitted.  This is because this produces a guest-visible change which will indicate which component contains the vulnerability.  Additionally, distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
