The bug allows for a denial of service attack in applications that allow DTD processing and do not prevent external DTD usage, and could conceivably result in remote code execution.  Mitigation: Applications that are using library versions older than should upgrade as soon as possible. Distributors of older versions should apply the patch from this subversion revision:   Applications should strongly consider blocking remote entity resolution and/or outright disabling of DTD processing in light of the continued identification of bugs in this area of the library.
