For a lot of things like encryption and denial of service the line in the sand is somewhat arbitrary. For example a traffic amplification attack that is 1:1 is probably not going to get a CVE today, but for example a traffic amplification (so 1 megabit/sec turns into ~= 50 gigabits/second) is clearly a problem, especially if it's via UDP which can 1) be spoofed and 2) can result in the remote end just firing the traffic off blindly.  I am told this memcached attack is causing traffic reflection well past 1:5 (an arbitrary line I've drawn in the sand, 1:2 isn't enough to really worry about with some exceptions, and is clearly a problem, so because of how many fingers we mostly have, 1:5 seems fair), in fact this attack is seeing amplification by several orders of magnitude past 1:5. Also memached has fixed this in release by disabling UDP by default (one metric for CVE is "can this be fixed", if yes that's a good sign we didn't want the previous behavior).  I have assigned to this issue:  Memcached version contains an Insufficient Control of Network Message Volume (Network Amplification, vulnerability in the UDP support of the memcached server that can result in denial of service via network flood (traffic amplification of has been reported by reliable sources). This attack appear to be exploitable via network connectivity to port UDP. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in due to the disabling of the UDP protocol by default.
