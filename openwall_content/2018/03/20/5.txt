OpenSSL does not treat this as a security vulnerability. This is a heads-up to developers who rely on the affected code so they can review the impact on their applications on a case-by-case basis.  The bug is located in a function written in assembly language and the bug can only manifest on specific processors, most likely the same as (see https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html):  "This only affects processors that support the AVX2 but not ADX extensions like Intel Haswell (4th generation)"  As far as I know BoringSSL and LibreSSL are not affected.  You can use the PoC below the line to see if your system is affected.  A system that is affected:  $ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "avx2\|adx" -o | sort -u avx2 $ ./a.out result is 0 result is  A system that is not affected:  $ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "avx2\|adx" -o | sort -u adx avx2 $ ./a.out result is 0 result is 0  -------------------  #include <openssl/bn.h>  static void do_mod_exp(int consttime) {     BIGNUM *res, *A = NULL, *B = NULL, *C = NULL;     BN_CTX *ctx = BN_CTX_new();     char* bn_str = NULL;      res = BN_new();     BN_dec2bn(&A,     BN_dec2bn(&B,     BN_dec2bn(&C,      if ( consttime ) {         BN_set_flags(A, BN_FLG_CONSTTIME);     }     BN_mod_exp(res, A, B, C, ctx);     bn_str = BN_bn2dec(res);     printf("result is %s\n", bn_str);     OPENSSL_free(bn_str);     BN_CTX_free(ctx);     BN_free(A);     BN_free(B);     BN_free(C); }  int main(void) {     do_mod_exp(0);     do_mod_exp(1);     return 0; }  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
