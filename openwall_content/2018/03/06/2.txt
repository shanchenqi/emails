NOTE: This notification was sent to "distros" mailing list on  has some more information about this flaw, including a patch.  -------------  remote Denial of Service (DoS) via search filters in  SetUnicodeStringFromUTF_8 in collate.c  A flaw was found in Directory Server that affects all versions. An improper handling of the search feature with an extended filter, when read access on <attribute_name> is enabled, in SetUnicodeStringFromUTF_8 function in collate.c, can lead to out-of-bounds memory operations. This may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to trigger a server crash, thus resulting in denial of service.
