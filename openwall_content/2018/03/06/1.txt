Gday,  Dan Aloni reported to Red Hat that there was a flaw in the CIFS client implementation in kernel that could cause a null pointer dereference and panic the a Linux CIFS client.  It would require the server to implement the CIFS protocol incorrectly or momentarily impersonate the CIFS server during session recovery (such as when the server was shut down, or the network conditions were bad). The attacker would need to return an empty "TargetInfo" in the NTLMSSP setup negotiation response causing the null pointer dereference when interpreted by the client.   Report ( and patch )    RedHat Bugzilla:   Thanks,  Wade Mealing Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
