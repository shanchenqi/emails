Interesting -- could you confirm that the effect of this bug is a miscalculation? Or is it breaking the constant-time assertion?  > OpenSSL does not treat this as a security vulnerability.

Do you consider it a security vulnerability? Can you give advice to developers of how to mitigate this kind of issue?  Is it regarded a WONTFIX by OpenSSL or is it going to be fixed (just not treated as security-criticial)? If so, do you know the fix version?
