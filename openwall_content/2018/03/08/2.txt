(Just reading the protocol specs)  The default maximum size of an item is 1M, but you can easily request more than one item using the gets command.    gets <key>*\r\n where <key>* is one or several keys separated by whitespace. A key is a text string that must not include control characters or whitespace. The maximum length of a key is characters but I don't think there's a minimum size so one byte keys should be fine.  /Patrick > > On AM, "Tomas Hoger" <thoger@...hat.com> wrote: > >     On Fri, 2 Mar Kurt Seifried wrote: >      >     > I have assigned to this issue: >     >  >     > Memcached version contains an Insufficient Control of Network >     > Message Volume (Network Amplification, vulnerability in the >     > UDP support of the memcached server that can result in denial of >     > service via network flood (traffic amplification of has been >     > reported by reliable sources).
