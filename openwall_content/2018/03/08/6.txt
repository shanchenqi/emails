As we learned today the entry point of the hack likely happened via the e-learning software Ilias. It's an opensource PHP-based software: https://www.ilias.de/  We had an article about this today on Golem.de and we also created an English translation:  While we don't know what exactly happened, Ilias itself seems to have had quite a few vulnerabilties in the past:  Arbitrary copying of files  Cross Site Scripting in SVG import  Cross Site Scripting due to lack of escaping  System emails sometimes get delivered to the wrong people  Vulnerability in handling of media files with unknown impact  Reflected cross site scripting   Appart from all that the software by default creates an administrator account with the default username "root" and password "homer". The user is neither forced nor asked to change these. (Opinions here may differ, but in my opinion default credentials are a design vulnerability on their own.)  If you happen to run Ilias please update to the latest version and make sure that you have changed the password for the "root" account.  --  Hanno Bรถck https://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
