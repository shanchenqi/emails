(5 bytes) get a = 1MB  (7 bytes) get a a = 2MB  bytes) get a a âŚ =  When doing the initial write-up I forgot to include the magic bytes, so the actual payload is a few bytes larger than bytes but the query itself is bytes, this is a mistake on my part while preparing the write-up.    We also did some testing against a memcached install to see how far we could chain/repeat keys in a single request and the cut-off was right around response using a 1MB loaded value with single character key.

(Just reading the protocol     specs)          The default maximum size of an item is 1M, but you can easily request     more than one item using the gets command.        gets <key>*\r\n     where <key>* is one or several keys separated by whitespace.     A key is a text string that must not include control characters or     whitespace. The maximum length of a key is characters but I don't     think there's a minimum size so one byte keys should be fine.          /Patrick     >     > On AM, "Tomas Hoger" <thoger@...hat.com> wrote:     >     >     On Fri, 2 Mar Kurt Seifried wrote:     >          >     > I have assigned to this issue:     >     >      >     > Memcached version contains an Insufficient Control of Network     >     > Message Volume (Network Amplification, vulnerability in the     >     > UDP support of the memcached server that can result in denial of     >     > service via network flood (traffic amplification of has been     >     > reported by reliable sources).
