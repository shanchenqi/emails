This reply is mainly for this other purpose: It looks you wanted to have a CVE assigned trough this reply to the list. CVE's cannot anymore be requested via the oss-security list. If you want to request one please have a look at https://cveform.mitre.org/  Once you have the CVE assigned, can you please loop back the assignement in this thread?
