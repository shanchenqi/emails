Upstream memcached reacted by disabling the UDP-based protocol by default: This is good, however one could argue that they should also default to localhost only.   Most distros I checked right now default to enabling UDP, but restricting connections to While this is not directly vulnerable it's only a minor change away from being so. The memcached announcement sounds like the UDP protocol is rarely used and should be considered deprecated and replaced by the TCP-based one.  I recommend all distributions consider changing their defaults to disabling the UDP-based memcached protocol by default.  --  Hanno Bรถck https://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
