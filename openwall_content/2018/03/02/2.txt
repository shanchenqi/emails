While it is not yet CVE worthy I can see the bar moving (much like it has for default passwords, and crypto) in the near future as this is clearly becoming a problem. Please note that this problem is already covered by (to some degree) which makes the case for CVE assignment stronger.   > -- > Hanno Bรถck > https://hboeck.de/ > > mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de > GPG: >    --   Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
