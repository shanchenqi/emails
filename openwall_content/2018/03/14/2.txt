The function `ldap_get_attribute_ber()` is called to get attributes, but it turns out that it can return `LDAP_SUCCESS` and still return a `NULL` pointer in the result pointer when getting a particularly crafted response. This was a surprise to us and to the code.  libcurl-using applications that allow LDAP URLs, or that allow redirects to LDAP URLs could be made to crash by a malicious server.  We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.  INFO ----  The bug is only present in curl versions built to use OpenLDAP.  This bug was introduced in May in [this  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name to this issue.  NULL Pointer Dereference  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  - Affected versions: curl to and including curl - Not affected versions: curl < and curl >=  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such.  THE SOLUTION ------------  In curl version curl checks the pointer properly before using it.  A [patch for is available.  RECOMMENDATIONS ---------------  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:    A - Upgrade curl to version    B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild    C - Make sure you disable LDAP in your transfers  TIME LINE ---------  It was reported to the curl project on March 6,  We contacted distros@...nwall on March 7,  curl was released on March 14 coordinated with the publication of this advisory.  CREDITS -------  Reported by Dario Weisser. Patch by Daniel Stenberg.
