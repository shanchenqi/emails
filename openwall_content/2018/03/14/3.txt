When asked to transfer an RTSP URL, curl could calculate a wrong data length to copy from the read buffer. The memcpy call would copy data from the heap following the buffer to a storage area that would subsequently be delivered to the application (if it didn't cause a crash). We've managed to get it to reach several hundreds bytes out of range.  This could lead to information leakage or a denial of service for the application if the server offering the RTSP data can trigger this.  We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.  INFO ----  This bug was introduced in January in [this when RTSP support was first added.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name to this issue.  Buffer Over-read  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  - Affected versions: curl to and including curl - Not affected versions: curl < and curl >=  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such.  THE SOLUTION ------------  In curl version curl makes sure that this code never gets told to copy more data than it is allowed to read from the buffer.  A [patch for is available.  RECOMMENDATIONS ---------------  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:    A - Upgrade curl to version    B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild  TIME LINE ---------  It was reported to the curl project on February 20,  We contacted distros@...nwall on March 8,  curl was released on March 14 coordinated with the publication of this advisory.  CREDITS -------  Detected by OSS-fuzz. Assisted by Max Dymond. Patch by Daniel Stenberg.
