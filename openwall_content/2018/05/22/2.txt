Or they can alter the displayed content of a signed message with a colliding cid: URL, assuming the ones generated by the original client are not unpredictable (and you might actually have many tries within the same crafted message).  There could also be some automated exfiltration angles, but those probably rely on client HTML rendering bugs, so they don't really count.
