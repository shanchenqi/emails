If the Derby Network Server is not running with a Java Security Manager policy file, the attack is successful. If the server is using a policy file, the policy file must permit the database location to be read for the attack to work. The default Derby Network Server policy file distributed with the affected releases includes a permissive policy as the default Network Server policy, which allows the attack to work.  Mitigation: Users should specify an explicit security policy file, as described here:  Derby release disallows the specially-crafted network packet, and also modifies the default Derby Network Server policy file to be significantly less permissive (the default file access policy is now limited to the derby.system.home directory and the directory from which the Derby jar files were loaded). It is still recommended that production installations of the Derby Network Server should specify an explicit security policy file.
