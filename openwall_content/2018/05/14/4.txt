Some sources such as:   indicate that the fix is the change to the default security policy, i.e.  However, the wording above seems to consider that as more of an additional hardening fix, and the actual security fix is change to handling of the ping command to disallow additional arguments, i.e.  Related to the above is the question regarding the list of affected versions.  Version is listed as the first affected, however the "ping with arguments" should pre-date that version, and even indicates it's old code.  However, seems to be the first version to include the default security policy, which may be the reason why it's listed as the first affected.  And one more clarification for those of us not familiar with Derby: What is the known impact of opening some untrusted database?  Is it known to e.g. allow arbitrary code execution directly in Derby?
