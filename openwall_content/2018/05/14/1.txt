Debian Security team didn't get any private information yet, but there have been multiple twitter threads and blog posts published already:  bugs-can-reveal-encrypted-e-mails-uninstall-now/ require-you-take-action-now  GnuPG has posted a tweet indicating it's likely a vulnerability in mail clients themselves and not in the protocol, and which is related to HTML mail handling.  The vulnerabilities apparently enable an attacker to decrypt previous mails, but my (wild) guess is that the attack actually requests decryption from the mail client (which has access to the private key), rather than by actually decrypting itself.
