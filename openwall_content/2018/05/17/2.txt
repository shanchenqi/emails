These releases also fix a denial of service vulnerability. Users are encouraged to update.  # Apache ORC denial of service vulnerability  ## Severity:  Medium  ## Vendor:  [The Apache Software Foundation](https://apache.org)  ## Versions Affected:  * ORC to  ## Description:  A malformed ORC file can trigger an endlessly recursive function call in the C++ or Java parser.  The impact of this bug is most likely denial-of-service against software that uses the ORC file parser. With the C++ parser, the stack overflow might possibly corrupt the stack.  ## Mitigation:  * 1.3.x and 1.4.x users should upgrade to * 1.0.x to 1.2.x users should apply (Java) and (C++).  ## Example:  An ORC file with a struct, union, array, or map type that includes itself as a child will cause the parser to infinitely recurse until the stack overflows.  ## Credit:  This issue was discovered by Terry Chia.  ## References: [Apache ORC security](https://orc.apache.org/security/)   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
