I presume what Florian is asking about is Content-ID links [0]. One purpose of CID links is to include images as a message part and then reference them from the HTML email content. I would think a CID URL would not be immediately vulnerable to the “direct exfiltration” attack because it shouldn’t result in a network fetch; just a lookup locally. However, RFC requires the IDs to be “globally unique” and some mail clients (e.g. iOS Mail) take the RFC at its word and render images from CID URLs that reference content included in entirely distinct emails in your mailbox. Perhaps the attacker can hide their payload within a message part with the chosen ID included in another email.  I haven’t fully thought through whether this is feasible, but this is a fairly convoluted vector that an attacker has no reason to use if they have available the attack described on the efail site. Closing exploitation of the original attack looks like it would cut off this hypothetical indirect attack too.
