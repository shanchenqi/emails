Have a look at some official statements on this:  * * https://protonmail.com/blog/pgp-vulnerability-efail/  For the case of PGP it sounds like the only problems occur when mail clients ignore the GPG hints.  For S/MIME, it does sound like the standard is broken and needs fixing.  If I understand this correctly, the "Direct Exfiltration" is an attack that doesn't require modifying the encrypted data - so presumably the MDC in PGP won't help. To me this sounds like a email client problem (allowing mixing encrypted and encrypted data in the one HTML document seems like a very bad idea), but the https://efail.de/ page says the standards need to be updated to fix this. --  Brian May <brian@...uxpenguins.xyz> https://linuxpenguins.xyz/brian/  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
