Attackers can SQL inject the component's database(SQLite) without authenticating to the controller or SDNInterfaceapp.  The bug can be found in /impl/src/main/java/org/opendaylight/sdninterfaceapp/impl/database/SdniDataBase.java (line  The SDNI concats port information to build an insert SQL query, and it executes the query in SQLite.  However, in line the portName is a string that can be customized by switches. Since SQLite supports multiple sql queries in one run, attackers can customize the port name to inject another SQL if they compromise or forge a switch.  For example, set portName as: ");drop table NAME;//  Recommended Actions -------------------  The SDNI project is no longer maintained nor developed since the Carbon release of OpenDayLight and as the aforementioned vulnerability was reported after Carbons last service release (SR4) was shipped, the decision was made to not release a patch.  The security team instead recommends that users upgrade to a later release.
