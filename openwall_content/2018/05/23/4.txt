Yeah I know, not super helpful.  In general when I look at something and need to decide whether or not it deserves/needs a CVE the fundamentals are:  1) Can an attacker use this vulnerability to gain access, additional privileges, basically is there an impact to Confidentiality/Availability/Integrity? This is really two tests: is there an impact, and is there a way for the attacker to trigger or exploit it? That's a CVE.  2) Does the software/system make a specific security claim that they then fail to meet? E.g. "we include a firewall that blocks access to everything inbound except for port 22", if they were to then also allow port 80, that'd be a CVE.  So for the syzbot stuff mostly what you need to determine is:  a) is there a security related impact? AND b) can an attacker trigger it?  If both are yes, then a CVE is warranted.     > > > > References: > > > > > > > > > > > > > An upstream patch: > > > > https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/ > > > > > Best regards, > > Vladis Dronov | Red Hat, Inc. | Product Security Engineer > > Hi Vladis, > > I've been wondering, how do you choose which bugs you request CVEs > for?
