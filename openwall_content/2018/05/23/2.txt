Procps-ng has been released and includes most of our patches; it is available at:  https://sourceforge.net/projects/procps-ng/  The patches that are missing from procps-ng are:  - 7 low-priority patches which have not yet been validated   by upstream;  - most of our patches for top, which unfortunately have been reverted by   top's author; for example:   > Can you let us know which patches the CVEs align with as it will > make chasing all of this down a lot easier, thanks!  The patch for is:  The patch for is:  The patch for is:  The patch for is:  The patch for is:  The kernel patch for is:  There is currently no patch for because no satisfactory solution (secure and efficient) has been found. Please feel free to suggest ideas here!  > - which versions are vulnerable?  We did not try to track down the first vulnerable version, but we had a quick look at procps (from October and it was already vulnerable to the 5 CVEs.  > - which version was audited?  We audited procps-ng (the version used by many stable distributions), but we probably ended up reading most of the master branch too while writing the patches.  > what testing have you done?  Because procps-ng is a critical package, and because patches introduce significant changes, here is what we did to minimize the risks:  - we were two to perform the audit, and we decided to both write the   most important patches, independently; the final patches are the   result of this double-work, which clearly avoided a few bugs;  - we ran procps-ng's test-suite ("make check") after each change;  - we manually ran some tests after each major change, to make sure that   the code-path leading to the change is not broken, and to make sure   that the change actually fixes the issue;  - we started sending our patches to upstream on March 30 (for reviewing   and testing), long before we contacted linux-distros@;  - we contacted linux-distros@ on May 4, and were asked for an embargo   extension (for more time to review and test the patches), so we set   the Coordinated Release Date to May 17, UTC (13 days -- almost   the maximum embargo, but we wanted to avoid releasing on a Friday).  We are at your disposal for questions, comments, and further discussions. We thank Solar Designer and Kurt Seifried for their help!
