Since a vulnerability report works a lot better with an actual  exploitation scenario conducted with the actual application, that we can  look into, we will be waiting on that from you.  Also, FYI, we did apply mitigation for #1 (DLL sideloading attacks) very  shortly after the time it became publicized:  And of course, with proper non disparaging involvement of security  researchers, who subscribe to the established responsible disclosure  policy of their profession, we are always eager to improve on our  mitigation fixes, if it turns out they aren't adequate.  However, we would appreciate if you refrained from jumping to erroneous  conclusion about Rufus development being conducted by "bloody  beginners", when it is clear that some of the "beginner's"  vulnerabilities you list have long had some mitigation factors applied.
