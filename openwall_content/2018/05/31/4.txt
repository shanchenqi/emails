As always, your poor reading skills perfectly match your poor programming skills. READ THE SUBJECT!

Or shall I write: BWAHAHAHA!?  DLL spoofing was VERY well known long before and it is neither restricted to the CWD nor to runtime linking:  a) in the NSA-sponsored report "An intro to... Windows NT security"    (its copy <http://www.blacksheepnetworks.com/security/info/nt/ntintrotosec.htm>    is unfortunately gone) was published;  b) in Georgi Guninski published <http://www.guninski.com/officedll.html>  b) in the paper "DLL Spoofing in Windows"    <https://www.it.uu.se/edu/course/homepage/sakdat/ht05/assignments/pm/programme/DLL_Spoofing_in_Windows.pdf>    was published;  c) in Microsoft's David LeBlanc wrote       while CERT's Will Dormann wrote     d) in and Acros Security published <http://www.binaryplanting.com/>    plus  e) since then, Microsoft published          and     I recommend to do YOUR homework first, BEFORE you dare to publish software riddled with well-known and well-documented vulnerabilities, which allows escalation of privilege. It's YOUR duty to protect YOUR users.  As a starting point, read and try to understand <https://skanthak.homepage.t-online.de/sentinel.html> and <https://skanthak.homepage.t-online.de/!execute.html>  When done, continue with <https://skanthak.homepage.t-online.de/verifier.html> and <https://skanthak.homepage.t-online.de/minesweeper.html>  Until then, to protect your users, remove Rufus from the net!  > And of course, with proper non disparaging involvement of security  > researchers, who subscribe to the established responsible disclosure  > policy of their profession, we are always eager to improve on our  > mitigation fixes, if it turns out they aren't adequate. >  > However, we would appreciate if you refrained from jumping to erroneous  > conclusion about Rufus development being conducted by "bloody  > beginners", when it is clear that some of the "beginner's"  > vulnerabilities you list have long had some mitigation factors applied.  I recommend to read the advice other people gave you on SOME mitigations are clearly NOT sufficient, especially if you choose to apply the WRONG and IMPROPER mitigations.
