Fixed versions :    Description -----------  Due to insufficient validation of client-provided parameters during XMPP stream restarts, authenticated users may override the realm associated with their session, potentially bypassing security policies and allowing impersonation.  Details -------  Prosody did not verify that the virtual host associated with a user session remained the same across stream restarts.  In practice this means that a user may authenticate to XMPP host A and migrate their authenticated session to XMPP host B of the same Prosody instance.  Note that successful authentication to host A is required to initiate the attack. This includes SASL ANONYMOUS.  Overriding the authenticated username is not possible via this exploit, and this limits impersonation to usernames on host B that the attacker also has access to on host A. In the case of ANONYMOUS authentication, the username is random and enforced by the server.  If a user has the account user1@...ta.example, they may impersonate user1@...tb.example, with security policies of host B applied.  Affected configurations -----------------------  Prosody deployments configured with multiple virtual hosts are vulnerable.  Standard TCP connections and websocket connections are affected, but BOSH connections are not affected - i.e. deployments where the only access to Prosody is via BOSH are not vulnerable.  Temporary mitigation --------------------  Patch available.  -  stable branch: - old stable 0.9 branc:  Advice ------  All users should upgrade to at least or check their OS distribution for security updates. Users of development branches trunk) should upgrade to the latest nightly builds.
