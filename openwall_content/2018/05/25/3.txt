I wasn't asking "what qualifies > for a CVE?", but rather "There are a bugs that qualify for CVEs, > how do single out 10 of them to actually request CVEs for?". >  So if a security vulnerability qualifies for CVE INCLUSION (see https://cve.mitre.org/cve/editorial_policies/counting_rules.html) the next step is to SPLIT and MERGE the vulns as needed. Esentially what we want is to end up with buckets where each bucket of vulnerability(s) is:  1) unique to a specific code base 2) unique to a specific version(s)(*) 3) the same root cause (this is where you have to do homework)  * Note: the version thing, obviously the affected versions/commits for these will be different in the Linux kernel and so by this rule, strictly speaking each vuln would get it's own CVE, but in general if they all affect the same broad version of the Linux Kernel they can be bucketed together.  So assuming the homework is done of properly identifying and classifying these security vulnerabilities then you can simply request CVE's for all of them, the worst ones, or whatever you want. I would of course prefer that all of them be identified/tracked but that's just me.   > In particular, the bugs that I'm referring to are the bugs > reported by syzbot (perhaps there's even more: > https://syzkaller.appspot.com/?fixed=upstream) and the 10 bugs (or so) > are the ones Vladis announced on oss-security over the last few > months.
