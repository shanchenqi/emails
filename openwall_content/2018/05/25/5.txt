No, syzkaller/syzbot runs programs in a user namespace, so any distro that allows unprivileged users to create user namespaces (e.g. Ubuntu) is vulnerable to most of the bugs syzbot finds.  But nevertheless all those bugs need to be checked whether they actually are security flaws, and that requires quite a lot of effort.  > As for this particular bug in dccp_write_xmit() - I stumbled upon that > Syzbot's report and checked that the bug was exploitable by an unprivileged > user if dccp modules were loaded.

OK, if the process was like that for the rest of those bugs, that explains a somewhat random selection of syzbot bugs for which CVEs were assigned :)  Thanks!
