This can allow local privileged users to read previously set kernel memory contents when reading from the /dev/vhost-net device file.  This would be classified as an information leak that could be used to defeat other protection mechanisms.  As far as I can tell this information doesn't flow to guests, only to the parent system which is hosting the virtual machines.
