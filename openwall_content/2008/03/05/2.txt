I don't think you need root privileges to take advantage of this...  Let's assume shared box where users ssh -X and run some X programs, e.g. rxvt.  Let's assume unprivileged user can start local X session which will be DISPLAY=:0 and do xhost + to allow connections from other users to her display (maybe Xvnc can be used instead of local X session too).  Now she just have to wait for some other user to ssh without X forwarding and start rxvt on her display.  Yes, many assumptions and ifs, but still silently assuming DISPLAY=:0 when no DISPLAY is set does not sound like a safe default.  Just my 2c.  --  Tomas Hoger Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
