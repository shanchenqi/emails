Agreed.  > But then  I also don't understant what you mean by "setup an fake X   > server waiting for someone loggin in..."    This should be a matter of running 'startx' appropriately.  I was  under the misapprehension that only root could startup X, but that  seems not to be the case.    Providing the host wasn't already running X then it might be possible  for local users to launch a copy they control.  > Could you describe the attack scenario in  a bit more details?    I'd look forward to that too.
