Sorry for the delayed response - had some computer problems just as I was about to press "send" and forgot about this.  CCE is gaining a lot of ground these days as part of the US government's SCAP program for enterprise-level security information management (summarizing SCAP approximately at best).  We've identified some areas of potential overlap where both CCE and CVE could apply.  At this stage though, CCE is mostly about configuration/hardening at the OS layer, including major OS applications - that said, conceptually it could apply to any application.  Especially in cases where a "non-OS-level" application has a default configuration, or where a bug introduces a configuration issue, CVE continues to assign identifiers.  We'll also assign an identifier for a common misconfiguration, even if it's not the default.  So - use for this issue.  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
