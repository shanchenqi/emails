I mean, stuff being posted to oss-security is supposed to be either already public or intended to be made public right away.  > Are people OK with that?  Please go for it!  If you can, please use the official archive URLs, currently at:  	http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/  In case this is moved - e.g., to the oss-security website - we'll make sure to put proper redirects in place, such that every message's URL remains valid.  While the software powering this archive is currently quite spartan, I think it suffices this purpose (CVE refs) well - and its further development was just revitalized.  By the way, maybe we should also add a link to the oss-security wiki to page footers on that archive?  Or even to message trailers (such that the wiki link will be seen on third-party archives as well)?  Oh, and someone should write a wiki page about getting CVE IDs.  This is currently mentioned as a FIXME here:  	http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/disclosure/researcher  Thanks,  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
