I've taken care of this.  Next time, please look at the message headers for the mailing list manager's unsubscribe/subscribe/help addresses.  In case this sort of requests become common, we'll have to add message trailers with instructions in them and/or pre-moderate the list even for postings from subscribers.  The john-users mailing list that we run on this same server currently has both of these things, so it's a matter of changing the settings.
