Clicking fast enough to enter some commands is not that easy, and not every program will allow direct entering of commands, so I guess are most programs are only usability problems (you get to wait 3 to 10 seconds before you get an error message when by mistake starting it via an ssh without -X), and a malicious fake X server would most likely be prepared for every single program (to reject unexploitable programe early so it is not noticed, and to send the keyboard events to the right window), so most programs might not be that much of a problem.  On the other hand, having so many different terminals with almost identical source might make it even easier to write one exploit that can cope with all of them.  Hochachtungsvoll, 	Bernhard R.
