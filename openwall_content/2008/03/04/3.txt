So, I'll fill in the CVE > later once this has been fleshed out.    It seems like an issue which I'd almost be tempted to say isn't  a security one.    The idea is that if you typically connect to a host with display  forwarding you'll be used to running rxvt and having the resulting  application display locally.    However if you forget to enable display forwarding then run  RXVT it will connect to :1, rather than complain there is no  DISPLAY set and abort.  That *could* allow a malicious local  server to steal keyboard, & etc.    However I have a hard time seeing this in practise.  It would  mean that locally you couldn't trust root - since it would take  a local root user to setup the fake X11 server on :1..    This attack is like saying that if you forget to open your  eyes you might accidentally walk into the wrong house and  have people see what you're doing..
