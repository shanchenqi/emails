"If the DISPLAY environment is not set, rxvt opens an xterm  on :0, which on some headless login-server means anyone can setup  an fake X server waiting for someone loggin in without X  forwarding to start rxvt by some mistake or by some program (thus  without even noticing) and getting full shell access to that other  account."  This is Debian bug  It should be a good idea to check other terminal emulators  as well.
