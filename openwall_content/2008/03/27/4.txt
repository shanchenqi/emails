As you gave me the advice that since the codebases are different, they should get separate ids.  We can always yank if you wish and I'll see about getting upstream to remove it from the advisory.  If we're keeping it would probably be wise of Mozilla to clarify is for the JVM.  Thanks.  --      JB  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
