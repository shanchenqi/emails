It seems that this call a few lines above the snippet shown above:  sub = cupsdAddSubscription(mask, printer, job, recipient, 0);  will return NULL when the hardcoded value of subscriptions is hit.  So really the issu here is a lack of error checking which results in a NULL dereference crash.  The upstream fix could still obviously let a local authenticated user crash the server.  I'm not sure why yet, but this doesn't crash cups for me (which it should).  --      JB  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
