The security fix mentioned actually consists of limiting its impact to prevent running arbitrary programs. I'm afraid Ethan got things wrong. It's the authorization check bypass that's fixed in  The timeline (in version-perspective) looks something like this: Vulnerable to both issues, with the combination being that CSRF        attacks can trigger arbitrary programs to run. Vulnerable to CSRF attacks, but CHANGE_ commands (that can be        used to trigger arbitrary programs) are completely blocked. Impact        is thereby lowered to commands the tricked user is allowed to        submit (which can still be rather bad).  So in essence, an orthogonal fix lowered the worst-case scenario impact of in Nagios but the base issue still remains.  Hope that clears things up.  --  Andreas Ericsson                   andreas.ericsson@....se OP5 AB                             www.op5.se Tel: +46                  Fax: +46  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
