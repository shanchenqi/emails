It provides         a number of utilities including a flexible and scalable multi-threaded         daemon, a command line scanner and advanced tool for automatic         database updates. The core of the package is an anti-virus engine         available in a form of shared library."  Vulnerability description:          ClamAV contains an off-by-one heap overflow vulnerability in the         code responsible for parsing VBA project files. Successful         exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with         the privileges of the `clamd' process by sending an email with a         prepared attachment.          The vulnerability occurs inside the get_unicode_name() function         in libclamav/vba_extract.c when a specific `name' buffer is passed         to it. ...    --  Bye,      Thomas --   Thomas Biege <thomas@...e.de>, SUSE LINUX, Security Support & Auditing  SUSE LINUX Products GmbH, GF: Markus Rex, HRB (AG Nuernberg) --             Hamming's Motto:            The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers.                                 -- Richard W.
