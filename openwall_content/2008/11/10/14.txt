The information we had available at the time of request didn't suggest different versions being affected.  For example, the upstream advisory doesn't mention anything about different versions, and both Tobias Klein advisories say "VLC media player <  So at the time of assignment, Best Available Information (the cornerstone of CVE analysis) was that they were the same type of issue affecting the same versions.  This is becoming a big problem for us in CVE - requests to oss-security are coming in without the kind of information that we rely on heavily to decide when we have one CVE or multiple CVE's.  Compared to last year, the requests are coming in when the information's less mature, *and* public. So we wind up having to do some of the research ourselves, which slows us down.  And as you see here, we still make mistakes.  Once the CVE's public, then it's hard to change, because we don't know who else is using it.  In the past, if something came up during a CVE request that triggered a split, the split could occur before the CVE ever became public.  Anybody on this list who has suggestions for handling this, please let me know offline.  We've only recently begun to identify the significant impact that oss-security is having on our CVE process.  For the time being, I'll likely be asking more questions before assigning CVE ID's.  Oh, the split... well in this case, I guess it's OK since the CVE only just went out.  But I REALLY don't like doing this because we don't know how many "downstream" CVE consumers are already using it, so I definitely don't want to make a habit of it.   - CUE image file, cdrom.c  - RealText file, subtitle.c   - Steve  ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] CVE id request: vlc Reference: Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] VideoLAN security advisory Reference: Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] Re: CVE id request: vlc Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference:  Stack-based buffer overflow in VideoLAN VLC media player through might allow user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code via the header of an invalid CUE image file, related to modules/access/vcd/cdrom.c.
