The following is the description of the hfs bug: "Fix a stack corruption caused by a corrupted hfs filesystem.  If the catalog name length is corrupted the memcpy overwrites the catalog btree structure.  Since the field is limited to HFS_NAMELEN bytes in the structure and the file format, we throw an error if it is too long."  It is possible to use the 7-hexdigit instead of the usual 40-hexdigit SHA1 hash to refer to the commit ID.
