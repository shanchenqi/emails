Just a quick question: the check in add_job_subscriptions() is catching non-NULL result of cupsdAddSubscription, but for the failed subscription is does not inform user about this.  The code in create_subscription() returns error.  Is it intentional?  Client gets nothing (at least 'lpr -m file.txt' outputs no error), but subscription is silently dropped. --  Eygene  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
