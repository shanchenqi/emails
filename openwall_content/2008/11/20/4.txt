[...]  A more important issue has been silently fixed as well. Unfortunately  I can not find a public reference or a changelog entry to it.  A user can get geshi into an infinite loop and thus causing  a DoS (php process will eat a lot CPU) by highlighting a  crafted xml sequence. As a PoC '<' works.  The upstream fix for this is   Let me explain a little. geshi.php:            $code = "\n" . $code . "\n";     ..            $length           = strlen($code);     ..                for ($i = 0; $i < $length; ++$i) {                    foreach ($this->language_data['SCRIPT_DELIMITERS'] as $delimiters) {                        foreach ($delimiters as $open => $close) {                            // Get the next little bit for this opening string                            $open_strlen = strlen($open);                            $check = substr($code, $i, $open_strlen);                            // If it matches...                            if ($check == $open) {     ..                                $parts[$k][0] = $open;                                $close_i = strpos($code, $close, $i + $open_strlen)  + strlen($close);                                if ($close_i === false) {                                    $close_i = $length - 1;                                }     ..                                $i = $close_i - 1;     ..                            }                        }                    }  $this->language_data['SCRIPT_DELIMITERS'] is defined as an array of arrays that holds start and end tags, in the case for xml this is holds a tuple ('<', '>') and assigns them to $open and $close.  For < in line strpos will fail resulting in false because there is no close tag.  Adding strlen($close) to it will result in $close_i being 1. In line $i will be set $close_i - 1 resulting in 1 being 0. Loop starts again and $i is 1 again -> infinite loop.  Steve, can you assign a CVE id to this? This should affect every version <  Cheers Nico  --  Nico Golde - http://www.ngolde.de - nion@...ber.ccc.de - GPG: For security reasons, all text in this mail is double-rot13 encrypted.
