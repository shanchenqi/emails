I had a look at upstream's patch[0] and compared it with packages in debian.  We had 6 packages including the file Snoopy.class.php, all were vulnerable. List of packages: ampache: /usr/share/ampache/www/modules/infotools/Snoopy.class.php libphp-snoopy: /usr/share/php/libphp-snoopy/Snoopy.class.php mahara: /usr/share/mahara/lib/snoopy/Snoopy.class.php mediamate: /usr/share/mediamate/Snoopy.class.php opendb: /usr/share/opendb/functions/Snoopy.class.php pixelpost: /usr/share/pixelpost/addons/_defensio/libraries/Snoopy.class.php  I haven't checked, how they depend on the Snoopy.class.php file yet. Of course there might be more out there and included in other distributions,  so don't assume that this is all. The packages in debian duplicating the  source should just depend on the libphp-snoopy package, which in debian is  the snoopy upstream package.  Steve, do you want to update the CVE description to reflect that the file is  included in several other packages?
