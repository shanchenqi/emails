Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE request: kernel: Unix sockets kernel panic  Hi,  We need a CVE name for this issue. This was reported in netdev today.  "The following code causes a kernel panic on Linux http://darkircop.org/unix.c  I haven't investigated the bug so I'm not sure what is causing it, and don't know if it's exploitable.  The code passes unix sockets from one process to another using unix sockets.  The bug probably has to do with closing file descriptors."   There isn't a fix yet. Dave is working on it.  Thanks, Eugene  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
