If you have been using libcdaudio packages based on ATrpms / Fedora, you may have which addresses the same issue, it only mallocs more instead of fgetsing less.   This issue does not seem to affect CDDB code used by grip/gnome-vfs2, which may have common origin and previously had some flaws identical to libcdaudio (see below).
