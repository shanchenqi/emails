Arguably it could go the other way, but CVE generally doesn't cover what I call "design limitations" - issues that are not fundamental security vulnerabilities in themselves, but which make it easier for others to introduce them.  THe ecryptfs-setup-private feature of accepting command-line password arguments isn't fundamentally different than strcpy()'s feature of happily writing past the end of the buffer if that's what it's told to do.  This line continues to get fuzzy, however.  - Steve  ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] CVE request for ecryptfs Reference: Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] Re: CVE request for ecryptfs Reference: Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] Re: CVE request for ecryptfs Reference: Reference: Reference:  The (1) ecryptfs-setup-private, (2) ecryptfs-setup-confidential, and (3) ecryptfs-setup-pam-wrapped.sh scripts in ecryptfs-utils 45 through 61 in eCryptfs place cleartext passwords on command lines, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information by listing the process.
