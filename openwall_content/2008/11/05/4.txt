Alternatively, the VCD and Subtitles plugins (libvcd_plugin.* and  libsubtitle_plugin.*) can be removed manually from the VLC plugin  installation directory. However, this will prevent use of subtitle files and  Video CD altogether.   - Solution -  VLC media player addresses this issue. Patches for older versions are  available from the official VLC source code repository 0.9-bugfix branch.    - Credits -  These vulnerabilities were reported by Tobias Klein.    - References -  The VideoLAN project 	http://www.videolan.org/  Tobias Klein 	http://www.trapkit.de/advisories/    - History -  3 November 	Vendor notification. 4 November 	Internal patches for VLC development version and 0.9-bugfix tree. 5 November 	Initial security advisory. 	VLC media player released.  --  RĂŠmi Denis-Courmont, on behalf of the VideoLAN project  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
