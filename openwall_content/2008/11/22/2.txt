Note that xine_xmalloc is specifically designed to allocate memory when passed size 0. Upstream seems to move away from it, but... As Will notices, demux-qt.c has loads of unfixed problems.  If anyone cares to go over the xine-lib issues (primarily the unfixed ones from Will's section 3), I'd much appreciate a CC. In order to make the analysis and verification more, I would also be interested in the test cases mentioned in the advisory.  Kind regards  T.  1. 2. --  Thomas Viehmann, http://thomas.viehmann.net/   View attachment of type "text/x-patch" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
