There are very minimal SVN version differences.  This was a tough call on our part, but basically is fixed and based on what we saw, was not.  Details below.  - Steve  ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Acknowledged: yes Announced: Flaw: undiag Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] Regarding (Smarty "_expand_quoted_text()" Security Bypass) Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: CONFIRM:http://smarty-php.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/NEWS Reference: Reference: Reference:  The _expand_quoted_text function in libs/Smarty_Compiler.class.php in Smarty before allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via vectors related to templates and (1) a dollar-sign character, aka "php executed in templates;" and (2) a double quoted literal string, aka a "function injection security hole." NOTE: each vector affects slightly different SVN revisions.   Analysis: ACKNOWLEDGEMENT: says "patch for security, php executed in templates."  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT: smarty-php.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/NEWS says "fix ... function injection security hole closed (U.Tews)."  ABSTRACTION: There are different patches to _expand_quoted_text in different SVN revisions. Because googlecode.com allows public SVN access, end users may have obtained any of these revisions and deployed it. Typically CVE would MERGE across SVN revisions, and would instead create a single candidate for all (otherwise MERGEable) issues that were fixed between two released versions. However, the situation here is that none of the SVN revisions are yet incorporated into any released version, so it is arguable that this could be SPLIT.  ABSTRACTION: as of the "\$" issue in was unfixed, so it is SPLIT from the others. Arguably this should have been done for the other two as well.  INCLUSION: Admittedly, the vendor later reverted However, it is still a vendor announcement of a security fix, when operating from the perspective that end users realistically obtain the product through SVN.  INCLUSION: Admittedly, a third party later concluded that was a largely ineffective patch.
