The chroot(2) man page is quite clear that if you don't call chdir() first, the process will inherit a '.' that is outside of the chroot.  By itself this isn't really a flaw (you'll need some other exploit to even attempt to break out of the chroot), and chroot can be broken out of various other ways. Typically chroot() should not be considered secure, but I suspect this should probably get an ID if for no other reason than avoiding future confusion.  Thanks.  --      JB  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
