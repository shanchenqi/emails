The CERT secure coding rules here:  https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/cplusplus/FIO16-CPP.+Limit+access+to+files+by+creating+a+jail  suggest it might be safer AFTER, not before, due to some race condition possibilities.  - Steve  ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Reference: Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] CVE Request (syslog-ng) Reference:  syslog-ng does not call chdir before it calls chroot, which might allow attackers to escape the intended jail.
