While digging around I found out that there are 2 other issues that were quite silently fixed in the Little CMS updates tagged as fixing as done by various vendors.  The issues are:  The ReadEmbeddedTextTag in src/cmsio1.c did not properly check amount of data read from the input file to the buffer provided as one of it's arguments.  Value read from the file was used as an upper bound without any validation.  This issue was fixed upstream in  Attached is the patch against lcms packages as was used in SuSE security updates (original name of the patch as used in SuSE and Mandriva SRPMS is but it is not a fix for was fixed upstream in and the correct patch for it is named named liblcms-<version>-icc.diff in SuSE / Mandriva SRPMS).  Upstream CVS commit:   Another issue is unsigned -> signed integer cast issue in cmsAllocGamma in src/cmsgamma.c.  The argument to this function - nEntries - may be read from the file and not validated before cmsAllocGamma is called. As nEntries in cmsAllocGamma is signed integer, it's value may possibly be negative and can result in an insufficient memory allocation.  This issue was fixed upstream in  Again, attached is the patch extracted from SuSE security updates for  Original name was lcms-gamma-overflow.patch.  Upstream CVS commit:   As both of these fixes date back to and were used in the security advisory in they may need CVE id.  Steven, can you get us some?
