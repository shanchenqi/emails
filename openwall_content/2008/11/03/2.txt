Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org>, Greg KH <greg@...ah.com> Subject: CVE requests: kernel: hfsplus-related bugs  These were committed in upstream kernel. Reported by Eric Sesterhenn.  1) hfsplus: fix Buffer overflow with a corrupted image Upstream commit:  When an hfsplus image gets corrupted it might happen that the catalog namelength field gets b0rked.  If we mount such an image the memcpy() in hfsplus_cat_build_key_uni() writes more than the that fit in the name field.  Depending on the size of the overwritten data, we either only get memory corruption or also trigger an oops.  2) hfsplus: check read_mapping_page() return value Upstream commit:  The return value of read_mapping_page() is passed on to kmap unchecked.  The bug is triggered after the first read_mapping_page() in hfsplus_block_allocate(), this patch fixes all three usages in this functions but leaves the ones further down in the file unchanged. This was triggered by mounting an intentionally corrupted image.  These bugs need CVE names.
