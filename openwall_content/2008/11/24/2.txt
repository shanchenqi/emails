The lock file is truncated after a simple open call. AFAICS creating /tmp/vbox-$USER-ipc before the victim starts VirtualBox could therefore be exploited to create files as the victim or truncate files of the victim.  cu Ludwig  --   (o_   Ludwig Nussel  //\     V_/_  http://www.suse.de/ SUSE LINUX Products GmbH, GF: Markus Rex, HRB (AG Nuernberg)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
