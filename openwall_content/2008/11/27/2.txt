It requires a CVE name.  "Reported and fixed by Dann Frazier <dannf@...com>: This is an implementation of David Miller's suggested fix in:    Paraphrasing the description from the above report, it makes sendmsg() block while UNIX garbage collection is in progress. This avoids a situation where child processes continue to queue new FDs over a AF_UNIX socket to a parent which is in the exit path and running garbage collection on these FDs. This contention can result in soft lockups and oom-killing of unrelated processes."
