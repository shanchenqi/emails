I'd appreciate these *not* being committed to the 1.1 tip: just make sure that I get the patch series (no more than one CVE no. per patch), prepared so that I can just "hg import" each one, and I'll handle things from there. (Somebody, probably me, will have to backport at least some of this lot for etch, and separate patches should make this a bit easier.)  I'm currently not sure whether to do or mainly because can be uploaded to unstable and still make it into lenny; OTOH, that'd be a new sourceful upload. And I'm not sure that we're ready for yet anyway.  --  | Darren Salt    | linux or ds at              | nr.
