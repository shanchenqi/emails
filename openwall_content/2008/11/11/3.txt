Compared to last year, the > requests are coming in when the information's less mature, *and* public.  CVE.mitre.org says nothing about vendor obtaining a CVE number, only researchers. And typically, these guys don't do it, when dealing with videolan.org anyway.  Also consider our project structure: We have a large code base with lots of legacy, so lots of bugs. We have a large user base, so we're an attractive target. We have had very few security analysis until recently, so there is a lot more CVEs to come by any chance. We're almost entirely run by loosely coordinated volunteers (including myself) so you cannot expect much more dedication. And we are hardly supported by distributions (basically only Debian and Gentoo), such that almost nobody will care on vendor-sec.  Now I am happy to adapt our security handling process a bit, if MITRE, Debian or whatever other involved party wants. But I am still waiting for clear guidelines.
