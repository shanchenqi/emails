According to the feedback Fedora maintainer got from new upstream, comix 3.x is mostly dead and upstream is focused on re-written version 4.  See for upstream reply.  That BZ also has some comments on the insecure temporary file usage reported to Debian BTS.  And also notes that comix is likely an app where unfixed tarfile python module may bite back.  As for comix vs. comicthumb, I guess once CVE id is sufficient.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
