Josh had correctly pointed out that the requested pagemove functionality didn't work as expected, I investigated this and found out that the pagemove plugin was enabled to the admin group only.  I have fixed the issue by adding an additional ACL check for managers (those who are members of the editor group).  Those of you who see the Admin button at the bottom of the Wiki can use the pagemove plugin from now on.  I've briefly described how to move/rename a page at the following URL:  http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/wiki/plugins/hints/editor  Another important change is that I re-configured the Wiki to use '-' (dash) instead of '_' (underscore) as a word separator for page names. This was done per previous (unfortunately) private discussion to make all pages look consistent.  This change has affected one Wiki page. it's code-reviews.  Since that page contains a stub I thought that it's OK that I've simply renamed the page without placing a proper redirect back.  Please let me know if I was wrong and I'll put a redirection there.  --  (GM)   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
