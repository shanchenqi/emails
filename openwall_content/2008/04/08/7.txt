OK, that's up to you indeed, and I appreciate your work on the wiki a lot.  I just thought that we could proceed with these tasks in parallel to have something ready sooner rather than later.  And it does not have to be a "big" public announcement right away - but having some announcement text that this group is comfortable with would be helpful.  > I'm not pleased with this unneeded pressure being placed on this group > because of the desire of oCERT.  That's not how I see it.  We had an opportunity here, which we could use if we wanted to - but we chose not to.  That's all.  > We also need to sort out the mailing list situation before we can > reasonably expect what will be a spike of interest.  We can trivially turn message moderation on for everyone - which is what I will do as soon as we start getting undesirable postings.  So I am not afraid of this list being announced on Bugtraq & f-d right now.  We can also implement your desired setup, but possibly not right away.  > Did anyone disagree with my proposal yesterday?  It looks like everyone is fine with it, and I have just responded to that message.
