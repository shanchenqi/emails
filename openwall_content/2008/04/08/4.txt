I have quite a few more pressing matters to attend to, and for the limited oss-security time I have, I plan to clean up the wiki a bit in preparation for a public announcement.  I think oCERT needs to do their own thing here.  I'm not pleased with this unneeded pressure being placed on this group because of the desire of oCERT.  We also need to sort out the mailing list situation before we can reasonably expect what will be a spike of interest.  Did anyone disagree with my proposal yesterday?  Thanks.  --      JB  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
