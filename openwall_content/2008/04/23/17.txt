Unfortunately, according to Lars, to get the messages re-imported I'd have to mangle their Message-IDs.  I'm afraid that there's no way to do this correctly - even if I identify just the missing messages, change Message-IDs on them, and change In-Reply-To and References on messages in my local archive accordingly, that won't help to get the missing messages properly threaded with those that are still seen at Gmane (and are not to be re-imported).  Perhaps the only solution would be to drop and re-import the entire list into Gmane.  I don't think we care about those missing messages from February that much (and they're seen just fine on other archives of the list), so I am not going to do anything about this (and bother Lars with it again).  Sorry about that.  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
