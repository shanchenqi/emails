Well, this turned out to be a trivial change to the ezmlm-gate line in the editor file; it's just that it was beyond the capabilities of ezmlm-make (so we'll need to remember to not lose this custom change when re-configuring the list later).  The list should now be message-moderated for everyone except for people (or rather, for their envelope-from addresses) who have subscribed or posted desirable messages until today.  As more people (or addresses) make desirable postings, we may be adding those to the "allow" list as well (or maybe not - this is up to us).  Let's see how this works in practice.
