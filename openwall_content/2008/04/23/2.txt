Thanks for taking the time to set this up.  So, this means that anyone from this point on who subscribes to the list does so effectively as read-only, and messages they send will be held for moderation. Similarly, folks who aren't subscribed at all will be held for moderation, but not rejected automatically. Folks in the white list (whether or not they are subscribed) can post with no delay, and everyone who has posted a message prior to today is in the white list. Right?  	smithj  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =1NLA -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
