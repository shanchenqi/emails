Any suggestions on the URLs to use for these versions?  Message threading is very helpful to Steve/CVE and other VDBs. I'll let  him speak to his wishes obviously.  >From the OSVDB side, if the URLs would use a year/month scheme at the  least, that would be ideal. We do not reference mail list archives like  SecurityFocus or MARC unless we have to, as their URLs aren't very  informative by themselves.    : Jonathan, jericho, and everyone else - :  : As to submitting this list to more third-party archives, while I  : appreciate this being done, I'd like to be given a chance to provide the  : archive with past messages.  It often takes more time to get those  : messages imported when the list is already submitted.  I've e-mailed  : Fyodor and the Neohapsis folks now.  It's no issue with Neohapsis. I've had them backfill archives in the  past, and they can do it trivially with the messages in several formats.  I had this in mind when I contacted them.
