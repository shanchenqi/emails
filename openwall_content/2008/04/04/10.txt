Good idea.  Also, maybe you could invite them to join this mailing list? (Perhaps ask me first to confirm that they are not already on the list.)  BTW, we currently have two pages with vendor info: one is with security contacts and advisory links, and the other is with "patch-finding" info. Perhaps you should update both whenever you can obtain the necessary info.  Or maybe we should combine them into one page - this needs to be discussed in here first.
