As I see it, the list is for members of the open-source community. Thus, to be admitted to the list, you either have to demonstrate that you're a developer of a (at least marginally notable) open source project, that you're a vendor who redistributes oss, or that you're a security researcher who audits or otherwise interacts with oss.  This is, of course, only my opinion and may not reflect the rest of the group's ideas.  	smithj  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =/Fvu -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
