Further investigation showed that several packages include similar code and are therefore vulnerable.  In order to prevent the usage of incorrect header processing reference code, the speex_packet_to_header() function has been modified to bound the returned mode values in Speex >= This change automatically fixes applications that use the Speex library dynamically.  Affected version:  gstreamer-plugins-good <= SDL_sound <= Speex <= (speexdec) Sweep <= vorbis-tools <= VLC Media Player <= xine-lib <= XMMS speex plugin  Fixed version:  gstreamer-plugins-good, >= (patched in CVS) SDL_sound, patched in CVS Speex >= (patched in CVS) Sweep >= vorbis-tools, patched in CVS VLC Media Player, N/A xine-lib >= XMMS speex plugin, N/A  Credit: see additionally we would like to thank Tomas Hoger from the Red Hat Security Response Team for his help in investigating the issue.  CVE:  Timeline: investigation of leads to discovery of more affected packages Speex header processing code fixed in CVS contacted upstream maintainers and affected vendors gstreamer-plugins-good patched in CVS sweep released SDL_sound patched in CVS vorbis-tools patched in CVS xine-lib released advisory release  References:  Links: http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/modules/gst-plugins-good.html http://icculus.org/SDL_sound http://www.speex.org http://www.metadecks.org/software/sweep/ http://xiph.org http://www.videolan.org/vlc http://xinehq.de  Permalink:  --  Andrea Barisani |                Founder & Project Coordinator           oCERT | Open Source Computer Emergency Response Team  <lcars@...rt.org>                         http://www.ocert.org  02CD CE7F AC3F DA47 9B9E         "Pluralitas non est ponenda sine necessitate"  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
