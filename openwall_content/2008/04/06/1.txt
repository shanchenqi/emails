A user controlled field in the header structure is used to build a function pointer. The libfishsound implementation does not check for negative values for the field, allowing the function pointer to be pointed at an arbitary position in memory. This allows remote code execution.  A patch has been committed to the libfishsound public repository.  Affected version: <=  Fixed version: current svn tree  Additional affected packages:  Illuminable DirectShow Filters for Ogg Vorbis, which statically include the libfishsound library.
