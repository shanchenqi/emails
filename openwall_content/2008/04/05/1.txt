Yes, I think that's best.  No sense in adding a link to a project nobody really knows about (which is by design).  >  > OK, can we please start figuring this out, then?

I'd like to see us work on the wiki content a bit more.  Perhaps a todo page where we can list new content needed, and point at content that needs some help.  Is there an easy way we can create an index of content that has the FIXME wiki tag?  >  > Let's just not leave things undefined and non-announced forever.

I don't think anyone wants this, but just as never making ourselves known is bad, a premature announcement isn't much good either.  I think we're close, but not quite there yet.  We do however need to be mindful of the old quote "perfect is the enemy of the good".  > >  > > Yep. But, I still think we should allow read-only memberships without > > moderation.

A semi moderated list is going to be the way to go I suspect.
