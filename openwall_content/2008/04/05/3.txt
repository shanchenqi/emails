I think this is a good definition.  Bottom-line would be that this isn't a list for end-users.  End-users or sysadmins, whatever, could be read-only subscribers... heck, that's no different than reading web archives.  But to be a "member" of the list, with posting priveleges, I think you need to be someone who can demonstrate an active role with some OSS -- this does not mean you need to be on a vendor security team, or the apache/samba/whatever security contact.  You could be a grunt developer who has an interest in security-related stuff (perhaps good programming techniques, etc.) and as long as you're a member or developer of some OSS with a reasonable exposure, then I think you can have a voice on the list if you like.  Honestly, I think a lot of people will be lurkers... so for them they never need to progress beyond read-only subscriber.  It's the people who are interested in security (be it re-active or pro-active) that will want to be "members" of the list.  Now, having said that, I think the ml subscription can be a lot more open than wiki editing rights (which is a whole different ball of wax).  --  Vincent Danen @ http://linsec.ca/  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
