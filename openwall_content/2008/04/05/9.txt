On our wiki, we have a separation between distro vendors and individual Open Source projects - and I like it.  I haven't found a way to extract a list of distro vendors only from osvdb.org.  Also, some vendors and projects may have relevant info that just does not fit into pre-defined fields on osvdb.org - yet it may be specified in entries on the wiki.  It is a good idea to update the info at osvdb.org with whatever we have. For example, I was not able to find rPath in the osvdb.org database. Then the vendors/projects themselves would need to remember to keep those entries up to date as well...  Also, we should definitely link to osvdb.org.
