I've added links to OSVDB and to the OSVDB vendors database page to:  	http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/vendors 	http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/software 	http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/links  "OSVDB maintains The Vendor Dictionary, an extensive database of software and appliance vendors (not limited to Open Source ones)."  "http://osvdb.org - OSVDB (The Open Source Vulnerability Database)"  I've also cross-linked our vendors, software, and infrastructure pages.
