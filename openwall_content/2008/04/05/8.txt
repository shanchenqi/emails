A semi moderated list is going to be the way to go I suspect.  On Fri, Apr 04, at Vincent Danen wrote: > ... I don't think we need to moderate member postings.

Unfortunately, ezmlm-idx does not have a notion of having different types of subscribers to a list - "members who can post" vs. "read-only subscribers".  Yet, if this is really what we want (any other opinions?), we may be able to achieve it in one of two ways:  1. Use the "allow" list feature to specify the addresses of "full members".  Unfortunately, in my experience the "allow" list is used for lists that are moderated for non-subscribers only (to allow some non-subscribers or alternate addresses of subscribers to post without moderation), not for those that are also moderated for subscribers. I have not looked into whether this would be easy to fix or not - but I or someone else at Openwall can look into it if needed.  It might turn out that the fix is trivial.  2. Setup a second list for the read-only subscribers, and subscribe that list to the main one.  However, Vincent also wrote:  > I think maybe a moderated subscription, and unmoderated postings (for > members, moderated non-subscriber postings mandatory) would be a good > way to do it.  which confuses me.  Why moderate mere subscriptions if they're to be made read-only by default?  I think that our choice is between the setup described above (with full members and read-only subscribers) and the more common and tested setup with full moderation (and perhaps multiple moderators to minimize delays).  With the latter, the moderators themselves will be able to post with almost no delay by approving their own postings.  In fact, I think that when a moderator posts, ezmlm-idx only notifies the specific moderator - not all moderators.  So if we "promote" the most active list members to moderators, their postings should cause no moderation requests being sent to anyone other than themselves.

An undesirable posting to the list will just stay on the archives (I don't think we want to spend time on getting such postings removed from archives, especially not from third-party ones).  On the contrary, any damage to the wiki content is easily and promptly undone - as you know, a few of us are receiving e-mails on any wiki edits.  If by "ml subscription" you meant the read-only and/or message-moderated subscriptions, then I agree - those should be open to anyone.  In fact, non-subscribers should also be able to post, subject to moderation - at least because it is common for subscribers to post from other addresses occasionally.
