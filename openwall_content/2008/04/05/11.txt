On our wiki, we have a separation between distro  : vendors and individual Open Source projects - and I like it.  I haven't  : found a way to extract a list of distro vendors only from osvdb.org.  Based on what I have seen from this list, that is a very important  distinction and something the Wiki may be better suited for. OSVDB aims to  focus more on 'where the vulnerability is' over 'who distributes' it. The  more I work on VDBs, the more I realize that it becomes a mess trying to  track some open-source packages and what products/packages use them.  : Also, some vendors and projects may have relevant info that just does  : not fit into pre-defined fields on osvdb.org - yet it may be specified  : in entries on the wiki.  OSVDB has a 'notes' field for each vendor to accomodate this.  We actually have tickets open to expand the vendor database to include a  rating system for vendor response, tickets open to track more dates  related to the disclosure of a vulnerability (and then automatically  generate time based statistics for vendors), and more. I know our system  isn't perfect by any means, but we'd love to expand and build our vendor  database as much as possible.  : It is a good idea to update the info at osvdb.org with whatever we have.  : For example, I was not able to find rPath in the osvdb.org database.  : Then the vendors/projects themselves would need to remember to keep  : those entries up to date as well...  Right, good chance we don't have rPath and a few other linux distros.  However, you or anyone else can add them in one way or another. If you  find a vulnerability that affects rPath, you can add them to the product  list on the given entry, which populates the vendor database.
