The update includes all previous 1.4 updates and requires no schema update (if  you upgrade within the 1.4 release).  The fixed security problems are grave, if you have directories writable by the  webserver in you docroot (in most windows server the complete docroot  writable by default, but many linux servers are also set up that way).    --  Hanno Bรถck		Blog:		http://www.hboeck.de/ GPG:  Download attachment "signature.asc " of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
