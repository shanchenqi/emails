Full description follows (version has not yet been released, but will follow once I've got a CVE 8-).  ## Cross Site Request Forging  Cross Site Request Forging could be used to constuct a link that would change a logged-in user's password or other preferences if they clicked on the link. It could also be used to construct a link that would cause a wiki page to be modified by a logged-in user.  These holes were discovered on 10 April and fixed the same day with the release of ikiwiki A fix was also backported to Debian etch, as version I recommend upgrading to one of these versions.
