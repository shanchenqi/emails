Volkerding" <security@...ckware.com> To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: Security fixes in  Hello all,  GNU was released on  While browsing the ChangeLog  (and then NEWS) I noticed these security related items.  I'm not sure  how severe the impact is of these issues, but since I have not seen them  mentioned on any security lists yet a heads-up seemed to be in order.   From the ChangeLog:  Minor security fix: Quote output of mkstemp. * src/builtin.c (mkstemp_helper): Produce quoted output. * doc/m4.texinfo (Mkstemp): Update the documentation and tests. * NEWS: Document this change.  Security fix: avoid arbitrary code execution with 'm4 -F'. * src/freeze.c (produce_frozen_state): Never pass raw file name as printf format. * NEWS: Document this fix.   From the NEWS file:  ** Security fixes for the -F option, for bugs present since -F was  introduced in 1.3: Avoid core dump with 'm4 -F file -t undefined', and  avoid arbitrary code execution with certain file names.  ** The output of the `maketemp' and `mkstemp' builtins is now quoted if a file was created. This is a minor security fix, because it was  possible (although rather unlikely) that an unquoted string could match  an existing macro name, such that use of the `mkstemp' output would  trigger inadvertent macro expansion and operate on the wrong file name.
