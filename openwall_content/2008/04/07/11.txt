FWIW, there are also actual gcc bugs that cause miscompiles - and they may potentially result in security vulnerabilities - yet I am not sure if "proactively" treating the gcc bugs themselves as security issues is appropriate.  This is interesting - here we have a gcc non-bug that deserves a CERT Vulnerability Note and a CVE number (which I agree with), yet actual bugs might not deserve such treatment.  Here's an example of an actual bug - - this one caused my Blowfish implementation to be miscompiled, possibly making the cipher weaker (in case the misbehavior went unnoticed).  By the way, I was surprised by how quickly this one was confirmed (16 minutes) and fixed (less than a day).
