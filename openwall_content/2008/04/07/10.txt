If we end up using some bizarre solution with multiple lists to work around the ezmlm-idx shortcomings, we need to ensure that this is not obvious to the end users.  Users should be able to hit reply and the right thing just happens.   For the wiki, I'd say just make it a free for all.  If they take the time to create an account, let them make changes, we'll keep an eye on what gets modified.  We can deal with spam if it becomes a problem.  If you don't like this, speak up now, otherwise, I think it would make sense to find a solution that fits this model.  --      JB  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
