My solution was perhaps a little too convoluted and/or paranoid... take your pick.  =)  >For the wiki, I'd say just make it a free for all.

There's, what, a half-dozen of us that are getting notices of changes to the wiki so any problems should be picked up and corrected pretty quickly.  >If you don't like this, speak up now, otherwise, I think it would make >sense to find a solution that fits this model.  It's fine with me, and I see Solar is ok with it as well so I say do it (I don't see anyone else having spoken up one way or the other, and it's taken me a few days to get to this... release week always causes time shortages).  --  Vincent Danen @ http://linsec.ca/  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
