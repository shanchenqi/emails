At its core it is a Xen permissions issue, because the host was not protecting data it mainers from guest modification. This permissions  problem impacted Xen tools themselves, and any other application which made use of xenstore - of which libvirt was one. The original proposed fix to Xen would require changes in both Xen and libvirt to fully resolve. The Xen developers eventually worked out a fix that directly addresses all users, so there is no longer any need for libvirt to be fixed. It is sufficient to apply the Xen permisions fixes, so I'd class this as primarily a Xen issue.
