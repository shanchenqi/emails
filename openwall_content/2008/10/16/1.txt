Those tools are fencing agents used by Red Hat Cluster Suite (tools that can be used by a cluster to make sure that non-responding cluster member is really down, so shared resources can be taken by some other cluster member;  they usually do so by communicating with some remote device capable of cutting the system from power, or reboot it (power switches, kvm switches, remote consoles, ...)).  In the Cluster Suite for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, they were packaged in the fence package.  Cluster Suite for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 has them in cman package (Cluster Manager).  Other vendors shipping Cluster Suite are likely to have them packaged in packages named as fence and cman, or similar, based on the version they use.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
