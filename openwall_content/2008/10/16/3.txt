Hi Steven,  Sorry for the delay. I just had a chance to look over the diff of the new release. I see that the long cmd and all the unchecked buffers I found were resolved by use of length-checked strcat functions. In addition, unsafe tempfile creation was fixed by checking for existence of existing filenames, trying a larger variety of filenames, and erroring out if there is not an empty filename. However, this fix doesn't seem complete for DoCommand where you can trick it to unlink() a file by the name of the input file mangled with the last char of "z" instead of "t" or vice versa.  The shell escape potential for DoCommand, as far as I can tell, is also not resolved.  So, bottom line is I think fixes 1 and 3 acceptably, while 2 and 4 are still unresolved.
