I usually wouldn't call it a vulnerability, either.  However, based on our analysis, the creates a Unicode string for character but the escape() for URL encoding can only cover 0 to so it seemed like something else was going on here, maybe the alert function not working.  I don't know how Javascript manages large strings, but it seems like somewhere around the "x4 += x4;" statement, you exceed multiple gigs.  So maybe the alert function isn't even being reached...  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
