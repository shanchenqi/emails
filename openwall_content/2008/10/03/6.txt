I've installed the vulnerable proftpd version from source on a linux system and was doing the following to reproduce the bug:  $ echo "open > script; python -c 'for i in print "%ssyst" % ("A"*i)' >> script $ lftp -f script &> out $ grep -iv "Unknown command \`[A]*syst'." out | wc -l 0  Furthermore, I didn't found the vulnerable lines of code in the source where the patch for the issue is based on. As well as in the actually proftpd source package the vulnerable source isn't existing.  So, I was wondering that the issue is still a *BSD issue and the description is wrong.  I am right? Or did I do a mistake?  The same problem I have for Is it also still a BSD issue?  Kind regards, Thomas.
