"[PATCH] x86: Fix broken LDT access in VMI  After investigating a JRE failure, I found this bug was introduced a long time ago, and had already managed to survive another bugfix which occurred on the same line.  The result is a total failure of the JRE due to LDT selectors not working properly.  This one took a long time to rear up because LDT usage is not very common, but the bug is quite serious.  It got introduced along with another bug, already fixed, by  This requires a CVE name. In a guest, an unprivileged user can trash the box's interrupts by calling vmi_write_ldt_entry(), which in turn, writes to idt_entry (interrupt) instead of ldt_entry (local). Take note that sys_modify_ldt() does not check for privileges.
