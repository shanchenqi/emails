Analysis:  There are two perspectives on the problem. First, one can argue that the flaw is in libvirt, because libvirt relies on untrusted data from guest VMs. Second, one can argue that the flaw is in Xen, because Xen makes it possible for guest VMs to write the untrusted data. Because the CVE request is associated with a Red Hat bug report for the libvirt product, CVE takes the first perspective.
