Many PHP-based worms wouldn't succeed without this setting.  Also, in some cases, the software requires it.  Finally, in some cases, a researcher CLAIMS register_globals is required but is erroneous (in this specific case, Secunia doesn't say register_globals is required, and they typically do this.)  register_globals might limit the applicability to environments where the admin doesn't (or can't) follow solid configuration practices, but it's still feasible.  - Steve  ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Reference: XSS in phpMyadmin Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference:  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in pmd_pdf.php in phpMyAdmin and possibly other versions including and when register_globals is enabled, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the db parameter, a different vector than and    Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
