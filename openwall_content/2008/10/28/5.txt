For lynx, there seem to be 2 obvious attack vectors:  1) User downloads tarball with bunch of htmls, with bundled malicious .mailcap file.  When user cds to the directory and runs lynx, he's owned.  2) Local social engineering attack - local attacker convinces victim to run lynx in some specially crafted local directory.  For valgrind, 1) does not seem to make much sense (or is lot less likely), as if you valgrind random binary downloaded form the net, you're already running attacker's code.  Few other differences: - valgrind behavior is known and well documented http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/manual-core.html#manual-core.defopts (lynx.cfg file comments suggested, that mailcap file is read from user's home directory, no mention of CWD)  - valgrind's behavior seems more useful and used in the wild, so not easily changeable  - you can suppress reading .valgrindrc files using --command-line-only=yes , but this option does not seem to be very well documented in commonly shipped man pages or --help output. There seem to be some man page versions that mention this option: http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/valgrind1.html  Actually, gdb may be another target with its handling of .gdbinit:     echo 'shell /usr/bin/id' > .gdbinit ; gdb  (gdb seems to have some checks in place though and refuses to open files that world-writable or not owned by the user)  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
