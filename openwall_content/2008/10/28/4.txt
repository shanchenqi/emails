I'd think this is okay as a policy for a distribution and agree that it's a  very bad idea to enable register_globals these days (afaik it should go away  in php6 anyway). But anyway a register_globals issue most likely leads to at  least some bad programming practise (using uninitalized variables), I think  it's okay to still track them.  And beside, would be worth a check but I am pretty sure there are still lot's  of webhosters out there having it enabled.   --  Hanno Bรถck		Blog:		http://www.hboeck.de/ GPG:  - ab Atomtransporte stoppen  Download attachment "signature.asc " of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
