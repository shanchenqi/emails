So the jhead changelog only acknowledges "potential string overflows".  John's comment in bug alludes to various other types of issues, but specifics are unknown.  And there are some references to other overflows that may or may not have been fixed by upstream.  So, we'd need multiple CVEs, but how many is unclear.  1 - long -cmd 2 - unsafe temp file creation 3 - "more unchecked buffers" and "unsafe buffer sized strcat's in     ModifyDescriptComment"  [this assumes that upstream only fixed     issue 1) 4 - shell escapes   Without knowing what exactly is being reported and fixed, it's pretty difficult to assign CVEs, especially with phrases like "more unchecked buffers" that could apply to anything.   Use for the "long -cmd" ONLY - and whatever other overflows the upstream developer fixed.  (That is, is focusing on what was fixed by upstream, not what's in the Ubuntu bug report).   - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
