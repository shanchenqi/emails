For there to be a vulnerability, there needs to be some "attacker" role.  The attacker can either actively force the error (as in a classic buffer overflow attack against a server), passively benefit (as in an accidental information leak), or perform some social engineering attack that has a high likelihood of succeeding for a user during typical operations (e.g. accepting a private message in an IRC client).  Some people might have very generic notions of vulnerability that include inadvertent things that trusted people do to themselves, that don't benefit any external attacker.  However, it seems that the people who think this way are operating in environments with extremely high demands for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.  The example you give demonstrates how sometimes, a plain ol' bug can be much more serious than a security issue, depending on the priorities of the victim.  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
