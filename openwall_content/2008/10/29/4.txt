Well the question is whether this should be worded as ecryptfs-setup-{private,confidential} issue, or more generic issue affecting various ecryptfs-* command line utilities, that only accept passwords as command line arguments (i.e. no interactive prompt).  So even though there's not ecryptfs-setup-* script to fix in older versions, steps done by ecryptfs-setup-* are likely to be performed by the user manually, resulting in the same risk of leak as with helper script.  Or do I miss anything?  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
