Well obviously. The attack would be convincing someone to debug an application with a testcase provided in a tarball, or to debug something in a specific directory.  If you just dumped one in /tmp on a system I use and waited a few weeks, there's a strong possibility you would pwn me.  >  > Actually, gdb may be another target with its handling of .gdbinit: >  >    echo 'shell /usr/bin/id' > .gdbinit ; gdb >  > (gdb seems to have some checks in place though and refuses to open files > that world-writable or not owned by the user) >   Of course, guess who reported that ;-) (me).  The patch to make those checks was provided by me. I'm suggesting valgrind should do the same thing.
