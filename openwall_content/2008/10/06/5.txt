Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: data-destroiny malfunction: is that a "security" issue  Hi,  Today some question arised in my mind.  Preface: I found a bug in obexftp. It has some option -G, which will download  a file and afterwards delete it. The problem is, it'll do the second step  even if the first failed. So if you have some connection problem on step 1,  your file will be gone.  In my case, as it's the internal memory of a mobile phone, it's probably  pretty much impossible to restore without some professional data rescue lab.   Now, my question: Is this a security issue? Does it deserve a CVE?  While it probably does not fit in our common sense of security issues, as in  the normal scenario, you don't have any attacker, it is still something where  users should probably be warned. And it endangers the security of one's data.  After thinking a bit more about it, I even thought that this might be feasible  for some kind of unlikely attack: An attacker could disturb the bluetooth  connection at the right time so the data connection fails.  So, thouhgts?  --  Hanno Bรถck		Blog:		http://www.hboeck.de/ GPG:  http://freiheitstattangst.de/
