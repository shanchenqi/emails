Description may also mention cman package, as those fencing agents may be bundled in fence or cman package, based on the version used.  Note: was recently assigned to fence_egenera having similar flaw.  Additionally, fence_manual / fence_ack_manual communicate via FIFO socket created in /tmp.  fence_manual creates fifo /tmp/fence_manual.fifo and waits for fence_ack_manual to write to it.  This can possibly result in the overwrite of arbitrary file.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
