"[PATCH] Don't allow splice() to files opened with O_APPEND  This is debatable, but while we're debating it, let's disallow the combination of splice and an O_APPEND destination.  It's not entirely clear what the semantics of O_APPEND should be, and POSIX apparently expects pwrite() to ignore O_APPEND, for example.  So we could make up any semantics we want, including the old ones.  But Miklos convinced me that we should at least give it some thought, and that accepting writes at arbitrary offsets is wrong at least for IS_APPEND() files (which always have O_APPEND set, even if the reverse isn't true: you can obviously have O_APPEND set on a regular file).  So disallow O_APPEND entirely for now.  I doubt anybody cares, and this way we have one less gray area to worry about."  Upstream commit:  Files opened with O_APPEND are ignored. This could allow users to bypass the append-only restriction. This probably needs a CVE name.
