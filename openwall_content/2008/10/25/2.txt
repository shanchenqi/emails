Apparantly, they are refering to the last three commits to  libs/Smarty_Compiler.class.php, [2].  However, this issue is not fixed in and I could not find a  release. I have no idea where this version information comes  from.  It might be worthwhile to check applications that bundle smarty, like  tikiwiki, gallery 2 or PEAR-PhpDocumentor.
