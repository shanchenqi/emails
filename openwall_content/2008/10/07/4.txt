We happened to SPLIT on the symlink issue versus the "can't overwrite /tmp/sabre.log" issue because fixing the symlink does not necessarily fix the other problem.  Also, if the patch introduced and others might have used that patch, these are distinct errors - someone might have fixed but not  Some more explanation is below; let me know if I'm still missing something.  I've noticed that Debian generally treats multiple different errors as a more general "insecure file creation" issue.  For CVE, we haven't figured out how to handle this.  - Steve  ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Acknowledged: yes bug-report Announced: Flaw: link Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] CVE id request: sabre Reference: Reference:  A certain Debian patch to the run scripts for sabre (aka xsabre) allows local users to delete or overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on unspecified .tmp files.   Analysis: WIKI: Message #10 in bug says "delete" whereas says "overwriting."  WIKI: It is unclear whether ".tmp files" is different from /tmp/sabre.log.  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT: in Debian bug Nico Golde set the severity to "grave," implying acknowledgement.   ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Acknowledged: unknown Announced: Flaw: other Reference:  XRunSabre in sabre (aka xsabre) relies on the ability to create /tmp/sabre.log, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (application unavailability) by creating a /tmp/sabre.log file that cannot be overwritten.   Analysis: INCLUSION: This seems to be a distinct vulnerability, although this type of vulnerability happens to accompany cases of symlink vulnerabilities that involve fixed filenames and unprivileged users.  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT: in Debian bug Nico Golde set the severity to "grave," implying acknowledgement.
