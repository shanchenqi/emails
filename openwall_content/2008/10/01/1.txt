There is a tmp file symlink attack pattern in the sabre run scripts introduced by a Debian patch to them. Given that one of the binaries has to be run as root due to svgalib requirements this might lead to overwriting root-owned files in certain use cases.  Debian Bugreport:  Patch is currently in the works so I can't offer it yet.   Could I please get a CVE id for it?   Thanks in advance, Rhonda  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
