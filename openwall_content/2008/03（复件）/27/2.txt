The same issue also exists in: aterm, tested 1.0.1 eterm, tested 0.9.4 mrxvt, tested 0.5.3 multi-aterm, tested 0.2.1 rxvt-unicode, tested 8.3 and 8.9 wterm, tested with 6.2.9  This is almost half of the terminal emulators I tried. There are  probably tons of other X applications doing this, not all with the  impact of a shell, but many allow starting other programs one way or  another.  Reading the attack vector, I would consider it a vulnerability, but  looking at the amount of programs that fall into this category, I'm  worried how many programs do this and if the low impact is really worth  fixing all of them.
