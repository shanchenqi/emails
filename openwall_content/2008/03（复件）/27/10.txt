Hi,  Sam Hovecar has created zzuf more than a year ago and posted a bunch of  samples crashing various multimedia and other apps: http://sam.zoy.org/blog/2007-01-16-exposing-file-parsing-vulnerabilities  I've done some re-testing about a year later: http://hboeck.de/archives/578-How-long-does-it-take-to-fix-a-crash-bug.html  Some are still unfixed, I recently opened some upstream bug reports: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=424333 also mentioned on http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/27243 http://bugs.xine-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=74 http://bugzilla.mplayerhq.hu/show_bug.cgi?id=1043 (gstreamer not done yet, waiting for 0.10.18 to land in gentoo)  At least the firefox issue and the still open mediaplayer crashers could have  their own CVE (if there aren't already ones for it).  --  Hanno Bรถck		Blog:		http://www.hboeck.de/ GPG: 3DBD3B20		Jabber/Mail:	hanno@...eck.de  Download attachment "signature.asc " of type "application/pgp-signature" (198 bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
