This is the kind of situation that CVE adopted the "user-assisted" term for: the user assists the attacker in his/her own demise.  > > You see the commands in the URL however so I think the > > impact of this is like sending someone a message with > > "please type rm -rf ~ in your shell" so the secunia rating > > is a bit beyond the actual impact.  Is the URL still encoded at the time it is viewed?  if so, then I don't expect a typical user to notice this equivalent of "rm -rf *":    %72%6D%20%2D%72%66%20%2A  and that's part of the "smell test" for user-assisted issues.  Current CVE desc below.  - Steve   ====================================================== Name: CVE-2008-1467 Status: Candidate URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1467 Reference: MILW0RM:5283 Reference: URL:http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/5283 Reference: BID:28362 Reference: URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/28362 Reference: FRSIRT:ADV-2008-0956 Reference: URL:http://www.frsirt.com/english/advisories/2008/0956/references Reference: SECUNIA:29489 Reference: URL:http://secunia.com/advisories/29489  ** DISPUTED **  CenterIM 4.22.3 and earlier allows user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in a URI, related to "received URLs in the message window."  NOTE: this issue has been disputed due to the user-assisted nature, since the URL must be selected and launched by the victim.
