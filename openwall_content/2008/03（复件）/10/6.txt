Christey" <coley@...re.org> Subject: Re: CVE request: dovecot unauthorized login   I wrote this up as 1.0.x instead of 1.0.11 (skip_password_check's introduction) since (perhaps) other fields could be inserted to do something bad.  ====================================================== Name: CVE-2008-1271 Status: Candidate URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1271 Reference: MLIST:[Dovecot-news] 20080309 v1.0.13 and v1.1.rc3 released Reference: URL:http://www.dovecot.org/list/dovecot-news/2008-March/000065.html Reference: MLIST:[Dovecot-news] 20080309 Security hole #6: Some passdbs allowed users to log in without a valid password Reference: URL:http://www.dovecot.org/list/dovecot-news/2008-March/000064.html  Argument injection vulnerability in Dovecot 1.0.x before 1.0.13, and 1.1.x before 1.1.rc3, when using blocking passdbs, allows remote attackers to bypass the password check via a password containing TAB characters, which are treated as argument delimiters that enable the skip_password_check field to be specified.
