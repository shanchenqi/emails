While centerim has no special URL  handler to handle incoming urls it does provide the ability  to list urls in a message by pressing F2. If you press enter  on one of these urls it tries to open it in an external  browser and executes the other commands as well.  You see the commands in the URL however so I think the  impact of this is like sending someone a message with  "please type rm -rf ~ in your shell" so the secunia rating  is a bit beyond the actual impact.
