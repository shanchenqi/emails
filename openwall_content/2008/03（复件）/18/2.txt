Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE request: bzip2 CERT-FI: 20469  Hey,  CERT-FI: 20469 [1] was released yesterday, and with it a new bzip2  release, quoting their CHANGES:  1.0.5 (10 Dec 07) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Security fix only.  Fixes CERT-FI 20469 as it applies to bzip2.   Reading the patch [2], it's missing a boundary check that can lead to an  over-read on the tt/ll heap-buffer. I'd call this a DoS, did anyone  else review?  Thanks, Robert   [1]  https://www.cert.fi/haavoittuvuudet/joint-advisory-archive-formats.html [2] https://bugs.gentoo.org/attachment.cgi?id=146488&action=view   Download attachment "signature.asc " of type "application/pgp-signature" (190 bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
