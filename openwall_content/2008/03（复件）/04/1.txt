"If the DISPLAY environment is not set, rxvt opens an xterm  on :0, which on some headless login-server means anyone can setup  an fake X server waiting for someone loggin in without X  forwarding to start rxvt by some mistake or by some program (thus  without even noticing) and getting full shell access to that other  account."  This is Debian bug 469296[0].  It should be a good idea to check other terminal emulators  as well.
