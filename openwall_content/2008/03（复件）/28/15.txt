The oCERT project is a public effort providing security handling support to Open Source projects affected by security incidents or vulnerabilities, just like national CERTs offer services for their respective countries.  If you are a small project lacking security handling resources we can aid you in tracking down the extent and nature of potential compromises and security vulnerabilities and co-ordinate with all affected parties (like projects that ship your code).  If you are a big project and/or Open Source vendor we can promptly communicate with you reports and vulnerabilities that might affect your codebase and infrastructure and help you out with your security requirements.  You can read all about the project at http://www.ocert.org.  Any feedback is appreciated.  Cheers!
