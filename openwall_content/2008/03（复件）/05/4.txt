I've just added links to your Security Auditing Tools and Automated Audit Examples pages to:  	http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/tools 	http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/links  Perhaps brief info on the tools should also be added to our tools page directly - maybe you could do that?  Also, I notice that Debian is still not on our vendors page - would you add it, please? -  	http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/vendors  Debian is already on the distro-patches page, though. :-)  Finally, are you still planning on creating an oss-security wiki page on vendor-sec, under the mailinglists namespace?  It could be as simple as copying your existing Wikipedia content onto our wiki.  It's just that I think it'd be most appropriate for you to do it.  Then others will be able to work on that page further, and the Wikipedia page could be based on ours.
