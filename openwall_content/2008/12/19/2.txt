We were checking if lc->sync is in range of kernel/tor2.c:#define MAX_TOR_CARDS 64, but then lately in the code we used:  zaptel/kernel/tor2.c:              /* if a sync src, put it in the proper place */             if (lc->sync) {                     p->tor->syncs[lc->sync - 1] = span->spanno;                     p->tor->psyncs[lc->sync - 1] = p->span + 1;             }  The problem is 'syncs/psyncs' is defined as array with only 4 items (from zaptel/kernel/tor2.c)       79 struct tor2 {      80         /* This structure exists one per card */      81         struct pci_dev *pci;            /* Pointer to PCI device */      82         int num;                        /* Which card we are */      83         int syncsrc;                    /* active sync source */      84         int syncs[SPANS_PER_CARD];      /* sync sources */      85         int psyncs[SPANS_PER_CARD];     /* span-relative sync sources */  where 'SPANS_PER_CARD' is defined as: tor2.c:#define SPANS_PER_CARD  4  so the array index would overflow.
