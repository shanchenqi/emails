Therefore, we are using as an identifier for this incomplete / incorrect fix.  This issue is specific to the previously released Ruby updates for Red Hat Enteprise Linux 4 and 5.  This is unlikely to affect anyone else that does not ship this packages based on these.  No new flaw was discovered, if you've applied correct patch, you can safely ignore this CVE.
