Thanks.  --- commit Author: Vlad Malov <Vlad.Malov@...iumnetworks.com> Date:   Tue Nov 18      MIPS: Fix potential DOS by untrusted user app.      On a 64 bit kernel if an o32 syscall was made with a syscall number less     than we would read the function from outside of the bounds of the     syscall table.  This led to non-deterministic behavior including system     crashes.      While we were at it we reworked the 32 bit version as well to use fewer     instructions.  Both 32 and 64 bit versions are use the same code now.
