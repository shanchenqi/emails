Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE request: kernel: enforce a minimum SG_IO timeout  This requires a CVE name. Please assign one. Thanks.  Alan Cox reported that libata needs to enforce sensible minimum timeouts on SG_IO requests otherwise a local, unprivileged user can trigger long spews of errors and forces the drives into PIO run as any user.  To trigger this problem, you need to be able to open the cdrom device (i.e. login as a normal user from the console and then access it via ssh) or access to /dev/sg* which is root only in all sane systems.
