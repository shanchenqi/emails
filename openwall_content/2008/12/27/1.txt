What about remote command execution via unsanitized user input?  It will work only if the server had executable triggers and 'allow_exec' is set to 1.  By the way, will be triggered ;)) only for this case too.  If anyone is interested, I had reworked the original patch at MilW0rm. Original patch was mangling results of std::string.c_str() and sanitizing not only user-supplied part, but the whole command.  The result is attached and comments are very welcome. --  Eygene  View attachment of type "text/plain" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
