Well yes, it would probably be better to have a big warning at this place, because this flag is very dangerous unless used properly and all use cases should be expressable through preg_replace_callback as well, which is hard to use improperly from a syntax point of view, as no evaluation of user-supplied data is ever going to happen. :) But I would not say that PHP or its docs are wrong because of this.  Of course you can still mess up your callback function in a way which creates issues, but this is a generic issue which might as well happen at different places in your code.   > Do you happen to know if it's safe in all cases to use '' quotes > around the capture reference?

I cannot think of a case where single quotes could be easily circumvented somehow, but I'd never claim to be perfectly right here. Upstream added a perfectly fine fix, they replaced the /e usage by preg_replace_callback, so I don't see a reason why you would want to apply a different fix.   --  Christian Hoffmann   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
