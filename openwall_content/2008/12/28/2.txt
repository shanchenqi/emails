What I'm trying to say is: The PHP way of implementing preg_replace("/$pattern/e", $expr, $subject) is something like this:    my @captures = $subject =~ /$pattern/;   if (@captures) {     $expr =~ s/\$(\d+)/quotemeta($captures[$1])/ge; # expand captures     $result = eval "$expr"; # run code   } else {     $result = $subject;   }  This means that capture contents can leak into $expr and be executed.  Perl translates     $subject =~ s/$pattern/$expr/e;  to:    BEGIN {     eval "sub {       \$0 = \$_[0];       \$1 = \$_[1];       ... # number of assignments depends on \$expr       $expr;     }";   }    if ($subject =~ /$pattern/) {     substr $subject, $-[0], $+[0] - $-[0], $2, ...);   }  Or something like that.  I can't find it in the source code, but it's possible to reveal that the replacement expression is compiled early by putting a BEGIN block into the replacement expression.
