One of our CVE analysts found a concrete case; how common it is, is another question:    www.stlinux.com/docs/manual/distribution/distribution_guide17.php shows   an example of "crw-rw-rw-" permissions for /dev/watchdog. Thus, it is   plausible that the IOCTL call is available to unprivileged users in some   or all Linux distributions. Even if these permissions are not the   default, users might reasonably decide to manually set these permissions   if they happen to do a web search for "/dev/watchdog permissions" and   find this stlinux.com page.
