It surely will cause SEGV: ----- $ cat test.c #include <stdio.h>  int main(void) {         char         int persistent_comment = 1;         char *current_time = "time";         char *host_name = "host name";         char *service_desc = "service";         char *comment_author = "author";         char *comment_data = "comment";          snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer),             "%s;%s;%d;%s;%s", current_time, host_name, service_desc,             persistent_comment, comment_author, comment_data);         return 0; } $ gcc -o test test.c $ ./test Segmentation fault: 11 (core dumped) -----  Since CGI's could dump core and core dump starvates both disk and CPU, then DoS for the HTTP server that hosts Nagios is still foreseeable. But I tend to agree that this issue is of much lower interest then the cmg.cgi's one ;))  So, probably, no CVE is really needed until someone will show how this thing can be exploited.
