Yes, that's true. however, it's not a vulnerability as it's doing read-only access, and it can't cause DoS as it's only the CGI that's affected.  > And another issue is that newline seem to be missing from the resulting > command line that was written to the cmd file.

Most people didn't notice due to the fact that Nagios reads the command-pipe input when it finds anything there instead of waiting for a newline to appear in it. It was reported that user-commands that cause more than one command to be written to the pipe were broken, so it's not a huge issue.  In short; I see no vulnerability here, and thus no need for a CVE.  --  Andreas Ericsson                   andreas.ericsson@....se OP5 AB                             www.op5.se Tel: +46                  Fax: +46  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
