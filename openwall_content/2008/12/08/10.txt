Although the v2-stable part is missing the plugins/imgssapi,imtcp,imudp part of the patch, the affected 'clearAllowedSenders' function can be found in syslogd.c    static void clearAllowedSenders (struct AllowedSenders *pAllow) {  and 'isAllowedSender' function from syslogd.c also lacks the check added by the patch:      /* check if  a sender is allowed. The root of the the allowed sender.     * list must be proveded by the caller. As such, this function can be     * used to check both UDP and TCP allowed sender lists.     * returns 1, if the sender is allowed, 0 otherwise.     * rgerhards,     */    int isAllowedSender(struct AllowedSenders *pAllowRoot, struct sockaddr *pFrom, const char *pszFromHost)    {            struct AllowedSenders *pAllow;                assert(pFrom != NULL);                                      <- no "if(setAllowRoot(&pAllowRoot, pszType) != RS_RET_OK)" from the patch            if(pAllowRoot == NULL)                    return 1; /* checking disabled, everything is valid! */  so it is highly probable, rsyslog-2.0 is also affected by this issue (checking with the developers yet).  Could you please allocate a new CVE id for this issue?
