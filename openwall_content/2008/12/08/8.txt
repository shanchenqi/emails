Hmm, this seems to be unrelated to but it may be the upstream fix for CSRF: judging by the contents of   the original patch from Tim Starling should introduce at least 'csrf' word into cgi/cmd.c.  And I am failing to find one in the latest version,    So either it was fixed in the completely different way or it is the quick fix to prevent CSRFs for the eventhandler mangling commands.  It is a bit strange that it was done after (CSRF was documented in release notes), but...  By the way, entry for speaks about as about the vulnerable to the CSRF and it is inconsistent with the release notes at   http://www.nagios.org/development/history/nagios-3x.php.  Clarifications are desperately needed ;)) --  Eygene  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
