I've chosen to anchor the CVE descriptions based on Niko Tyni's commentary in and have blended in some other comments, so hopefully we have a reasonable place to start from.  - Steve  ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Reference: Vulnerability in WireShark for DoS Attack Reference: Reference: Vulnerability in WireShark for DoS Attack Reference: Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] CVE Request -- wireshark Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference:  Wireshark and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a long SMTP request, which triggers an infinite loop.   ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Reference: CONFIRM:http://svn.easysw.com/public/cups/trunk/CHANGES-1.3.txt Reference: Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] (sort of urgent) CVE Request -- cups (repost) Reference: Reference: Reference:  Integer overflow in the _cupsImageReadPNG function in CUPS through allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a PNG image with a large height value, which bypasses a validation check and triggers a buffer overflow.   ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Reference: MLIST:[Dovecot] ManageSieve SECURITY hole: virtual users can edit scripts of other virtual users (all versions) Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference:  Directory traversal vulnerability in the ManageSieve implementation in Dovecot 1.1, and 1.2 allows remote attackers to read and modify arbitrary .sieve files via a ".."
