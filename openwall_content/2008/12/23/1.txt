Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE request: kernel: soft lockup occurs when network load is very  high  Steve, can you please assign a CVE name for the following issue:  "[NET]: Add preemption point in qdisc_run  The qdisc_run loop is currently unbounded and runs entirely in a softirq.  This is bad as it may create an unbounded softirq run.  This patch fixes this by calling need_resched and breaking out if necessary.  It also adds a break out if the jiffies value changes since that would indicate we've been transmitting for too long which starves other softirqs."  Problem is fixed upstream since  Reference:  Reproducer:  This can be triggered by an unprivileged user.
