If there's CSRF then that would be a separate issue.  If ";" is also allowed then there might be some possibilities for odd entity encodings, but I don't know if that would translate directly into XSS.  A simple, likely-incorrect example might be "&lt;" which would decode into "<" but the browser would treat it as a literal "<" instead of the start of a tag.  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
