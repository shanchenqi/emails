Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE request: kernel: watchdog: - buffer_underflow bug  Steve, here's another one that needs a CVE name. Thanks!   --- [WATCHDOG] - fix buffer_underflow bug  This fixes Bug if ibwdt_set_heartbeat(int t) is called with value 30 then the check "if ((t < 0) || (t > 30))" in ibwdt_set_heartbeat is not going to fail because t == 30, but in the loop, the check wd_times[i] > t is never going to be true because none of the wd_times are greater than the value of t (i.e. 30). So we are exiting the loop with i == -1 and therefore setting wd_margin to -1 which is wrong.
