I was under the impression that ICANN "owned" or at least "was in charge of" the allocation of IPs for the root name servers. So why couldn't they just bar (via policy, not via technical means) whoever owns the rest of the prefix that IP is in from using it?  Anyway, if the IP is in the hands of a trusted party, I'm much less concerned. That just wasn't the impression I had.  	smithj   -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =PqSd -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
