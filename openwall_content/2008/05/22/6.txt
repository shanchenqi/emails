The party isn't untrusted (they're still involved in operating the B root).  They're not a third party, either, they're the legitimate owner of that address block.  ICANN should have arranged for a longer transition period, as it was done in previous transitions (I think a few older address still respond to queries).  > It would seem that IPs formerly used by root DNS servers should > be permanently retired to prevent just this sort of thing.  There's no way to retire an IP address, especially if it is located in a network prefix that is still in production (which was a driving force behind most past root servers migrations).
