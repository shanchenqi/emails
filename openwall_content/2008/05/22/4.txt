If an admin configures deny_hosts in some fashion that vsftpd | doesn't implement correctly, that might be worthy of a CVE.  I don't think rPath treated it as such when we originally added the patch, though. It would probably be worth adding it to our other branch and pushing it upstream as a security issue.  So, yeah, I'd say it needs a CVE. Thanks.  	smithj  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =vEXX -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
