Would this not be an ideal opportunity to implement this?   Whilst I think there was a reasonable case for such features prior to the  Debian OpenSSL vulnerability being identified, I would argue that this issue  highlights the case.  Comercial SSH already has such functionality - can  anyone offer a view on how [well] it works?
