The security consequences of obscure DNS root server usage are obvious, IMHO. 	You might want to consider security updates to the bind package with an updated 	root.hint file. (Since the story is on Slashdot, it is as public as it can get; 	thus I use the regular channel for this request.)  Not sure if this warrants a CVE id.
