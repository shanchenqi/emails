Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com cc: coley@...re.org Subject: CVE assignments during May   All,  I had been hoping to make this seamless, but it's not quite working out, so: I'm in Australia at the AusCERT conference, and network connectivity is periodically dicey, plus there's the time zone difference with the US/Europe which seems to be where most CVE requesters are located.  This is affecting my responsiveness more than I'd like.  We recently hired a new person who will share some of my CNA duties, but he just started so isn't ready.  I'll arrive back in the States on May 30.  Meanwhile, I'll send off a couple more CVE reservation pools to Red Hat and Debian, who can take care of more timely assignments on this list.  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
