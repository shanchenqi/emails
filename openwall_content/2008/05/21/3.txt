Did you find any indication | to that? The advisory mentions as vulnerable, but it is also dated | February 28. The last mtr was released on April 7, but it seems to me all | changes are unrelated.  The issue was an insecure use of sprintf in split_redraw(). In uptream changed this to use snprintf, thus fixing the issue.  	smithj  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =gZQa -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
