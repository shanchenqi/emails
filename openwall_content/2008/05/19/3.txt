Yes -- in the tests I did, RSA1 and RSA keys shared the same modulus, so RSA1 is covered by the same blacklists.  is in the openssh-blacklist-extra binary package in debian.  As for other corner-cases, weren't generate-able[1] with a broken version of ssh-keygen, so I've been considering publishing an _empty_ blacklist, just so that ssh-vulnkey will report as "safe" instead of "unknown".  -Kees  [1] dsa was forced to be for a while now: $ ssh-keygen -f /tmp/foo -t dsa -b DSA keys must be bits   --  Kees Cook                                            @outflux.net  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
