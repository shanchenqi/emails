If it exists it will use it as temporary directory to mkdir  the temporary directory for vim files, v<somenumber>.  src/fileio.c:            for (i = 0; i < sizeof(tempdirs) / sizeof(char *); ++i)            {                /* expand $TMP, leave room for */                expand_env((char_u *)tempdirs[i], itmp, TEMPNAMELEN - 20);                printf("expanded %s to %s\n", tempdirs[i], itmp);                if (mch_isdir(itmp))                /* directory exists */    ....                        sprintf((char *)itmp + STRLEN(itmp), "v%ld", nr + off);    # ifndef EEXIST                        /* If mkdir() does not set errno to EEXIST, check for                         * existing file here.  There is a race condition then,                         * although it's fail-safe. */                        if (mch_stat((char *)itmp, &st) >= 0)                            continue;    # endif    #if defined(UNIX) || defined(VMS)                        /* Make sure the umask doesn't remove the executable bit.                         * "repl" has been reported to use */                        umask_save =    #endif                        r = vim_mkdir(itmp,   So it checks for $TMPDIR on your system because this  environment variable is not set and therefore can't be expanded?!  You could redirect the temporary files of a user to a  location the attacker and the victim has access to but vim  still sets the correct permissions so this does not help the  attacker. After a quick check this doesn't look like a  security issue to me.
