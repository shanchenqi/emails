Dmitry V. Levin and I have completed design of the encoding scheme, and Dmitry implemented it.  Now we have:  blacklist-encode.c - the encoder program; blacklist-check.c - the "checker" program, used for testing only; - the patch to sshd.  The patch is against an older version that we still have in Owl (with lots of other patches), but it is trivial to forward-port.  In fact, I expect that Dmitry will port it to the newer version in ALT Linux's distributions very soon (if not already).  Dmitry - please announce your forward-port in here when you have it.  Dmitry has done fairly extensive testing, but we would not mind others in the community doing more tests and reporting back in here.  We also have which is used as a "source" in our OpenSSH package.  It was generated from ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/o/openssh-blacklist/openssh-blacklist_0.3.tar.gz with:  	cat | ./blacklist-encode 6 > 	bzip2 !$  That is, it contains 48-bit partial fingerprints for and RSA and DSA keys for PID range 1 to (a total of almost keys).  The installed file size is just 1.3 MB, which corresponds to less than 4.5 bytes per fingerprint, and the .bz2 (and .rpm) is just 1.2 MB.  Lookups are very quick, and only three small portions of the file are read per lookup, for a total of under bytes of data to read (as far as sshd is concerned).  Neither the code nor the file format is specific to 48-bit partial fingerprints; it is possible to use larger ones by supplying something other than "6" (the size in bytes) on blacklist-encode's command-line. There is a safety check against even smaller values in blacklist-encode.c's main(), although if you really know what you're doing, you can go for 40-bit as well, bringing file size for the same keys to under 1 MB.  Our latest source code may be found here:  	http://cvsweb.openwall.com/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/Owl/packages/openssh/  (along with lots of other patches to OpenSSH).  The pre-encoded blacklist file may be found here:  	ftp://ftp.ru.openwall.com/pub/Owl/pool/sources/openssh/  (and on other mirrors).  I've attached current revisions of the source files and patch mentioned above.  This is to encourage community review and comments, and to enable easy quoting of relevant context (please do not overquote).  Please note that this effort was/is supported by CivicActions.  It will enable us to receive funding for and get involved in more community activities in the future if you give due credit to both Openwall and CivicActions (especially with website links) when you reuse this stuff.
