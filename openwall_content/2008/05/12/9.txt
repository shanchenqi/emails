Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com cc: wordnet@...nceton.edu Subject: Re: Multiples vulnerabilities in wordnet   I've assigned to just deal with the "overflow in a long command line" as reported for the searchwn function.  This is based on the comment in the Gentoo bug report that "I have seen that Wordnet is sometimes used as a backend in e.g. web applications," otherwise might have dismissed it as just a regular command-line overflow.  (Increasing application connectivity is making this distinction harder, though.)  If additional detailed research is performed, then other CVEs could be assigned accordingly.  - Steve  ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Reference:  Stack-based buffer overflow in the searchwn function in Wordnet 2.0, 2.1, and 3.0 might allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long command line option.  NOTE: this issue probably does not cross privilege boundaries except in cases in which Wordnet is used as a back end.
