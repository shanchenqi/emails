I think that we'll need to announce on mailing lists as well, though.  > Today we announce the Open Source Software Security community > (oss-security) an ongoing effort to manage security information in Open > Source software by building on the very collaborative foundation of the > Open Source model.

Similarly, it'd be nice to make "Open Source Software Security community (oss-security)" a hyperlink.  > If you have an interest in the Open Source security space, you are > encouraged to participate in the oss-security community by adding content > to the wiki, contributing to mailing list discussions, or joining us on IRC.  This could have hyperlinks, too - "wiki", "mailing list".  > More information can be found on the group's wiki page here: > http://oss-security.openwall.org  We could want to include this URL near the beginning of the announcement text as well - in the hyperlink I suggested or otherwise.  Also, maybe we should put this announcement text somewhere on our own wiki, where others who might want to refer to oss-security later (e.g., announce it to their local community) could pick it up?  BTW, we'll be able to have all of the hyperlinks in that version.
