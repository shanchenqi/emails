Thank you.  For tossing in an end-users view, it is also likely of wider interest since keys generated once may travel (floppy, USB stick, scp/rsync/ssh-add -L, you name it), or systems being cross-"updated" to other operating systems (into/out of Debian/Ubuntu) for instance, so it likely wouldn't hurt to forward the whole blacklisting or at least check tools upstream once everyone is happy with it.  It may take some convincing upstream maintainers to help with working around a b0rkup issue that happend by a downstream distro, but anyways, I'd like to do some sort of "ssh-vulnkey -a" on my SUSE boxen (perhaps after some sanity checks such as making sure the file being read by this tool is actually a regular file after opening it and things like that).  --  Matthias Andree  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
