I have a first draft writeup, that I'm sticking at the end of this message, and I plan to run this past the Red Hat Corporate Communications people (which is where the delay came from, they are busy people).  They have offered to add this announcement (presuming it conforms to their standards) to the Red Hat press blog, which is well read by various people in the computing press world.  This should help get a lot more attention than just sending this out to a few mailing lists.  I did however explain that whatever goes on the press blog needs to be cleared with this group first, and they completely understand.  So here is my plan.  If everyone could take a look at this writeup and add comments, then around mid next week, I'll send our changes to the Red Hat folks, then hopefully by weeks end we'll all be synced up, with something ready to go the week after.  Thanks.  -------------------- snip ----------------------------  Security, Open Source Style ----------------------------- Today we announce the Open Source Software Security community (oss-security) an ongoing effort to manage security information in Open Source software by building on the very collaborative foundation of the Open Source model.  This community was initially founded by individuals from Foresight Linux, Mandriva, Openwall, and Red Hat.  The community has since grown to include contributions from many other projects and individuals.  The computing resources are currently graciously donated by the Openwall Project. <maybe some URLs here?>  The purpose of oss-security is to encourage public discussion of security flaws, concepts, and practices in the Open Source community.  We don't want to simply be an information clearinghouse, but to encourage active participation of those interested in the ideas and practices behind keeping modern software secure.  This includes activities such as flaw discovery, understanding, reporting, and overall best practices.  If you have an interest in the Open Source security space, you are encouraged to participate in the oss-security community by adding content to the wiki, contributing to mailing list discussions, or joining us on IRC.  More information can be found on the group's wiki page here: http://oss-security.openwall.org  Thanks You. -------------------- snip ----------------------------   --      JB  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
