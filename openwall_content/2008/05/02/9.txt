Now that I think about it, you should probably mention that vendor-sec is the place to mention non-public issues. Or, at least, say that oss-security *isn't* the place.  	smithj  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =IkSh -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
