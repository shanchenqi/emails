Ah, I haven't been separating it by arch, but I can certainly do that. I've been including the "full" hashes in the Debian openssh-blacklist source package and reducing them for the final files.  I can easily split up the source blacklist files by arch and combine them during the "build".  I will probably also keep the file in PID order, and sort it during the build.  I've been interested in the pid origin just to see where in the pid list keys tend to land.  -Kees  --  Kees Cook                                            @outflux.net  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
