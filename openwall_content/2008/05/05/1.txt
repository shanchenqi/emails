Based on the feedback of Steve Christey, I've updated the third paragraph:  The purpose of oss-security is to encourage public discussion of security flaws, concepts, and practices in the Open Source community.  We don't want to simply be an information clearinghouse, or to replace any of the current security lists and groups.  The goal is to fill and existing vacuum by encouraging active participation of those interested in the ideas and unique challenges in securing Open Source software.  This includes activities such as flaw discovery, understanding, reporting, and overall best practices.  Unless someone complains, I'm going to send this text on Tuesday to the Red Hat Corporate Communications people, and setup a good date for this go public.  Thanks.  --      JB  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
