MySQL and fixes an issue allowing an authenticated attacker to gain full access to tables that will be created by another database user in the future, if an attacker can predict name of such tables (and MyISAM storage engine is used).  References:  Steve, please assign CVE id.  Thanks!   Release notes also mention following change: Security Enhancement: It was possible to force an error message of excessive length which could lead to a buffer overflow. This has been made no longer possible as a security precaution.  According to the upstream, there is currently no know exploitation vector for this issue.  Error messages are controlled by the server and it is believed that crafted messages can only by provided by modifying system files / binaries, which does not cross trust boundary.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
