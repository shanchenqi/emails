""" * Users without the "canconfirm" privilege could enter a bug as    NEW or ASSIGNED by using the XML-RPC interface.  * When viewing several bugs at once, there was a Cross-Site    Scripting hole.  * The inbound email interface allowed you to set the Reporter via    the text of the email, instead of just using the From header.
