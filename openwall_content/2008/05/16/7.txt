FWIW, the shell script in this comment is vulnerable itself, in more than one way:   For example, it lets a user have any other user's or root's authorized_keys removed, by replacing .ssh with a symlink to someone else's .ssh directory.  It's just bad practice to access users' files as root (or as another user); this is difficult to do safely.  Also, it misses authorized_keys2.  > I assume whichever version has the acceptance of the OpenSSH upstream is  > what most of us would be willing to go with. Did you discuss either  > blacklist format with them already?  Yes, very briefly.  They don't intend to implement key blacklisting.  I suspect that a worm might change this, though. ;-)  > Personally, I would like to see the feature ported to our distribution  > sooner than later, but neither at the cost of maintaining patchsets for  > the rest of existance, nor with high transition cost once upstream  > accepts another format.  Well, this is difficult to predict correctly.  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
