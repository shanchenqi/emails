Gentoo is discussing the feature in bug [1]. Until now, I have  not heard a reaction to the patch from our OpenSSH maintainers, so I  cannot judge on the technical side of the inclusion.   > I don't think we'll take the Debian/Ubuntu patch as-is.

I assume whichever version has the acceptance of the OpenSSH upstream is  what most of us would be willing to go with. Did you discuss either  blacklist format with them already?  Personally, I would like to see the feature ported to our distribution  sooner than later, but neither at the cost of maintaining patchsets for  the rest of existance, nor with high transition cost once upstream  accepts another format.
