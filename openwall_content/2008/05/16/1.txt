We are considering it for Openwall GNU/*/Linux, and if our effort would be reused by others, or if others join us in developing and/or testing the patch, this would be a reason for us to go for it.  I don't think we'll take the Debian/Ubuntu patch as-is.  Rather, we are likely to use a trivial binary encoding/compression method for the partial fingerprints.  We'd also use smaller partial fingerprints.  With the approach I have in mind, it'd take around bytes per key to store 48-bit partial fingerprints, bringing the installed file size for 3 arch types and 2 key types/sizes in under 1 MB (or just over 1 MB for 3 key types/sizes).  Please comment.  Thanks,  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
