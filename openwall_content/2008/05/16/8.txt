I agree that this might be desirable functionality, but unfortunately it has a price - we'd have to maintain two file parsers and lookup algorithms (perhaps binary and indexed, and text and sequential) or an additional program to update the binary file.  (If we only create the binary file ourselves, then that program can be a quick hack - maybe even a Perl script.)  Has there been any demand for such blacklists, prior to the Debian issue coming up?  If not, then this additional feature is probably not worth implementing right away.
