[...]  Same piece of code main-win.c doesn't look too trustworthy  to me either:          int error = jpegtran (filename, "/tmp/rot.jpg" , code);         if(error)             return error;              //now copy /tmp/rot.jpg back to the original file         char command[strlen(filename)+50]; //this should not generate buffer owerflow         // MS: didn't know, how to make it better, maybe an own copy routine         sprintf(command,"cp /tmp/rot.jpg \"%s\"",filename);         system(command);  Anyone played with crafted file names?
