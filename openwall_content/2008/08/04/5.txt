Here at Debian we currently import all CVEs into our own system,  and we use http://cve.mitre.org/data/downloads/allitems.html.gz as the source  for that.  Considering your statement we would better be using one of the XML Data feeds  from http://nvd.nist.gov/download.cfm , right? Or would you recommend another  feed (e.g. the one where NVD gets its data from)?   thanks, Thijs  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
