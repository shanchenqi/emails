I downloaded and looked at the changelog, which says:    [CON-XXX] - Some XSS/RFI Bugfixes  The XSS and RFI lines up with a post on June 14, which produced for the RFI and for the XSS.  HOWEVER, that might be just a coincidence.  Contenido says "[CON-XXX] - Additional hot- and bugfixes added" and (which is associated with those two CVEs) says "upgrade to - so according to Secunia, those two CVEs were fixed in *NOT*  Then, release says - Security fixes in cronjobs" and - Security fixes".  covers a lot of RFI issues in cronjobs, but it also covers some others.  Release also alludes to deprecating some tool scripts because they are "evil in productive environments" which sounds like security but doesn't even actually say so.  There are also older Contenido CVE's that we haven't recorded vendor fixes for, so maybe Contenido is catching up... or maybe they're getting proactive and fixing new things.  Any thoughts?  Typical CVE practice would be to split all these up based on affected version and allude to potential fixes for the existing CVEs, but that doesn't quite seem appropriate here.  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
