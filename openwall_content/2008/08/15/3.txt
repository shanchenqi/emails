The vulnerability exists due to a lack of sanitisation performed on a user-controlled integer value before the value is employed as the size argument of a memory allocation operation. An attacker may leverage this vulnerability to trigger a kernel panic on a victim's machine remotely.  This affects kernel versions since The proposed upstream commit is:  I have allocated this  Thanks, Eugene --  Eugene Teo / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
