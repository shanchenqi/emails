It's hard to read into this one since I don't know what they mean by "SSL-aware" here, or what apply_filters() is intended to do.

Presumably, only the admin would be able to install plugins.  So plugin "hiding" isn't feasible.  The admin knows which plugins were installed, unless there's some other exploit that installs the plugins, in which case there's a different vuln.  So I don't think this deserves a CVE either.  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
