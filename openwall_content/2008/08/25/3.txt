Check permissions.");     } else #endif         main_win_save( mw, file_name, type, pref.ask_before_save );           By presence of the LIBJPEG library we could without confirmation rewrite the by the symlink targeted JPEG filesystem file.  3,    Related part of the code:  void on_rotate_clockwise( GtkWidget* btn, MainWin* mw ) {     rotate_image( mw, GDK_PIXBUF_ROTATE_CLOCKWISE );     mw->rotation_angle += 90;     if(pref.auto_save_rotated){         pref.ask_before_save = FALSE;         on_save(btn,mw);         pref.ask_before_save = TRUE;     } }  Consequences: Bad enough, just think about them in context of the two previously mentioned issues.  Public mention of these issues:    Thank you in advance!
