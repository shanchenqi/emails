"[PATCH] sctp: fix potential panics in the SCTP-AUTH API.  All of the SCTP-AUTH socket options could cause a panic if the extension is disabled and the API is envoked.  Additionally, there were some additional assumptions that certain pointers would always be valid which may not always be the case."
