Hey Pınar,  I noticed Pardus is not yet listed on the 'How to steal hard work and  patches from others' page, aka:   http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/distro-patches  If you host your patches somewhere, please add a pointer there. Also, are you managing security bugs with Bugzilla, or somewhere else  where one can look up the status of an issue?
