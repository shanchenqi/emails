Those issues are fixed by the recent release, but they affect  as well and the fixes are not part of any released version in  case of 5.2.  Can we get CVEs for these please? :)   [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]  --  Christian Hoffmann   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
