No idea whether a CVE should be assigned anyway -- if it does indeed  allow for (local) code execution, that'd effectively mean bypass of  safe_mode/open_basedir. Such issues already got CVEs assigned in the  pass, so I guess this one should as well.  Local DoS only could be caused by several other means as well (infinite  recursion, ...), so if somebody could prove it that it only allows for  DoS, then there is probably no need for a CVE.
