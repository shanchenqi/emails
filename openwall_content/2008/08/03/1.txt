An OpenVPN client connecting to a malicious or compromised   server could potentially receive an "lladdr" or "iproute" configuration   directive from the server which could cause arbitrary code execution on   the client. A successful attack requires that (a) the client has agreed   to allow the server to push configuration directives to it by including   "pull" or the macro "client" in its configuration file, (b) the client   succesfully authenticates the server, (c) the server is malicious or has   been compromised and is under the control of the attacker, and (d) the   client is running a non-Windows OS.
