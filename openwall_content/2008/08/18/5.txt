The temp file will be unlinked be- 	 fore mktemp exits.  This is slightly better than mktemp(3) but 	 still introduces a race condition.  Use of this option is not en- 	 couraged.  The manual explicitly says this option is unsafe.  It should only be used when the directory in which you are making the temporary file is not writable by other users.  Furthermore, you are only using 4 X's which makes it even less safe.   - todd  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
