The worst of these vulnerabilities results in arbitrary code execution and the least, in unexpected process termination.  Five heap buffer overflows exist in parsing of real audio files, id3 tags, qt mov files, and matroska headers which all can result in arbitrary code execution.  Three additional heap buffer overflows occur in mng, mod, and real handling which are potentially exploitable.  Seven additional issues were identified in the input plugins as well as the real, qt, and matroska demuxers which result in process termination or memory corruption that may have wider implications.  The oCERT team was contacted by the Xine project requesting a review of some code changes relating to memory allocations. These vulnerabilities were the findings of this requested analysis. The full analysis text can be found in the references below.
