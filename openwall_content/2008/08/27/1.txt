Please everyone update the opensc packages in your distribution.  Those who don't want to update, but only apply the changes necessary: keep the patch I posted last time, but add this change:  Index: /trunk/src/tools/pkcs15-tool.c =================================================================== --- /trunk/src/tools/pkcs15-tool.c (revision +++ /trunk/src/tools/pkcs15-tool.c (revision @@ @@          }   -        if (strcmp("OpenSC Card",p15card->label) != 0) { -		printf("not initialized by opensc, card is fine."); -		rc = 0; -                goto end; -        } -  	/* first select file on and get fci */  	sc_format_apdu(in_card, &apdu, SC_APDU_CASE_4_SHORT, 0xa4,   Thanks.   Regards, Andreas Jellinghaus   Security update for OpenSC ==========================  OpenSC Security Advisory --------------------------------------  OpenSC initializes CardOS cards with improper access rights  This is an update to our security advisory   Chaskiel M Grundman found a security vulnerability in OpenSC. The  vulnerability has been fixed in OpenSC In Mitre's CVE dictionary this  issue is filed under Users will need to  run "pkcs15-tool -T -U" to test (-T) and update (-U) the security settings on  their card.    All versions of OpenSC prior to initialized smart cards with Siemens  CardOS M4 card operating system without proper access right: the ADMIN file  control information in the directory on the smart card was left to 00  (all access allowed).   OpenSC released July 30th was found to contain only a partial fix.  The new tool for testing and updating smart cards ("pkcs15-tool -T")  contained a too strict check - including the Card label to match "OpenSC".  Jean-Pierre Szikora found this problem: a card can be initialized with  setting any label (use "pkcs15-init --create-pkcs15 --label foobar" for  example), thus this check was too strict and had to be removed.   With this bug anyone can change a user PIN without having the PIN or PUK or  the superusers PIN or PUK. However it can not be used to figure out the PIN.  Thus if the PIN on your card is still the same you always had, then you can  be sure, that noone exploited this vulnerability.   This vulnerability affects only smart cards and usb crypto tokens based on  Siemens CardOS M4, and within that group only those that were initialized  with OpenSC.   Users of other smart cards and usb crypto tokens are not affected. Users of  Siemens CardOS M4 based smart cards and crypto tokens are not affected, if  the card was initialized with some software other than OpenSC.   The new version of OpenSC implements a simple way to verify if a card is  affected or not:  	pkcs15-tool has now two new options:          --test-update, -T             Test if the card needs a security update         --update, -U                  Update the card with a security update  Running  	pkcs15-tool -T  will either show          fci is up-to-date, card is fine  or          fci is out-of-date, card is vulnerable  If the card is vulnerable, please update the security setting using:  	pkcs15-tool -T -U this will show:          fci is out-of-date, card is vulnerable         security update applied with success.  Our Mac OS X Installer Package "SCA" is also affected by this vulnerability:  Version and earlier are vulnerable and version included the  partial fix with OpenSC only. A new version including OpenSC  will be soon available.   Our old Windows Installer Package "SCB" is also affected by this  vulnerability: All versions are affected. We don't have any windows developer  left, so right now noone can update this package. But new windows binaries  build using mingw are now available in the "Build" project. Version  includes OpenSC with the partial fix, a new version with OpenSC  will be soon available.
