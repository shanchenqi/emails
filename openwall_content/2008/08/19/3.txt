The announcement > looks like it at least fixes several Denial of Service problems: [...]  I have problems to understand why this would be a Denial of  Service. While I don't share the opinion about browser  crashes I think there are at least good arguments for both  sides.  But if swfdec crashes on playing a flash movie this  looks like an application bug. At least I wouldn't talk  about Denial of Service if vim would crash on opening a text  file.  It would be interesting what is causing this crash and if  there is underlying a more serious issue.
