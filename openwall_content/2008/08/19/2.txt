The announcement looks like it at least fixes several Denial of Service problems:   ("Mario Rush") 	MD5:  	Changes: 	- fix a crash when decoding 1x1 JPEG images 	- fix a crash in XMLSocket.send 	- fix crashes when FLV decoding was aborted 	- fix a crash in exception handling code 	- fix some infinite loops with prototype loops 	- fix crasher when handling broken dates 	- fix crashers with native constructors found in testing 	- compatibility fixes: compile with gold linker, make includes work from C++  (SUSE at least is shipping swfdec.)
