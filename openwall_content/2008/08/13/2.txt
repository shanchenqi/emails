I agree that it doesn't sound like much of an issue (and setup.php being left around sounds suspicious in itself), but we take the approach that if a vendor thinks it's important enough to issue a security advisory, we'll tag it on the assumption that vendors don't have any motivation to over-inflate the importance of a bug without some consideration of security risk.  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
