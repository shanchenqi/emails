OK, some followups:  1) for Turba, affects contact.php, which only exists in    Turba 2.2.  2) The Debian bug report seems to have found contact issues in Turba 2.1,    in browse.php:     3) The code from Turba 2.1 looks quite different than the contact.php code    as quoted by Nico here:       4) I haven't seen any mention of contact issues in Horde itself, is this    correct?  5) the "unspecified" issues based on a vague Horde    Groupware advisory, appears to line up closely with both    (obrowser) and (Turba contacts).  Is    this sufficiently confirmed?  > It seems different ids should be used for (1) and (2), as different > Horde project components are affected, also in different versions.  Difference in components is not treated as relevant for CVE purposes.  However, the different versions are.  Question 3 is especially relevant even in this case.  This might be a candidate for a SPLIT, but I'm generally reluctant to do so after a CVE has been published, since we don't know how many people are already using it...  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
