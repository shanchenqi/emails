Secunia interpreted [1] the "remotely exploitable buffer overflows"  mentioned in the changelog [2] to be a "boundary error within  the "TruncateString()" function in src/gfx.cpp". This would be the  following patch [3]. However, this would overwrite the buffer by max. 2  bytes, and does not match your bug description too well. Is this maybe  [4] ?
