The announcement mentions it too, but without specifying any implications:   The fix does not even seem to be committed in the public clamav SVN (either trunk or branch).  Does anyone have more info?  From commit message, it looks like DoS, so probably worth new id for an incomplete fix.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
