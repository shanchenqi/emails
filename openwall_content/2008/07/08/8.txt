A client need only send a DHCPREQUEST for an IP address not on the same network as dnsmasq. Eg:  1. dnsmasq listening on and giving IP addresses for 2. client requests IP address on another network, such as 3. dnsmasq (and presumably earlier) crashes  This can happen in normal operation with roaming users, but can also happen with a malicious request. Attached is a script to easily test for this (requires python scapy).
