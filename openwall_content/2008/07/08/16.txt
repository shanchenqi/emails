Based on my current read of things (perhaps faulty, and definitely without all the relevant details), is for a fundamental design problem with DNS itself, so it applies to all implementations (or "most," according to CERT... I'm afraid to ask the followup question).  CVE runs into this kind of challenge a couple times a year.  Usually it's for PROTOS-style analyses that find tons of issues in tons of implementations, where there are so many complications (and often insufficient details) that only a couple CVE's are used to identify them all.  However, when it comes to protocol design issues, it's not always clear what to do.  In this case, there's also the practical implication that the same CVE is already being used for BIND, MS, and Cisco.  So even if we realize that splitting into separate ID's would be technically correct, doing so would probably cause more headaches than it solves.  (Although as Mark Cox mentioned to me, CVSS scoring might be more problematic since we have multiple products with the same CVE.)  Unfortunately, these are limitations of CVE, especially early in the disclosure process.  By the way, I'm treating Microsoft's "DNS Cache Poisoning Vulnerability" as something that's Microsoft-specific, pending any further public details.  The bulletin doesn't seem to say anything about it being a general design problem.  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
