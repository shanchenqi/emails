Microsoft has: DNS Insufficient Socket Entropy Vulnerability - DNS Cache Poisoning Vulnerability -  Cisco has:  Question: Is CVE going to keep those two identifiers for the fundamental  issues, and load them up with affected vendors?  ---------- Forwarded message ----------   Vulnerability Note Multiple DNS implementations vulnerable to cache poisoning  Overview  Deficiencies in the DNS protocol and common DNS implementations facilitate  DNS cache poisoning attacks.  I. Description  The Domain Name System (DNS) is responsible for translating host names to  IP addresses (and vice versa) and is critical for the normal operation of  internet-connected systems. DNS cache poisoning (sometimes referred to as  cache pollution) is an attack technique that allows an attacker to  introduce forged DNS information into the cache of a caching nameserver.  DNS cache poisoning is not a new concept; in fact, there are published  articles that describe a number of inherent deficiencies in the DNS  protocol and defects in common DNS implementations that facilitate DNS  cache poisoning. The following are examples of these deficiencies and  defects:  < - >  II. Impact  An attacker with the ability to conduct a successful cache poisoning  attack can cause a nameserver's clients to contact the incorrect, and  possibly malicious, hosts for particular services. Consequently, web  traffic, email, and other important network data can be redirected to  systems under the attacker's control.  < - >   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
