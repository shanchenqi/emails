BIND's advisory sounds suspiciously similar (indeed, until you sent this email, I didn't even consider that they were different).  says "The method used makes it harder to spoof answers to a resolver by expanding the range of UDP ports from which queries are sent by the nameserver, thereby increasing the variability of parameters in outgoing queries."  My reading of the above is that since a caching nameserver would obviously cache responses received, spoofing an answer to a query is a cache poisoning attack.  Note how similar this is to "The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by... using random sockets for UDP queries..."  But, really, I don't care. This mailing list is for FOSS software, and I doubt Microsoft's DNS server qualifies ;-)  	smithj  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  2pcAnizEmlO1LSAsGCiKmWoHhQBswVfC =3wnE -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
