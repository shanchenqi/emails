So here is a start:  - posadis [1]: 	has not seen an update since dec I could not find 	any info on  port randomization etc., but considering the age it might probably have  other issues too.  - dnsmasq [2]: 	no port randomization [3]  - pdnsd [4]: 	no info yet  - MaraDNS [5]: 	"MaraDNS uses a strong secure RNG for both the query (16 bits of  entropy) and the source port of the query (12 bits of entropy). This  makes spoofing replies to a MaraDNS server more difficult, since the  attacker has only a one in million chance that a given spoofed reply  will be considered valid." [6]  - MyDNS [7]: 	"MyDNS does not include recursive name service, nor a resolver library." 	also this thread [8]  - DNRD [9]: "Uses random source port and random query ID's to prevent  cache poisoning."
