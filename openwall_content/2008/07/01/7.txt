Only a cosmetic thing though.  was mentioned since supplied a patch against  We don't always provide exhaustive lists of versions in CVE descriptions, but we do include those that seem to be most likely reported by others.  These serve as "correlators" across distinct sources.  For example, a milw0rm post might say "1.6 is affected" and the vendor might later say "1.4 through 1.9."  If we exclude the version as reported in the milw0rm post, then it produces more work for people who have to figure out whether the milw0rm post and vendor announcement are really the same issue or not.  This is a very subtle point and one that most consumers probably don't care about, but we try to do this in CVE as much as we can, since we have to deal with multiple audiences.  In this particular case, including was probably not essential and potentially confusing to some, but it was a natural consequence of the mindset that we have when we write descriptions.  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
