Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE request: condor <  Needs CVE name  leading to:   	This release fixes a problem causing possible incorrect handling of wild  	cards in authorization lists. Examples of the configuration variables that  	specify authorization lists are   	  ALLOW_WRITE  	  DENY_WRITE  	  HOSTALLOW_WRITE  	  HOSTDENY_WRITE   	If a configuration variable uses the asterisk character (*) in  	configuration variables that specify the authorization policy, it is  	advisable to upgrade. This is especially true for the use of wild cards in  	any DENY list, since this problem could result in access being allowed,  	when it should have been denied. This issue affects all previous versions  	of Condor.
