It was initially planned to not announce these fixes in public until next week.   I'm also adding the upstream packagers list to the CC so they know what's going on.  If anyone has any questions, please reply via the oss-security list.  We'll make that the primary information source to hopefully clear things up.  Thanks.  --      JB  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
