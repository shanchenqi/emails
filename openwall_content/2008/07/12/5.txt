This generator appears to be linear (but the reduction to the available port range is not).  The comment is pretty clear, too:   *      A 32 bit pseudo-random number is generated using a fast  *      algorithm suitable for simulation. This algorithm is NOT  *      considered safe for cryptographic use.  I haven't written an exploit because I'm not sure how to bypass the modulo operation.  The modulus is = 3 * 3 * by default, so it's not obvious to me how to recover the internal status without effort.
