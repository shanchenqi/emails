The vulnerability has been fixed in OpenSC In Mitre's CVE dictionary this issue is filed under Users will need to run "pkcs15-tool -T -U" to test (-T) and  update (-U) the security settings on their card.  All versions of OpenSC prior to initialized smart cards with Siemens CardOS M4 card operating system without proper access right: the ADMIN file control information in the directory on the smart card was left to 00 (all access allowed).  With this bug anyone can change a user PIN without having the PIN or PUK or the superusers PIN or PUK. However it can not be used to figure out the PIN. Thus if the PIN on your card is still the same you always had, then you can be sure, that noone exploited this vulnerability.  This vulnerability affects only smart cards and usb crypto tokens based on Siemens CardOS M4, and within that group only those that were initialized with OpenSC.  Users of other smart cards and usb crypto tokens are not affected. Users of Siemens CardOS M4 based smart cards and crypto tokens are not affected, if the card was initialized with some software other than OpenSC.  The new version of OpenSC implements a simple way to verify if a card is affected or not: 	pkcs15-tool has now two new options:   --test-update, -T             Test if the card needs a security update   --update, -U                  Update the card with a security update  Running 	pkcs15-tool -T will either show 	fci is up-to-date, card is fine or  	fci is out-off-date, card is vulnerable  If the card is vulnerable, please update the security setting using: 	pkcs15-tool -T -U this will show: 	fci is out-off-date, card is vulnerable 	security update applied with success.   Our Mac OS X Installer Package "SCA" is also affected by this vulnerability: Version and earleir are vulnerable. A new version including this fix will soon be available at 		http://www.opensc-project.org/  Our Windows Installer Package "SCB" is also affected by this vulnerability: All versions are affected. We don't have any windows developer left, so right now noone can update this package. But new windows binaries build using mingw will be soon available at 		http://www.opensc-project.org/files/build/  --cut--  attached is a patch distributions can apply instead of updating to the new  version. still users will need to run "pkcs15-tool -T -U" for all their smart  cards and usb crypto tokens (only those based on "Siemens CardOS M4" and  initialized with OpenSC), please let them know.
