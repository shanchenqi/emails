The vulnerability is present in the rc4 encryption/decryption functions. An arbitrary length string, passed as an argument in the XSL input, is incorrectly copied over a padding variable which is previously allocated with a fixed size of (RC4_KEY_LENGTH).  Aside from the heap overflow other bugs affect the code, the length of the plaintext string argument is used for computing the key length rather than the actual key and the zero-padding of the key is incorrectly computed.  A simple XML file with excessively long input can be crafted for triggering the heap overflow.  The following patch fixes the issue: http://www.ocert.org/patches/exslt_crypt.patch  Affected version:  libxslt >= <=  Fixed version:  libxslt, N/A  Credit: vulnerability report and PoC code received from Chris Evans <scarybeasts [at] gmail [dot] com>, Google Security Team.
