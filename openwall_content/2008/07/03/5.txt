There are patches with the original advisory for these two.  Has anyone had a chance to look at them to make sure they're ok?  I don't see any references to any of these issues on the pidgin website and no vendors have issued pidgin updates for these that I can see, so I'm wondering if anyone has looked at these patches (be it vendors or upstream) to determine whether or not they're sufficient and/or suitable to apply to a security update.  --  Vincent Danen @ http://linsec.ca/  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
