As has been pointed out elsewhere, the runtime (netrw.vim being part of it) updates are independently of the patches -- at the time of the release of the first advisory, the contemporary runtime had some of the vulnerabilities fixed, for example.  I'm not sure if the changes are kept track of outside of the point releases.  Since distributions generally pick whatever is current at the time of the release, is it meaningful to say x.y is vulnerable, and x.z isn't?  The runtime files are versioned and dated, so for example the first version of ftp.vim not vulnerable is version 21 of  > Steven, are you going to split / de-dupe CVE ids based on this > information and the information in my post in other thread: > > ?  You people are obviously more versed in assigning CVEs, so let me submit very humbly:  The overall issue is that up until recently Vim script did not provide any means of quoting metacharacters.  At the time of the first advisory, there were close to a thousand ``execute'' statements.   The particular vulnerabilities detailed in the advisories are examples of a more widespread tendency in the Vim code.  Should there be a separate CVE for the overall issue, alongside CVEs for the particular vulnerabilities?  From what I could find on the web this morning, I'm not sure whether this is the way CVEs are supposed to work.  There will surely be more confirmed vulnerabilities, and it would be nice to be able to point to a CVE number and say: ``This is one of the vulnerabilities under  I hope I've helped the discussion a bit.
