Let's push the world a bit towards "perfect" state ;)  - zip.vim and tar.vim (omitted in the CVE description) only seem to be shipped with vim as of vim 7.0.  6.x versions of vim do not have them and can not be used to browse .zip/.tar archives.  Affected in versions used in 7.0 and 7.1.  I don't see them in 6.4 tarball, so no sure why advisory states 6.4 is not affected.  6.3 and 6.0 were verified to be unaffected.  - netrw seems to be used as directory explorer as of vim 7.0.  However, netrw test case triggers similar problem in explorer.vim plugin used in vim 6.x versions.  So netrw test reports vulnerable for multiple versions back to 6.0 (tested on 7.1, 7.0, 6.3 and 6.0), even though different plugins are affected on 7.x and 6.x.  - All other tests affect vim versions at least back to 6.0 (tested on versions listed above).  > ====================================================== > Name: > Status: Candidate > URL: > Reference: Collection of Vulnerabilities in Fully > Patched Vim 7.1 Reference: > > Reference: Re: Collection of Vulnerabilities in > Fully Patched Vim 7.1 Reference: > > Reference: MISC:http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim.html Reference: > MLIST:[oss-security] CVE Id request: vim Reference: > >  > Vim 6.4, and other versions allows user-assisted remote > attackers to execute arbitrary commands via Vim scripts that do not > properly sanitize inputs before invoking the execute or system > functions, as demonstrated using (1) filetype.vim, (2) zipplugin, (3) > xpm.vim, (4) gzip_vim, and (5) netrw.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
