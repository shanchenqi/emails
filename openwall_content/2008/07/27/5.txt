Why didn't it solve the problem? compared to:  diff -u -p user.module --- modules/user/user.module    7 Jan   +++ modules/user/user.module    9 Jul @@ @@ function user_login_submit($form_id, $fo      // Update the user table timestamp noting user has logged in.      db_query("UPDATE {users} SET login = %d WHERE uid = %d", time(), $user->uid);   +    // Regenerate the session ID to prevent against session fixation attacks. +    sess_regenerate(); +      user_module_invoke('login', $form_values, $user);   -    sess_regenerate();      return 'user/'. $user->uid;    }  }  from looks pretty much the same. So I guess they did not include their own patch in 5.8.
