Please allocate one.  This upstream commit addressed a user triggerable DoS:  Summary: [PATCH] splice: fix bad unlock_page() in error case  If add_to_page_cache_lru() fails, the page will not be locked. But splice jumps to an error path that does a page release and unlock, causing a BUG() in unlock_page().  Reproducer: (different issue, but same reproducer)  References:  Thanks, Eugene --  Eugene Teo / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
