There have been two CVEs assigned, one for proftpd and one for  netkit-ftpd:    ProFTPD interprets long commands from an FTP client as multiple   commands, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site request   forgery (CSRF) attacks and execute arbitrary FTP commands via a long   ftp:// URI that leverages an existing session from the FTP client   implementation in a web browser.    ftpd in OpenBSD 4.3, FreeBSD 7.0, and NetBSD 4.0 interprets long   commands from an FTP client as multiple commands, which allows remote   attackers to conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks and   execute arbitrary FTP commands via a long ftp:// URI that leverages   an existing session from the FTP client implementation in a web   browser.
