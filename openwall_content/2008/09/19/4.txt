I'm not sure about this one, I'm wondering if someone else has an opinion:  It was submitted as a Fedora security update, which I'm letting through for now, as better safe than sorry.  To sum it up, it looks like the mime type used to display a given file in viewvc can be set via the URL.  Obviously this means that an attacker could force an arbitrary mime type on any file in a viewvc repository.  It strikes me as not crossing a trust boundary though, as I suspect you'd need something malicious in the repo in order for this to really be useful.  If the bad guys can already add arbitrary content, you have bigger problems.  --      JB  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
