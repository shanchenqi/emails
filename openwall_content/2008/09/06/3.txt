This allowed users to mount arbitrary sources  onto arbitrary directories; normally, they can only do so when they own  the mountpoint, and own the source, or the source is a non-local mount.  Versions through are affected. The correct behavior enforcing  these restrictions has been restored in By default, user-defined  configuration files are disabled in pam_mount.conf.xml anyway, and it is  believed that luserconf-enabled systems are not numerous, so this is  only a minor issue. It is advised to upgrade the affected systems, or as  a workaround, disable user-defined volumes by commenting out the  <luserconf ...> configuration item.   --  Hanno Bรถck		Blog:		http://www.hboeck.de/ GPG:  Download attachment "signature.asc " of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
