"When creating a file, open()/creat() allows the setgid bit to be set via the mode argument even when, due to the bsdgroups mount option or the file being created in a setgid directory, the new file's group is one which the user is not a member of.  The user can then use ftruncate() and memory-mapped I/O to turn the new file into an arbitrary binary and thus gain the privileges of this group, since these operations do not clear the setgid bit."  This bug could lead to a possible privileged information disclosure.
