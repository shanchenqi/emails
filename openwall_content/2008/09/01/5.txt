The oCERT team was contacted by Moritz Muehlenhoff from the Debian project requesting an audit of the WordNet code base. These   vulnerabilities were the findings of the requested audit.  Stack overflows fed via the command line, environment variables or WordNet library calls can result in arbitrary code execution.  Stack and heap overflows via modified WordNet dictionaries may allow   arbitrary code execution.  It should be noted that despite the ease with which arbitrary code can be executed via these WordNet flaws, unless WordNet is being used by a   daemon or web service running as a user other than that of the attacker, this is   unlikely to result in privilege escalation or the ability to take any action not   already possible as the attacking user.  The following patch fixes the issues:  Affected version:  WordNet = 3.0  Fixed version:  Princeton unfortunately lack the resources to produce a new release of   this code and will therefore not be releasing a new version as a result of   this audit.
