Applying this rule, separate id should probably be used for PyDNS [1] [2] and adns [3] as well, at they both suffer from the similar flaws - use predictable transactions ids and source port.  PyDNS should be fixed as of upstream version [4], adns issue is rather considered a design decision as documented in the INSTALL file [5].
