The basic programming error was the same regardless of where it occurred or what it affected.  - Steve  ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Reference: WordNet stack and heap overflows Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference:  Multiple buffer overflows in Princeton WordNet (wn) 3.0 allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) a long argument on the command line; a long (2) WNSEARCHDIR, (3) WNHOME, or (4) WNDBVERSION environment variable; or (5) a user-supplied dictionary (aka data file).  NOTE: since WordNet itself does not run with special privileges, this issue only crosses privilege boundaries in cases such as when WordNet is invoked as a third party component.
