This was committed in upstream kernel recently to address a regression introduced in commit  Summary: proc_do_xprt() does not check for user-side buffer size. The stack can be overwritten by reading /proc/sys/sunrpc/transports even when the length given to read() is a small value, i.e. < 38 bytes.  Upstream commit:  References/Reproducer:  It probably needs a CVE name. Agree?
