Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: Re: GNU ed heap overflow   Use with caveat.  While everything's inter-connected these days and maye ed can be invoked from some URI handler, or behind some application that passes user input to ed, I'm generally uncomfortable assigning a CVE for this type of "local issue" unless there's a reasonable usage scenario under which the application is reachable (WordNet has reasonable usage scenarios as a back end, for example).   ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Reference: MLIST:[bug-ed] Version 1.0 of GNU ed released Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference:  Heap-based buffer overflow in the strip_escapes function in signal.c in GNU ed before 1.0 allows context-dependent or user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long filename.  NOTE: since ed itself does not typically run with special privileges, this issue only crosses privilege boundaries when ed is invoked as a third-party component.
