If not, please allocate one.  This upstream commit addressed a user triggerable DoS:  Summary: [PATCH] dio: zero struct dio with kzalloc instead of manually  To avoid exposing ourselves to the risk of finding another field like .map_bh.b_state where we rely on zeroing but don't enforce it in the code. The fix uses kzalloc to zero all the struct dio rather than manually trying to track which fields we rely on being zero.
