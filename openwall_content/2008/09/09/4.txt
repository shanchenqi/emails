I'm not sure whether  MySQL upstream feels so as well. Quoting the ChangeLog:    An empty bit-string literal (b'') caused a server crash. Now the value     is parsed as an empty bit value (which is treated as an empty string   in string context or 0 in numeric context).   Bug:    ChangeLogs: *   *   *     Gentoo handles this as bug [ ].
