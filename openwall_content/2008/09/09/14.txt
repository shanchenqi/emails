The new tool for testing and updating smart cards ("pkcs15-tool -T") contained a too strict check - including the Card label to match "OpenSC". Jean-Pierre Szikora found this problem: a card can be initialized with setting any label (use "pkcs15-init --create-pkcs15 --label foobar" for example), thus this check was too strict and had to be removed.  With this bug anyone can change a user PIN without having the PIN or PUK or the superusers PIN or PUK. However it can not be used to figure out the PIN.  Thus if the PIN on your card is still the same you always had, then you can be sure, that noone exploited this vulnerability.
