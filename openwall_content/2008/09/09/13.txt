Even though the source of attack is different, the vuln type is the same.  Nico - I don't know the typical usage scenarios for gmanedit, but if the design of the configuration file allows the user to define dangerous actions (such as their own executable commands), then it's clearly not intended for external influence and wouldn't count as a vuln in my book. Still would be merged under if there's a scenario.  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
