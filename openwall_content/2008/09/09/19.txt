I share your opinion here, I'd rather see the COMMANDS thing  as an application bug as a user who doesn't read the  configuration but just uses it could also get owned with a  valid command. The only difference I see is that as far as I  understood the command is only executed after user action  while the configuration value is read without. The manpage  utf-8 conversion is the real vulnerability as it is possible  to exploit a victim by opening a crafted manpage in  gmanedit.
