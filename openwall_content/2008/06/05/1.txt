As I also pointed out in our bug [1], this only happens in two cases: (1) The interactive shell is used to run python code. (2) A python script resides inside an untrusted directory.  What I expect to be the most common use case, running python code  from /usr, or /home, is safe. Since all out-of-the-box software would  be installed in directories that are not world-writable, I am tempted  call (2) an error on the user side. Changing the behaviour of python in  this manner would also break existing programs.
