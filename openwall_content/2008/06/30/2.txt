Since upstream vsftpd  prior to allows any number of invalid attempts on the same  connection this memory leak could lead to an eventual DoS.  I've allocated  this  Upstream vsftpd changed its behaviour so that 3 (configurable)  invalid password attempts would close the connection (hence allowing  easier detection of brute forcing attacks etc), and this therefore also  stops any memory leak from leading to a DoS.  So we're going to add this  backported patch to our older vsftpd versions:  No embargo on this, the CVE only applies to other distros that are  supporting vsftpd < and have a memory leak.  We also didn't yet  chase down the root cause of the leak since it's mitigated by the patch.
