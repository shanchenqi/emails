Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: Re: CVE id request mercurial:Insufficient input  validation   Out of curiosity, what attack scenarios exist for this issue?  If an attacker has control over the patch already, then code execution on the system already seems likely.  Or is the impact mostly limited to "compile farms" and limited-access user accounts?  - Steve   ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Reference: Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] CVE id request mercurial:Insufficient input validation Reference:  Directory traversal vulnerability in patch.py in Mercurial allows user-assisted attackers to modify arbitrary files via ".."
