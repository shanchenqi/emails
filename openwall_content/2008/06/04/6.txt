[...]  Not to be argumentative, but have you installed OpenBSD lately (effectively the reference platform for OpenSSH development)? For years, its base install has run sshd by default, generated host keys at first boot, and not prompted at the console for human interaction to augment entropy for this process. I find it hard to blame this *particular* behavior on Debian (unless you're suggesting that they strong-armed OpenSSH upstream to integrate these changes on their behalf?). --  { IRL(Jeremy_Stanley); SMTP(fungi@...goth.org); IRC(fungi@....yuggoth.org#ccl); AIM(dreadazathoth); YAHOO(crawlingchaoslabs); FINGER(fungi@...goth.org); WWW(http://fungi.yuggoth.org/); }  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
