Hello guys,    the fix as mentioned at:    is reasonable. Have investigated this issue in a little deep detail. Seems it could be a problem in case when the targeted host would run / have created the L2TP tunnel, would support the Point to Point protocol with the L2TP plugin enabled and then local, unprivileged user could potentially issue an PPP command / request with too long L2TP packet to force kernel heap corruption (DoS). But as there  is no testcase / exploit available till now I am aware of, this all is only a presumption. If this would be a real problem, than hopefully only with low severity (due the special conditions / requirements that need to be satisfied to trigger this issue).  Kind regards Jan iankko Lieskovsky RH kernel Security Response Team   On Wed, at Eren TĂźrkay wrote: > On 18 Jun Wed Marcus Meissner wrote: > > A customer asks us if the following is a security problem: >  > Secunia issued an advisory for that issue.
