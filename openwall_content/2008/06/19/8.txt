At this stage, I believe that a CVE identifier is important.  Here, it serves two roles:  1) being absolutely sure we know which Firefox 3.0 issue is being discussed - which can be done if a CVE description is anchored on a particular reference or source.  2) Tracking, then eventually resolving, confusion between multiple disclosures.  Granted we don't always succeed at this, but it's a goal.  So, I've assigned for the unspecified issue being claimed by Tipping Point.  But, I've also assigned a separate for a Full-Disclosure post talking about a buffer overflow.  Typically I try to avoid creating CVEs for these - anyone could claim "I found BUG-TYPE X in product Z" and there's no way of proving things - but here, there's likely some confusion about whether the FD post is the same as ZDI's or not.  And ZDI is specifically not saying anything about that.  - Steve   ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference:  Unspecified vulnerability in Firefox 3.0 and 2.0.x has unknown impact and remote attack vectors, aka   ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Reference: Coming soon : Firefox 3 Release overflow Reference: Reference: Reference:  Buffer overflow in Firefox 3.0 and 2.0.x has unknown impact and attack vectors.
