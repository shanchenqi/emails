(T1_New_Parser, T1_Get_Private_Dict): Make `size' unsigned.           * src/base/ftstream.c (FT_Stream_Skip): Reject negative values.           * src/type1/t1load.c (parse_blend_design_positions): Check `n_axis'         for sane value.         Fix typo.           * src/psaux/psobjs.c (ps_table_add): Check `idx' correctly.           * src/truetype/ttinterp (Ins_SHC): Use BOUNDS() to check         `last_point'.           * src/sfnt/ttload.c (tt_face_load_max_profile): Limit         `maxTwilightPoints'.  I'll attach the patch (with comment changes stripped).  --      JB   View attachment "freetype.patch" of type "text/plain" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
