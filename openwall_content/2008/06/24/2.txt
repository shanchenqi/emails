Thanks. I do not have a deeper understanding of the issue in question,  but the upstream bug report at bugs.php.net quotes a mail from a  c-client developer, which says that the abort() will most likely not  catch all possible buffer overflows, and as such allow for the buffer to  overflow. So, according to the information from the bug, this issue might not only  allow for DoS but possibly for code execution as well, at least this is  what it looks like to me. Maybe you did further investigation and found it to be exploitable as a  DoS only, but if this is not the case the description of the CVE entry  should be clarified, in my opinion.  Also, I'm not quote sure why you are explicitily mentioning To me  it looks like all versions of php are affected, so in my opinion this  looks a bit confusing. Only a cosmetic thing though.  --  Christian Hoffmann   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
