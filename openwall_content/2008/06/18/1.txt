Hi folks,  A customer asks us if the following is a security problem:   -- l2tp: Fix potential memory corruption in pppol2tp_recvmsg()      This patch fixes a potential memory corruption in     pppol2tp_recvmsg(). If skb->len is bigger than the caller's buffer     length, memcpy_toiovec() will go into unintialized data on the kernel     heap, interpret it as an iovec and start modifying memory.      The fix is to change the memcpy_toiovec() call to     skb_copy_datagram_iovec() so that paged packets (rare for PPPOL2TP)     are handled properly. Also check that the caller's buffer is big     enough for the data and set the MSG_TRUNC flag if it is not so.
