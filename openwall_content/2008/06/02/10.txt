I wholeheartedly agree. Announcements of this kind belong on bugtraq/FD or per-software announce lists like nmap-announce. I think this list is, or should be, for discussion only. If the post isn't designed to spark discussion (other than "does this belong here" discussion :-) it should be somewhere else.  Announcements are intended either for existing end-users or as a PR ploy. Existing users are probably subscribed to the project-specific list (or don't care) and this isn't the place for PR.  So, was this message, and "SQL_injection detection tool released" held for moderation? If so, why were they approved? Presumably whoever did so has some reason not-yet-mentioned, since the SQL_injection one didn't contain a query about testing and code review.  If they were not held for moderation, why not? I thought everything not coming from a limited whitelist of people was held...  	smithj  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =GjEo -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
