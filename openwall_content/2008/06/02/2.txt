Due to the mass-hacks during the last months we just wanted to know if probably our webservers got hacked through sql_injections (although reports mostly  speak about MSSQL/ASP), so this check is based upon a regex for /[a-zA-Z0-9].js but might be extended via words-lists  freshmeat: http://freshmeat.net/projects/check_websites/ sourceforge:  We'd like to discuss file-based scanning vs remote-scanning  via htdig or other web-crawlers, since we do that too with our websites.     from the README:  check_websites is a program to basically check a webser_document_root, webserver_logfiles and sql_dumps against possible hackings. so it does not prevent you from creating safe code (see links), but if you are an administrator of a web/applicationserver  you might want to know if some of your customers have  already_hacked applications running, spreading virsues and exploits all over the planet. this suite will not protect your webserver but you might be able to check if you already have been attacked and hacked.
