I don't really mind about announces either, only about  quadrupled ones because of cross-posting :)  [...]  > Do we have people like the security-audit activists of late in > here?

At least for Debian there is an audit project  (http://www.debian.org/security/audit/) which is not really  active anymore though. As far as I know Gentoo has a similar  project.
