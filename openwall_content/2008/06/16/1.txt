You're right, but I'm sorry to say there is no estimated release date - it's "as soon as it's ready", and the official patches are part of the advisories, taken from the SVN repository - and beyond that are what distributors usually ask for. fetchmail is, in spite of its widespread use, effectively a one-man spare-time show.  Impeding the release, there are some nasty bugs that aren't security relevant which are pending the fix, but are hard to debug.  --  Matthias Andree  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
