The authentication code reads the length to be checked from sender input, this allows the sender to supply single byte HMAC code and have a 1 in chance of matching the correct HMAC and authenticating, as only the first byte will be checked. The sender would need to know a valid username.  Currently Net-SNMP and UCD-SNMP are known to be vulnerable, other SNMP implementations may also be affected. The eCos project includes code derived from UCD-SNMP and is therefore also affected.  Affected version:  Net-SNMP <= <= <= UCD-SNMP, all versions eCos, all versions  Fixed version:  Net-SNMP >= >= >= UCD-SNMP, N/A eCos, N/A  Credit: this issue was reported by CERT/CC, it is tracked as  CVE:  Timeline: CERT/CC reports to oCERT requesting joint coordination contacted affected vendors added eCos to affected packages patched net-snmp packages released advisory release  References:  Links: http://www.net-snmp.org http://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/ucd-snmp http://ecos.sourceware.org  Permalink:  --  Andrea Barisani |                Founder & Project Coordinator           oCERT | Open Source Computer Emergency Response Team  <lcars@...rt.org>                         http://www.ocert.org  02CD CE7F AC3F DA47 9B9E         "Pluralitas non est ponenda sine necessitate"  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
