This severe vulnerability affects all modules.     * Information disclosure in album-select module - Fixed exposure of album  titles through the album-select module when a guest would add a new album to  a hidden album.     * Permission escalation through zip archive extraction - No longer  creating sub-albums when adding items from a zip archive if the active user  does not have the necessary permission to do so.     * Information disclosure through embed.php - embed.php is no longer  susceptible to spoofing the remote address and thus no longer discloses the  local filesystem path of the Gallery 2 installation folder.     * View permissions not enforced for password protected items - No longer  offering the option to protect non-album items directly and only offering the  feature for albums since full protection only applies to the items within the  album.  --  Hanno Bรถck		Blog:		http://www.hboeck.de/ GPG:  Download attachment "signature.asc " of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
