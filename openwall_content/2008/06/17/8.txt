We didn't treat it as security, because it occurs in a non-default config (MailFollowURLs), it is not externally controllable, and it occurs rarely (so far we got 2 reports of this bug).  >  > Edwin, could you please inform us about important vulnerabilities/security  > flaws fixed in  I recommend to use however if you want to backport parts of it, these are the most important (from the ChangeLog). The daily.cfg and dconf changes are important for turning off vulnerable modules, the rest is self explanatory.
