I setup the Debian security audit project with the intention that  people would volunteer to do this.  I guess I found issues of  pretty low severity in my stint, and had hoped to find more.    The specific problem at the time the audit was started was that  very few people had the time, the skills, and the motivation to  join in and help.    Optimistically if there were people volunteering here I'd be willing  to spend more of my time on that kind of work myself.  Pessimistically  people find the work time-consuming and difficult.  Without a few big  holes found early on many many people lose interest.    (Me personally I found my time was taken up with other issues, and  from memory the most prolific auditors that I managed to hook up with  managed to get jobs in the security field and so they started auditing  behind closed doors - at least one person told me he was no longer  allowed to take part in public audits.  Understandable, but  frustrating.)  > I find it highly unlikely that anyone, even > the kind of people I mentioned above, would bother downloading a tarball > of something they had never heard of to do a security audit of it - > unless this is paid work.    Indeed.    My initial aim was to divide the Debian archive into "high" and "low"  risk packages and then only look at the high-risk ones.  (Where  high-risk meant setuid/setgid or network accessible.)    Random programs that people point me at aren't terribly interesting  *unless* I happen to use them myself! ;)  > Now, do any/all of you find my posting appropriate? ;-)    Yes!    One interesting recent development I was watching was the google  audits. I know nothing of the details, but I do recall that several  issues were reported to vendor sec with a "google audit" "ownership".
