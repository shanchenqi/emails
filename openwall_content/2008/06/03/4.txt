Also, there are not that many security tool announcements on Bugtraq. I think that people are often too shy to announce on Bugtraq.  This is another reason why I think there's room for a new list, but before one is created, we could simply let the announcements to be sent in here, regardless of whether they're cross-posted or not.  If this works, then create the list.  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
