I don't think so, no. I actually gave up on FD recently as well, given the ever-decreasing signal-to-noise ratio.  I should clarify; I don't actually mind cross-posting, so long as the content is appropriate on all the lists posted to. I just don't, personally, believe announcements should be on-topic on oss-security.  | Maybe.  However, many topics are valid on Bugtraq - not only Open Source | ones.  I imagine that someone could be interested in security tool | announcements relevant to Open Source software only.  Also, Bugtraq is | so large that few of us would dare to bother its readers with | announcements of new versions of a tool, even fairly major ones.  Maybe part of the problem is that I'm not that interested in new tools. The ones I currently have work well enough, and I can only spend so much effort learning new stuff, and there are more interesting new stuff to learn :)  | Maybe we need to setup a new oss-sectools list, but I'd rather not go | for it until we start to receive a substantial number of security tool | announcements in here.  Sounds good.  | As to "sparking discussion", it is impossible to know that in advance. | Yes, you wrote "designed to ..." - does ending a post with "comments, | please?" qualify?  If so, that could be used on any announcement - even | on a mostly-PR one.  Eh. I'd still lean "no" here. It doesn't seem very likely that "new version of $my_package released with shiny new stuff" is going to generate useful discussion. If, on the other hand, the author of the tool emails the list asking for comments on a new method of vulnerability scanning or similar, which may have been recently added to his/her toolkit, that seems quite germane.  | Also, what about those CVE requests - is a single response, assigning | the CVE number, "discussion"?  OK, in some cases people actually have | comments.  Good point. CVE assignments to oss software clearly belong on-list since they help us all by not duplicating work, even if they aren't strictly discussion.  | Of the existing lists, Bugtraq is probably the place for PR.  Agreed.  | However, some tools could be of specific relevance to oss-security | members - e.g., source code analysis tools and fuzzers.  Do you agree?  Sure.  | Is a moderator supposed to decide whether or not this is the case?  Well, I'm not sure. Not being a moderator, I don't know how much work it really is. *If* it is a relatively low workload, I think weeding out the not-as-relevant announces would be very valuable.  |> So, was this message, and "SQL_injection detection tool released" held |> for moderation? | | Yes, they were.  Good to know.  | I don't regret approving these messages - I think that we're having | useful discussion as a result, and I think that it was important for | this group's members to be aware of what was coming to the list (except | for spam).  Let's say that these two messages are "samples" of content | that we might or might not want in here. | | My opinion is that moderators are not supposed to define the list's | policy on their own - and we did not (and still do not) have this bit of | policy fully defined.  So let's try to take care of that now, or I would | not know what to do if more messages like these two arrive to the list.  Agreed. I wasn't intending to pass judgment on the moderators, just wondering.  For now, I'll concede that there isn't enough traffic to justify forming a new list. Consequently, I suppose I'm in favor of keeping them on-list. When/if the announcement traffic level changes, perhaps we should revisit.  	smithj  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =4j4N -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
