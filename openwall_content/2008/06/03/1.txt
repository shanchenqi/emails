Others may beg to  When I said "should not implement proprietary stuff" it was not meant that they are actually doing it today. Rather I acknowledged that it indeed meets the RFC quite well.  Blacklisting certain keys is probably not against the RFC, but it would be better to specify such additional security measurement in the RFC as well. Especially the point in time when it has to happen. I'd prefer blacklisting before the key is checked against the authorized_hosts file.
