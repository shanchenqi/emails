I don't think there's a need to setup such a project "formally", under its own name or whatever, before it is started.  Instead, if there are people to work on this, they are more than welcome to use this mailing list and the oss-security wiki for it (we even have a wiki namespace pre-created).  If we ever get to the point where this needs to be separated, that won't be hard to do.
