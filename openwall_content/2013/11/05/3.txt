TLS with PFC is  structured in a way that PFS does not unconditionally enhance security.    Without PFC, part of the session key handshake is encrypted to the  server's public key.  With PFC, the entire DH handshake is unencrypted,  and the server signs its part.  This means that a potential attacker  gains another angle, targeting the DH handshake, and it also shifts the  picture somewhat as far as the server's public key operation is  concerned (decryption vs signing).  There is also the possibility that  the asymmetric protection of the DH handshake is insufficient.  (In this  discussion, I'm ignoring DSA server certificates in this discussion  because they are so rare.)  In short, I think it's fairly likely that PFS cipher suites offer weaker  security compared to their non-PFS counterparts.  I suspect most PFS's  attractiveness stems from its spelled-out name, not its actual technical  merits in the context of TLS.  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
