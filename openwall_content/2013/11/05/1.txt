Report and patch: http://code.google.com/p/drupalauth/issues/detail?id=9  (Note that this is an independently developed module not part of the simpleSAMLphp core distribution. Note also that this module is used for Drupal as an authentication source, and is not related to using Drupal with simpleSAMLphp as an SP).   Cheers, Thijs  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
