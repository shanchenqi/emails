This bug was fixed in libxslt with this commit:  commit Author: Martin <gzlist@...glemail.com> Date:   Wed Sep 16      Crash compiling stylesheet with DTD      * libxslt/xslt.c: when a stylesheet embbeds a DTD the compilation       process could get seriously wrong  Crash as a xmlDtd struct is accessed as a xmlNode, not really attacker controllable I would say, but a denial of service (crash).
