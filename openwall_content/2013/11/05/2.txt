Also the latest Safari versions support TLS1.2 (this itself doesn't mitigate BEAST on TLS1.0 connections, yes...)   I didn't mention this in my first post: this is not only about setting a default cipher suite in a new software, but also about what I propose to dist maintainers to backport.  So in my case (lighttpd SNI bug) I could add "HIGH:!aNULL@...ENGTH" as default cipher string in the patch fixing the SNI bug. Do you who voted so fast for dropping MEDIUM also vote for backporting such change to all long term support dists?  In this case I think it would be better if instead openssl gets fixed to use "HIGH:!aNULL@...ENGTH" as default (including backporting this fix), fixing all applications using openssl at once.   regards, Stefan  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
