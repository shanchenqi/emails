The issues were found in the write handler of the procfs entry created by the driver, which by default is readable and writeable to users without any specific privileges.  ---------------------- When processing data written to the procfs file, the Goodix touchscreen driver is using user space supplied content as length values in subsequent memory manipulation operations without bounds checking. This can lead to multiple memory corruption issues. An application with access to the respective file can use this flaw to, e.g., elevate privileges.  Access Vector: local Security Risk: high Vulnerability: CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation)  ----------------------- When processing arguments passed to the procfs write handler of the Goodix touchscreen driver, user space data is copied to a global variable and used without a mutual-exclusion mechanism. The global structure used by the procfs write handler can be accessed concurrently by more than one process. This would allow local attackers to bypass the input validation checks (such as introduced by the fix for An application with access to the respective file can use this flaw to, e.g., alter the internal state of the handler, bypass security checks, or create a denial-of-service condition.  Access Vector: local Security Risk: medium Vulnerability: (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization)  Affected versions All Android releases from CAF using a Linux kernel from the following heads:  jb_3* Patch We advise customers to apply the following patches:  Acknowledgement ============= Qualcomm Innovation Center, Inc.
