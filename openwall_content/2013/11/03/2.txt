In order to ensure full traceability, we need a CVE number assigned that we can attach to further notifications. This issue is already public, although an advisory was not sent yet.  Title: XenAPI security groups not kept through migrate or resize Reporter: Chris Behrens (Rackspace) and Vangelis Tasoulas Products: Nova Affects: Folsom, Grizzly  Description: Chris Behrens with Rackspace and Vangelis Tasoulas reported a set of vulnerabilities in OpenStack Nova. When migrating or resizing an instance, including live migration, existing security groups may not be reapplied after the operation completes. This can lead to unintentional network exposure for virtual machines. Only setups using the XenAPI backend are affected.
