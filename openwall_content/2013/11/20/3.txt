Retaining stale TLB entries could allow guests access to memory that ought to have been revoked, or grant greater access than intended.  IMPACT ======  Malicious guest administrators might be able to cause host-wide denial of service, or escalate their privilege to that of the host.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen 4.2.x and later are vulnerable. Xen 4.1.x and earlier are not vulnerable.  Only systems using Intel VT-d for PCI passthrough are vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  This issue can be avoided by not assigning PCI devices to untrusted guests on systems supporting Intel VT-d.  NOTE REGARDING LACK OF EMBARGO ==============================  This issue was disclosed publicly on the xen-devel mailing list.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.  xsa78.patch        Xen 4.2.x, Xen 4.3.x, xen-unstable  $ xsa78*.patch  xsa78.patch $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =wrTD -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment "xsa78.patch" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
