In order to ensure full traceability, we need a CVE number assigned that we can attach to further notifications. This issue is already public, although an advisory was not sent yet.  """ Title: Ceilometer DB2/MongoDB backend password leak Reporter: Eric Brown (IBM) Products: Ceilometer Affects: All supported versions  Description: Eric Brown from IBM reported an information leak in Ceilometer logs. The password for the DB2 or MongoDB backends was logged at INFO level in the ceilometer-api logs. An attacker with access to the logs (local shell, log aggregation system access, or accidental leak) may leverage this vulnerability to elevate privileges and gain direct full access to the Ceilometer backend. Only Ceilometer setups using the DB2 or MongoDB backends are affected.
