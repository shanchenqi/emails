Debian bug report:     Background of the bug:     The cause of the bug is in ath9k_htc_set_bssid_mask [1]. Here the MAC address of one of the virtual interfaces should be picked as the new main MAC address of the device. However the main MAC address (stored in common->macaddr) is never updated. The ath9k does implement this properly and sets the main MAC address to the MAC address of one of the virtual interfaces (by first writing it to iter_data->hw_macaddr and then copying it over to common->macaddr [2]). Note that ath_hw_setbssidmask updates the main MAC address register for both the ath9k and ath9k_htc drivers [3].     Can a CVE please be assigned?
