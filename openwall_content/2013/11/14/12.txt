A FakeBasicAuth authentication bypass issue was reported for mod_nss some time ago:   The issue was fixed in upstream git:   but there was no new release of mod_nss since to include the fix.  The issue now got assigned.  Note that the fix changes the user name that needs to be specified in htpasswd when using FakeBasicAuth.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
