The  content can be found at:  * http://labs.portcullis.co.uk/presentations/i-miss-lsd/  The take home points around the System V shared memory issues (detailed in  more detail in the linked to paper) are:  * System V shared memory is often created with weak permissions. * Usage of System V shared memory by X11 applications is particularly  problematic. * Qt Project patched Qt APIs Oracle patched Java JRE Google patched Chrome independently. * No progress has been made on the problem more generally by either Red Hat or Debian. * Coccinelle is an effective tool for performing static analysis on large  corpuses of C. * Memory corruption attacks against System V shared memory are unlikely.  I've also released a tool called smaSHeM (again linked to) for dumping System  V shared memory and for manipulating it.
