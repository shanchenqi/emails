We already paid our money and as far as I know we have no recourse? We can buy "not that vendor" but all the vendors do this, simple economics, you paid for it, why would I spend money supporting it? Especially when that model is no longer being manufactured. Especially when my customers appear to have no expectation that I'll support it?  This is why I bought a "dumb" TV. And why I won't get a carrier controlled Android phone ever (they have a less then perfect upgrade track record). But most people are not crazy and paranoid like me.  > To an extent, even security engineers are acting as enablers, > allowing obsolete software/protocols/cipher suites to live far > longer than they should have.  We can't force stuff to die, and I bet those security engineers usually lose to managers talking about margins and such.  > "LTS", "ESR", and not EOL'ing Windows XP 4+ years ago is a > significant part of the problem.  I can't speak to that, even if we support OpenSSL/whatever long term that's only the tip of the proverbial ice berg. The supply chain for this stuff is _deep_.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  Bq0PRSTYZPP/PvNlrVS4 =wdou -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
