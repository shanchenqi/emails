Compatibility, for example HTTPS, you can disable a lot but if you only allowed one cipher chances are a good chunk of clients wouldn't be able to connect. There's a LOT of software out there, some open source, some commercial, some written in house, it all uses encryption and signing (usually wrongly, sigh) and a lot of it cannot or will not be updated any time soon, if at all. Think of all the devices that act as a web client and will never have TLS 1.2 support (e.g. "smart" TVs) for example. Would I prefer the world to ditch SSL, TLS 1.0 and 1.1 and move to TLS 1.2 entirely? Of course. Is it going to happen? Not for a loooong time.  Think of all the things that currently use (often older versions of) OpenSSL/PolarSSL/GnuTLS/etc and will never get updated...  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  X7CpLJdIcrmYZ1OMqsP+ =hAuj -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
