NOTE REGARDING LACK OF EMBARGO ==============================  While the response to this issue was being prepared by the security team, the bug was independently discovered by a third party who publicly disclosed it without realising the security impact.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The locks page_alloc_lock and grant_table.lock are not always taken in the same order.  This opens the possibility of deadlock.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest administrator can deny service to the entire host.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen versions going back to at least Xen 3.2 are vulnerable.  To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must have control of more than one vcpu, either by controlling a malicious multi-vcpu guest, or by controlling more than one guest.  MITIGATION ==========  There is no practical mitigation for this issue.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Coverity Scan and diagnosed by Andrew Cooper.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.     Xen 4.3.x, xen-unstable             Xen 4.2.x             Xen 4.1.x  $ xsa73*.patch    $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =RHfD -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
