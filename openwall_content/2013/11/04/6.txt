I also couldn't find a sane recommendation from upstream openssl to use as default, as "DEFAULT" obviously is not a good choice. (I also don't see any reason why "DEFAULT" includes export and "LOW" ciphers...)  Is 'DEFAULT@...ENGTH:!LOW:!EXP' (should be similar to 'HIGH:MEDIUM:!aNULL') a reasonably default?  I don't want to enforce PFS or break compatibility on purpose; so I think the default could be a little bit less "secure" than what I would actually recommend to use.  So I'm not interested in how to get a super extra secure cipher set (there are many cipher strings in the wild by various folks for that), but more in a reasonable lower bound.  regards, Stefan  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
