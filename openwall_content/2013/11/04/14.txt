This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier  Versions affected: 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 6.0, 6.1, 6.2  Not affected: 5.1 and earlier  Fixed Versions:  Impact - --- The Grit gem which serves as the Git backend for GitLab has an unsafe code path for internal use which allows strings to be evaluated by the Bourne shell. In affected versions, the GitLab code search feature exposes this unsafe code path to user input from the search box. Code search in GitLab is only available for authenticated users.  All users running an affected release should upgrade immediately or disable code search using the workaround below.  Releases - --- The and releases are available from https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce .  Workarounds - --- If you are unable to upgrade, you can disable code search by deleting the following line from `app/contexts/search_context.rb` and restarting GitLab:  result[:blobs] = project.repository.search_files(query, params[:repository_ref]) unless project.empty_repo?  Credits - --- Thanks to joernchen of http://www.phenoelit.org/ for reporting the vulnerability to us.  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Comment: GPGTools - https://gpgtools.org  =ds23 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----   Best regards,  Jacob Vosmaer GitLab.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
