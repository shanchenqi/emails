RC4 is just as broken, if not broken worse than other cryptographic algorithms. I recommend you check out Matthew Green's blog:  If you search around, you can find similar stories of problems with RC4 (like this one from Qualys:  )  Mike  On Mon, Nov 4, at AM, Stefan Bühler <stbuehler@...httpd.net> wrote: > On Mon, 4 Nov > Hanno Böck <hanno@...eck.de> wrote: > >> On Mon, 4 Nov >> Stefan Bühler <stbuehler@...httpd.net> wrote: >> >> > Is 'DEFAULT@...ENGTH:!LOW:!EXP' (should >> > be similar to 'HIGH:MEDIUM:!aNULL') a reasonably default? >> >> SSLCipherSuite HIGH:!MEDIUM:!LOW:!aNULL@...ENGTH >> should be fine.
