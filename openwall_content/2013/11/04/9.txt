SSLCipherSuite HIGH:!MEDIUM:!LOW:!aNULL@...ENGTH should be fine. There are basically near zero browsers out there that should have any problems with that. Even dinosaurs like IE6 can work with this, you don't need "medium" ciphers as long as you don't want to make a site accessible to browser museums.  And looking at what medium includes that high doesn't, it seems you really don't want that ancient cipher suites: -DHE-RSA-SEED-SHA -DHE-DSS-SEED-SHA -SEED-SHA -IDEA-CBC-SHA -IDEA-CBC-MD5 -RC2-CBC-MD5 -ECDHE-RSA-RC4-SHA -ECDHE-ECDSA-RC4-SHA -ECDH-RSA-RC4-SHA -ECDH-ECDSA-RC4-SHA -RC4-SHA -RC4-MD5 -RC4-MD5 -PSK-RC4-SHA   --  Hanno Böck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
