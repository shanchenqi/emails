More details are available at:  Please note that the patch is not final yet, and can't be found in SVN.  We're still discussing: * whether other options should work in SNI context (we could   add all ssl.ca-files to all SSL_CTX instances) * whether to set a default ssl.cipher-list, and which string to pick  regards, Stefan  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
