Percona folks acquired it a while  ago.     # yum info maatkit.noarch  I'm not sure if maatkit includes tools from Percona Toolkit too.  -- Prasad J Pandit / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
