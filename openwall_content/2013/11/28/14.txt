Otherwise traceroute is broken:   I found other leaks in non-inet protocols:   The protocols where I did remove msg_namelen = 0 where actually safe. Some of the protocols I did not touch could leak up to bytes of uninitialized data from the stack.  Hardening against out-of-bounds writes:  Also there is a small 2-bytes memory leak in extended error reporting:  Greetings,    Hannes   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
