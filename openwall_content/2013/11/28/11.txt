Due to incorrect use of strncmp() in the parser for this file, however, it would allow clients to connect so long as their IP address in ASCII representation would start with something in the ACL file; e.g., would be allowed if was listed.  I'd like a CVE id for this.  Thanks,  --  This end should point toward the ground if you want to go to space.
