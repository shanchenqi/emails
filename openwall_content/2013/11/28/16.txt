Is this intended?  We have been using this URL scheme for our advisories for the better part of 2 years now, and as we publish advisories via mailing lists and several sites import our advisories, we have no way to retroactively change most of the links. If the change was intended, could you at least have the 'old' URLs reply with a permanent redirect to a new, valid URL?
