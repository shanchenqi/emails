The backlog is stored in a  database shared by all users on a Quassel core, tagged with a user ID.  However, some SQL queries didn't check for the correct user ID being provided.  This has the undesired effect that the Quassel core can be tricked into  providing the backlog for an IRC channel or query that does not belong to the  user session requesting it. Doing this requires a manipulated client sending  appropriately crafted requests to the core. This client also needs to be  properly authenticated, i.e. to have supplied valid user credentials for one  of the users on the core.  Credit for finding this issue goes to Andrew Hampe.  Fix [1] has been released in [2].  This patch can be cleanly applied to any version starting from and  easily backported to even older versions by adapting the schema version  number.
