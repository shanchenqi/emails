The hypervisor would try to use internal state which is not set up unless nested virtualization is actually enabled for a guest.  IMPACT ======  A malicious or misbehaved HVM guest, including malicious or misbehaved user mode code run in the guest, might be able to crash the host.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen 4.2.x and later are vulnerable. Xen 4.1.x and earlier are not vulnerable.  Only HVM guests run on VMX capable (e.g. Intel) hardware can take advantage of this vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only PV guests, or running HVM guests on SVM capable (e.g. AMD) hardware will avoid this issue.  Enabling nested virtualization for a HVM guest running on VMX capable hardware would also allow avoiding the issue.  However this functionality is still considered experimental, and is not covered by security support from the Xen Project security team.  This approach is therefore not recommended for use in production.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Jeff Zimmerman.  NOTE REGARDING LACK OF EMBARGO ==============================  This issue was disclosed publicly on the xen-devel mailing list.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.     Xen 4.3.x, xen-unstable             Xen 4.2.x  $ xsa75*.patch   $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =gTUt -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
