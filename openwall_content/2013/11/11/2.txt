This issue was fixed in gitlab-shell so users who updated gitlab-shell after [our recent security are not affected.  # Remote code execution vulnerability in the repository import feature of older versions of GitLab  There is a remote code execution vulnerability in the repository import feature of older versions of GitLab. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier  Versions affected: 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 6.0, 6.1, 6.2  Not affected: 4.2 and earlier  Fixed versions: Community Edition Enterprise Edition (all using gitlab-shell  ### Impact When creating a new project a GitLab user can specify that a remote repository should be imported into the new project. In affected versions the import URL text field can be used to execute code on the GitLab server. Only authenticated users can create new projects and import repositories.  This vulnerability was fixed in gitlab-shell All users running GitLab 5.4 or newer should verify that they are using gitlab-shell or newer (`cat /home/git/gitlab-shell/VERSION`) and upgrade gitlab-shell immediately if necessary.  ### Releases Gitlab-shell is available from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-shell and https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlab-shell . To upgrade gitlab-shell it suffices to run `sudo su git -c 'git fetch && git checkout in /home/git/gitlab-shell .  ### Workarounds If you are unable to upgrade you can disable the repository import functionality in GitLab by deleting the following code block from `app/contexts/projects/create_context.rb` and restarting GitLab:  <pre> # Import project from cloneable resource if @project.valid? && @project.import_url.present?   shell = Gitlab::Shell.new   if shell.import_repository(@project.path_with_namespace, @project.import_url)     # We should create satellite for imported repo     @project.satellite.create unless @project.satellite.exists?     @project.imported = true     true   else     @project.errors.add(:import_url, 'cannot clone repo')   end end </pre>  ### Credits Thanks to Remy van Elst https://raymii.org/ for reporting the vulnerability to us.  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Comment: GPGTools - https://gpgtools.org  =Qj+H -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Best regards,  Jacob Vosmaer GitLab.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
