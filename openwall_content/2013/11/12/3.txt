If FAMMonitorDirectory fails, lighttpd reads a value from already free()d memory.    Both issues were found with clang static analyzer, so I assume the bad guys already know these.  regards, Stefan  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
