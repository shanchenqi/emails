So, while this vulnerability does not directly affect versions <= downgrading to <= is not a fix.  ## Impact  Because of the way that omniauth-facebook supports setting a per-request state parameter by storing it in the session, it is possible to circumvent the automatic CSRF protection. Therefore the CSRF added in should be considered broken.  If you are currently providing a custom state, you will need to store and retrieve this yourself (for example, by using the session store) to use  All users running an affected release should upgrade to  ## Releases  The releases is available at the normal locations.   ## Workarounds  None.  ## Credits  Egor Homakov (@homakov)   regardsJosef Šimánek   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
