When an attribute list is given in the search request, and if there are several attributes whose names contain the '@' character, and Red Hat Directory Server would crash. An attacker able to contact the server would be able to submit this type of search request with no authentication required.    (Obviously no CVE is required, posting here as this was previously sent to the distros@ mailing list)  --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
