The question I suppose is, like DES (and > 3DES/MD5) at what point do we start assigning CVE's for some of this? > thoughts and comments welcome.  Using a weak encyption algorithm alone isn't a sufficient condition to issue a CVE against software, since often the context of the usage matters a lot.  If you use MD5 or SHA-1 for password hashing (with lots of salt and rounds), then there's no vulnerability.  If you use them for HMACs, then there's also likely no problem.  But if you use them for a signature with a public key, there is.  So to answer the "at what point" question: *right now*, but *only* in the proper context.  There needs to be a demonstrable attack in that context.   tim  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
