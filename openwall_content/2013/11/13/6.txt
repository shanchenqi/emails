Perhaps some sort of chart should be published that allows people to make better decisions?  Oh sure, I totally agree with you.  But sysadmins and programmers don't make the decisions on when to assign a CVE.  My recommendation here applies to security people trying to decide whether or not to call the baby ugly.  Once the CVE is published (with a description of actual risk) , sysadmins can just apply the patch.  tim  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
