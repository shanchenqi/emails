I completely understand and agree with what you wrote but I wonder if we're making it harder for people to understand how to protect themselves.  After having many similar conversations with people that manage systems I find that it's usually easier to say "MD5 bad, good" and then just walk away.  Perhaps some sort of chart should be published that allows people to make better decisions?  - -- Eric  - -------------------------------------------------- Eric "Sparks" Christensen Red Hat, Inc - Product Security Team  sparks@...hat.com - sparks@...oraproject.org 52DF C64A  E3A3 ABDE B3D1 - -------------------------------------------------- -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =MiSz -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
