ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The privilege check applied to hypercall attempts by a HVM guest only refused access from ring 3; rings 1 and 2 were allowed through.  IMPACT ======  Code running in the intermediate privilege rings of HVM guest OSes may be able to elevate its privileges inside the guest by careful hypercall use.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen and later are vulnerable. Xen and earlier are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only PV guests, or running HVM guests known to not make use of protection rings 1 and 2 will avoid this issue. As far as we are aware no mainstream OS (Linux, Windows, BSD) make use of these rings.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.  xsa76.patch        xen-unstable, Xen 4.3.x, Xen 4.2.x, Xen 4.1.x  $ xsa76*.patch  xsa76.patch $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =oChf -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment "xsa76.patch" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
