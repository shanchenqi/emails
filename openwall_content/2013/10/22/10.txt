This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier  Versions Affected:  0.4.x, Not affected:       0.3.x Fixed Versions:      Impact ------  Due to the method of variable interpolation in Cocaine to an attacker may be able to inject hostile commands into a command line via a crafted hash object which are not properly escaped.  The impact is lessened on Ruby version 1.8.* because hashed are not ordered by default, and so an attacker must rely on luck for the attack to work.  An attack of this sort cannot take place if there is only one value being interpolated into the command line.  Users of the Paperclip gem are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version of Cocaine. Users of the 2.7 branch of Paperclip will not need to upgrade as the version of Cocaine it uses is not vulnerable to this attack.  Releases -------- Version fixes the problem involved and is available at rubygems.org  Credits -------  Thanks to Holger Just for reporting this!   -- Jon Yurek http://thoughtbot.com Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
