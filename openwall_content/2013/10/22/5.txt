Account_sponsor_page.php.php did not correctly sanitize project names,  enabling a malicious user to execute malicious JavaScript when visiting  that page.  The criticality of this issue is compounded by the fact that a  high-privilege account (typically project manager or administrator) is  required to edit project names.  Patches attached to [1]. Can you please assign a CVE ID to this issue ?  Thank you  D.
