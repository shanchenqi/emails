The problem wasn't normal bias - it was that it was enforcing "password rules" requiring at-least one uppercase and number, but not lowercase (which was a normal bug).  So the "fix" would technically make the keyspace smaller.  I added the -R / --no-rules flag to my branch which removes enforcement altogether, the full diff from can be viewed here: https://github.com/therealmik/pwgen/compare/securityfixes  Before using this flag, you should consider the minor negative effects on the keyspace vs. generating passwords which might be "accidentally" cracked while looking for simpler passwords.  Either way, generating a longer password has a far better effect on security.  It is not my intent to maintain this package long-term.  If anyone is interested, please fork and push NMUs to Debian.
