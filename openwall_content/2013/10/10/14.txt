ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The qdisk PV disk backend in the qemu-xen flavour of qemu ("upstream qemu") can be influenced by a malicious frontend to leak mapped grant references.  IMPACT ======  A malicious HVM guest can cause the backend domain to run out of grant references, leading to a DoS for any other domain which shares that driver domain.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Any system which is using the qemu-xen qdisk backend for HVM guests is vulnerable.  qemu-xen and qdisk are exposed by systems using libxl from Xen onwards. In Xen qemu-xen was a non-default option, from Xen onwards qemu-xen is the default.  Xen exposes qdisk via libxl but does not support qemu-xen and therefore is not vulnerable.  The xend toolstack has never supported qdisk as a disk backend and therefore such systems are not vulnerable.  Upstream qemu is vulnerable from version 1.1 onwards.  MITIGATION ==========  This vulnerability can be avoided by using a different block backend (e.g. blkback or blktap2) or by using the qemu-xen-traditional version of qemu.  Users of the xl toolstack, see docs/misc/xl-disk-configuration.txt for information on forcing the use of a particular disk backend and xl.cfg(5) for information on forcing the use of qemu-xen-traditional.  Systems which only run PV guests and/or run HVM guests without PV drivers are not vulnerable.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Coverity Scan and Matthew Daley.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.  xsa71-qemu-xen-unstable.patch        xen-unstable, Xen 4.3.x             Xen 4.2.x   $ xsa71*.patch   xsa71-qemu-xen-unstable.patch $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =hcxy -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment "xsa71-qemu-xen-unstable.patch" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
