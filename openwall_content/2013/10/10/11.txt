ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The libxlu library function xlu_vif_parse_rate does not properly handle inputs which consist solely of the '@' character, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.  IMPACT ======  A toolstack which allows untrusted users to specify an arbitrary configuration for the VIF rate can be subjected to a DOS.  The only known user of this library is the xl toolstack which does not have a central long running daemon and therefore the impact is limited to crashing the process which is creating the domain, which exists only to service a single domain.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  The vulnerable code is present from Xen 4.2 onwards.  MITIGATION ==========  Disallowing untrusted users from specifying arbitrary VIF rate limits will avoid this issue.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Coverity Scan and Matthew Daley.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached patch resolves this issue in all branches  xsa68.patch        xen-unstable, Xen 4.3.x, Xen 4.2.x  $ xsa68*.patch  xsa68.patch $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =9/V5 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment "xsa68.patch" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
