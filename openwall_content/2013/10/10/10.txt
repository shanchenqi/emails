ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The emulation of the outs instruction for 64-bit PV guests uses an uninitialized variable as the segment base for the source data if an FS: or GS: segment override is used, and if the segment descriptor the respective non-null selector in the corresponding selector register points to cannot be read by the emulation code (this is possible if the segment register was loaded before a more recent GDT or LDT update, i.e. the segment register contains stale data).  A malicious guest might be able to get hold of contents of the hypervisor stack, through the fault address passed to the page fault handler if the outs raises such a fault (which is mostly under guest control).  Other methods for indirectly deducing information also exist.  IMPACT ======  A malicious 64-bit PV guest might conceivably gain access to sensitive data relating to other guests.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen 3.1.x and later are vulnerable.  Only 64-bit PV guests can take advantage of this vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only HVM or 32-bit PV guests will avoid this issue.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Coverity Scan and Matthew Daley.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.  xsa67.patch             Xen 4.2.x, Xen 4.3.x, xen-unstable  $ xsa67*.patch  xsa67.patch $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =thOF -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment "xsa67.patch" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
