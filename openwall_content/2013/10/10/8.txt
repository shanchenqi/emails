If these:  /* macros for reading/writing tarchive blocks */ #define tar_block_read(t, buf) \     (*((t)->type->readfunc))((t)->fd, (char *)(buf), T_BLOCKSIZE) #define tar_block_write(t, buf) \     (*((t)->type->writefunc))((t)->fd, (char *)(buf), T_BLOCKSIZE)  boil down to functions that implement the same interface as read(2) and write(2), and it sure seems like it, then the |int i| in this:   int  th_read(TAR *t)  { -       int i, j; -       size_t sz; +       int i; +       size_t sz, j, blocks;         char *ptr;  â and the callees, and their declared interfaces â should use ssize_t, not int.
