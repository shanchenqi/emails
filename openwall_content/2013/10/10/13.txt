ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The ocaml binding for the xc_vcpu_getaffinity function incorrectly frees a pointer before using it and subsequently freeing it again afterwards. The code therefore contains a use-after-free and double-free flaws.  IMPACT ======  An attacker may be able to cause a multithreaded toolstack written in ocaml and using this function to race against itself leading to heap corruption and a potential DoS.  Depending on the malloc implementation code execution cannot be ruled out.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  The flaw is present in Xen 4.2 onwards.  Systems using an ocaml based toolstack (e.g. xapi) are vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  Not calling the vcpu_getaffinity function will avoid this issue.  Not allowing untrusted users access to toolstack functionality will avoid this issue.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Coverity Scan and Matthew Daley.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.  xsa69.patch             Xen 4.3.x, Xen 4.2.x, xen-unstable   $ xsa69*.patch  xsa69.patch $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =4eSf -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment "xsa69.patch" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
