ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  If realloc(3) fails then libxl_list_cpupool will incorrectly return the now-free original pointer.  IMPACT ======  An attacker may be able to cause a multithreaded toolstack using this function to race against itself leading to heap corruption and a potential DoS.  Depending on the malloc implementation code execution cannot be ruled out.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  The flaw is present in Xen 4.2 onwards.  Systems using the libxl toolstack library are vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  Not calling the libxl_list_cpupool function will avoid this issue.  Not allowing untrusted users access to toolstack functionality will avoid this issue.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Coverity Scan and Matthew Daley.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.  xsa70.patch             Xen 4.3.x, Xen 4.2.x, xen-unstable   $ xsa70*.patch  xsa70.patch $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =5x/x -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment "xsa70.patch" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
