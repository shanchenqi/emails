The duplicate issue is still embargoed, the other one is also an embargoed issue. I have made notes in our system to notify oss-security/Mitre when they unembargo (so we'll announce the details then).  In future should we hold CVE reject notifications until we can provide the information as to why? I figured sooner was better (but I can also see holding off until details can be released being a sane choice).  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =yOvB -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
