The release notes for cmsmadesimple mention a security issue: "This release brings a few minor features, some performance improvements, documentation improvements, a Smarty upgrade, and a number of bug fixes (including a minor security issue)."  Now, this is all the information you get. Nothing about the kind of security issue, let alone a bug nr or commit. The question is: What do we do with such shitty upstream behaviour?  Last time I reported something alike I was told that I should provide more info. The question is: How?  Sure, I could diff the release to the release before or try to find some repository and read all the commits in the timeframe. But I'm not getting paid for this, I merely want to improve overall security of free software voluntarily.  So how will we proceed with such stuff? In the past, we often had "CVE for unknown security issue in xxx"-alike assignments.  cu, --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
