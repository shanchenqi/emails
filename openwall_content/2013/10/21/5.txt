This risk grows as MITRE's output increases.  On the MITRE side, we are revisiting our procedures for reducing the number of duplicates.  We already privately identified the increased duplicate risk with Kurt and will work with him to make things more manageable.  For this specific situation: MITRE processed the Drupal advisories on September 25, creating new CVEs that were thus available in NVD at approximately 11 AM Eastern time.  Forest's request to oss-security happened on September 26.  Kurt's response to oss-security was on September 27.  So in this case, there were multiple opportunities for requesters to check for pre-existing CVEs in NVD.  The MITRE-assigned and are in more active use and were published first, so they will be kept.  REJECT as a duplicate of  REJECT as a duplicate of  Forest, please update the advisory to use the MITRE-assigned numbers.  - Steve   >-----Original Message----- >From: Henri Salo [mailto:henri@...v.fi] >Sent: Monday, October 21, AM >To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com >Cc: Forest Monsen; Kurt Seifried >Subject: [oss-security] Re: CVE duplicates > >On Fri, Oct 18, at Forest Monsen wrote: >> On Sat, Oct 5, at AM, Henri Salo <henri@...v.fi> wrote: >> >> > Advisory says: >> > >> > (XSS) >> > (CSRF) >> > >> > Are these duplicate CVEs with CVEs below or is there something I am >> > missing? >> > >> >> Henri, it certainly looks like these are duplicates.
