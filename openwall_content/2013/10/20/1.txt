Please use for this issue.  As for shipping a security update with "no details" in order to protect people this doesn't work very well when you're open source and leave the keyword in the source code where the fix is and add comments that give all the details.  You might as well release details in the advisory so that the god guys can quickly assess the issue and deal with it properly, rather then pretending that the bad guys can't read the source code and figure out how to exploit this. It took me literally all of five minutes to download the current version, the previous version minus one, diff them, and look for the keyword "piplined" (what can I say, I was eating a sandwich and only had one hand free ;).  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  iQIcBAEBAgAGBQJSY1tQAAoJEBYNRVNeJnmTenIP/R9TRmTAtPqqqLHLXZhoxuXb =cVts -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
