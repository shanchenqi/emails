This has been reported to VLC and was apparently fixed unintentionally in with the entry "Improve handling of corrupt ASF files". Version is not affected.  The file contains a crafted ASF packet that causes VLC to crash on a read operation, with control of EDI and EAX. In the file attached you will find at starting offset the hex values 17 DE B4 71 in little endian, which attempts to use for a read operation. Control of other variables in the Demux function in asf.c is also possible by changing packet values before and after the offset as per the ASF specification.  The file is located here: https://github.com/pedrib/PoC/blob/master/vlc-crash.asf  I have not been able to obtain any program control so far, so at the moment this only crashes VLC. However someone more skilled might be able to control it.  Can you please provide a CVE for this?
