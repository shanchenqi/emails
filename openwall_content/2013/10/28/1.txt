You would lump them together?  It's still unclear to me what exactly covers.  Patch for the entity expansion DoS:  Patch for not expanding external entities by default:  Are both patches covered? The second one is quite important as it kills the classic XXE vector <!ENTITY foo SYSTEM "/etc/passwd">  For Ubuntu, covers the XXE attack.  For Debian, it's "large memory consumption" only:  For RedHat, it covers both but "libxml2 already provides mechanisms to disable external entities which applications can use. Closing this flaw as 'wontfix'":  And the official page for the CVE isn't helpful:  Regards, Nicolas GrĂŠgoire     Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
