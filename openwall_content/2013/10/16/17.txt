This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier  Versions Affected:  3.x.x Not affected:       4.0.x, 2.3.x Fixed Versions:      Impact  ------  A carefully crafted email address in conjunction with the Action Mailer logger format string could take advantage of a bug in Ruby's sprintf implementation and possibly lead to a denial of service attack.  Impacted Ruby code will look something like this:    "some string #{user_input}" % some_number  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the work arounds immediately.   Releases  --------  The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.   Workarounds  -----------  If you can't upgrade or apply patch to your system, you can work around the issue by using the following monkey patch after requiring Action Mailer:  ```ruby module ActionMailer   class LogSubscriber < ActiveSupport::LogSubscriber     def deliver(event)       recipients = Array.wrap(event.payload[:to]).join(', ')       info("\nSent mail to #{recipients} (#{event.duration.round(1)}ms)")       debug(event.payload[:mail])     end   end end ```  Patches  -------  To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series.  They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.   * 3-2-log-subscriber.patch - Patch for 3.2 series  * 3-1-log-subscriber.patch - Patch for 3.1 series  * 3-0-log-subscriber.patch - Patch for 3.0 series   Please note that only the 4.0.x, 3.2.x, and 2.3.x series are supported at present.  Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.
