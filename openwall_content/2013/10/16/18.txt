Could a CVE be assigned to it?  It was discovered that OpenLDAP, with the rwm overlay to slapd, could segfault if a user were able to query the directory and immediately unbind from the server.  This seems to be due to the rwm overlay not doing reference counting properly, so rwm_conn_destroy frees the session context while rwm_op_search is using it.  This condition also seems to require multiple cores/CPUs to trigger.   References:   This is currently not fixed upstream.  --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
