Wiedemann (SUSE) & Pรกdraig Brady (Red Hat) Products: Nova Affects: All versions  Description: Bernhard M. Wiedemann from SUSE reported a vulnerability in Nova's control of the size of disk images. By using malicious compressed qcow2 disk images, an authenticated user may consume large amounts of disk space for each image, potentially resulting in a Denial of Service attack on Nova compute nodes While fixing this issue, Pรกdraig Brady from Red Hat additionally discovered that OSSA did not fully address in the non-default case where use_cow_images=False, and malicious qcow images are being transferred from Glance. In that specific case, an authenticated user could still consume large amounts of disk space for each instance using the malicious image, potentially also resulting in a Denial of Service attack on Nova compute nodes The provided fixes address both issues.
