Ok. So. Based on this reply:   ================= It was rather a conscious decision. Since libgadu is a reverse-engineered implementation of a proprietary protocol, we have no control over the certificates used for SSL connections. We don't know which certificates will be accepted or rejected by the original client, so there is no reliable way to verify their validity in libgadu. But since you mentioned it, I guess we should at least add a note to the documentation. =================  So basically that's good enough for me.
