This was the one where I was wondering how many people us it. Debian doesn't ship it, nor does Red Hat, Fedora. When I searched it in Google it tries to correct me to "xtrlock", and for the term I get results, so I'm thinking this falls into the "not enough people use it to make a CVE worthwhile" category, is that correct, or is there a large user pool/other factors  I'm unaware of?  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =LBVC -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
