The camera post processing engine (CPP) and video processing engine (VPE) provide an ioctl system call interface to user space clients for communication. When processing arguments passed to the VIDIOC_MSM_CPP_DEQUEUE_STREAM_BUFF_INFO or VIDIOC_MSM_VPE_DEQUEUE_STREAM_BUFF_INFO ioctl subdev handlers, a user space supplied length value is used to copy memory to a local stack buffer without proper bounds checking. An application with access to the respective device nodes can use this flaw to, e.g., elevate privileges.  Access Vector: local Security Risk: high Vulnerability: (stack-based buffer overflow)  The Gemini JPEG encoder and the Jpeg1.0 common encoder/decoder engines of the camera driver are not properly initializing all members of a structure before copying it to user space. This allows a local attacker to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via ioctl system calls.  Access Vector: local Security Risk: low Vulnerability: (information exposure)  Affected versions All Android releases from CAF using a Linux kernel from the following heads:  msm-3.4 jb_3*  Patch  We advise customers to apply the following patches:      Acknowledgement  Qualcomm Innovation Center, Inc.
