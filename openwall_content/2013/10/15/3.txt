A complete crash of a typical web browser is currently always eligible for a CVE assignment from MITRE. This, of course, doesn't mean that a Red Hat Security Advisory would necessarily be published for that issue alone. It also doesn't mean that browser vendors actively request CVE assignments for all such issues.  An example where a CVE assignment isn't made is a clean crash (no memory corruption) of a single process associated with browsing a single web site, i.e., a "tab crash" in some browsers. This might be caused by a malicious web site that triggers a divide by zero. In that situation, it's generally not possible for the crash to disrupt the end user's ongoing work.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =M7qf -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
