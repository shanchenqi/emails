ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  qemu contains a possible buffer overflow in the SCSI code that implements the REPORT LUNS command.  The buffer can be overflowed by creating a SCSI controller with more than attached devices (such as disks) and sending a REPORT LUNS command with a short transfer buffer (less than bytes).  Xen systems do not use the qemu SCSI code by default.  IMPACT ======  On Xen systems where the device_model_args (or equivalent) parameters have been used to configure a SCSI controller for a guest, with more than devices, a malicious guest might be able to escalate its privilege to that of the qemu process in the host (typically root).  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Only Xen systems whose administrators have deliberately configured HVM guests to have emulated SCSI controllers, and where those guests are provided with more than devices, are vulnerable.  We are not aware of any such systems.  MITIGATION AND RESOLUTION =========================  Please refer to the advisories and information from the Qemu project.  If, during the embargo period, you have any questions about this advisory in the context of Xen, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.
