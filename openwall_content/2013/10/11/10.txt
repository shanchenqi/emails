Well, my point is exactly that items (2) or (3) don't (and can't) make  any sense in the context of web apps (or rather, in _any_ context of  potentially untrusted non-native apps), even if a sane (non-flat) volume  model is implemented in PulseAudio. Please don't try to do the impossible.  My current viewpoint is that the root of the problem is not in flat  volumes (they are just an aggravating factor), but in the fact that  untrusted javascript volume is directly connected to a pavucontrol  slider, potentially making that slider disobey the user.  And this is not about sanitizing the volume management in non-malicious  web pages. As I already said, this is about deliberately-malicious  scripts whose (no matter absolute or relative) volume and mute status  cannot be overridden. Think of them as a sound equivalent of a  popups" problem.  P.S. I am not currently registered for GStreamer conference - should I  do so in order to discuss the issue in person with you or with other  GStreamer developers, or is my current LinuxCon registration sufficient?  --  Alexander E.
