While I didn't fully check, this would permit a compromised server to request data from another server, thus leading to potential informations leak ( like passwword, etc ).  Can a CVE be assigned, and I will pass it to upstream on the bug report ?  --  Michael Scherer   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
