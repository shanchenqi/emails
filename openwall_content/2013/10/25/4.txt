It could occur when sending large  messages, wherein all messages are not greater than maximum transfer unit(MTU)  of the underlying medium.  An unprivileged user/program could use this flaw to crash the kernel resulting  in DoS, or potentially execute arbitrary code to escalate privileges to gain  root access to a system.
