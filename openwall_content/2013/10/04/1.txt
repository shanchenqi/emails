I'm not sure this is CVE worthy. In general crash bugs in services are CVE worthy, but crashes in client software are usually limited to things like email clients or web browsers where there is a high potential for processing untrusted data without much user interaction (e.g. displaying some random email or web page) whre you also have the potential to lose work (so there is an impact).  In the case of VLC you load a nasty file, it crashes, you don't do it again. There's not really any impact. You don't lose any work.  Now the question becomes "possible code execution" is how possible? This is based on the fact that memory corruption occurs, or is there more evidence?  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =qnq6 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
