That's a problem, but also an inherent limitation of how such session handling works. The advantages are a stateless backend, no need for state DB, if you have many backends, especially distributed, logins just work no matter which server you connect to.  In both Drupal and Ruby on Rails case the security issues are documented:  https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/http/sessions/#using-cookie-based-sessions  http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#session  the documentation can maybe be improved (especially mentioning HTTPS/HSTS to prevent sniffing of the cookie) but generally speaking this is covered, so no CVEs here.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  iQIcBAEBAgAGBQJSTkbBAAoJEBYNRVNeJnmTnI8QAJyoi0yWRmTzVHUiwMx/mcSa =rjhT -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
