I am very much surprised that Flask is not mentioned at all in your  e-mail. Its default session handler uses only signed cookies, and they  can't even change the default because they don't have the DB layer or  any other persistent storage out of the box.  Flask site is down at the moment, so no link to the documentation. But  the problem is known, see this link for example:   --  Alexander E. Patrakov  --  Alexander E.
