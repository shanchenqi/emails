[while phpmyadmin requires a valid userid and password for mysql db these credentials are pulled from wp-config.php (wordpress config fle) file directly in this plugin]  Besides these two, there are a large number of full path disclosure on the whole project also however as wordpress itself doesn't consider that as a security issue rather mark it as a configuration issue ( http://codex.wordpress.org/Security_FAQ#Why_are_there_path_disclosures_when_directly_loading_certain_files.3F) Hence those are not reported.
