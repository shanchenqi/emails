I agree with Greg. We (Red Hat) haven't requested CVEs for issues in -rc releases, which we consider under development, in the past and we do not intend to start doing that. It's in fact one of the criteria when examining upstream commits - if the bug and the fix is in -rc release, skip it.  Just my 2 cents.  --  Petr Matousek / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
