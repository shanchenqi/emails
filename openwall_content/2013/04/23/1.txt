I want to inform you about multiple vulnerabilities in multiple plugins for WordPress with jPlayer. These are Cross-Site Scripting and Content Spoofing and vulnerabilities.  I've wrote about vulnerabilities in jPlayer earlier jPlayer is used in multiple web applications and particularly in multiple plugins for WordPress. Google dork for jPlayer shows results and for WP plugins with it shows (inurl:Jplayer.swf inurl:/wp-content/plugins/).  Among them are MP3-jPlayer, Haiku minimalist audio player, Background Music, Jammer and WP jPlayer. These five plugins placed in WordPress plugins catalog with tag "jplayer", But there are other vulnerable plugins for WP with Jplayer.swf (which can be found with above-mentioned Google dork). All developers of these plugins, the same as developers of all other web applications with jPlayer, need to update it in their software.  ------------------------- Affected products: -------------------------  MP3-jPlayer and previous versions. Haiku minimalist audio player and previous versions. Background Music 1.0 and previous versions. Jammer 0.2 and previous versions. WP jPlayer 0.1 and previous versions.  Vulnerabilities are in jPlayer versions before Version and the last released version are not vulnerable to mentioned XSS, except CS via JS and XSS via JS callbacks. Also there are other bypass methods which work in version but the developers haven't fixed them besides attack via alert. About that I've wrote to developers already in March and reminded again. So wait for new version with fixing of these vulnerabilities.  ------------------------- Affected vendors: -------------------------  Plugins' pages at WordPress plugins catalog:  MP3-jPlayer http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/mp3-jplayer/ Haiku minimalist audio player http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/haiku-minimalist-audio-player/ Background Music http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/background-music/ Jammer http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jammer/ WP jPlayer http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-jplayer/  ---------- Details: ----------  Cross-Site Scripting (WASC-08):  In different versions of jPlayer there are different XSS vulnerabilities (see in the first advisory) and different WP plugins has different versions of jPlayer.  MP3-jPlayer:   Haiku minimalist audio player:   Background Music:   Jammer:   WP jPlayer:  http:/site/wp-content/plugins/wp-jplayer/assets/js/Jplayer.swf?jQuery=)}catch(e){}if(!self.a)self.a=!alert(document.cookie)//  http:/site/wp-content/plugins/wp-jplayer/assets/js/Jplayer.swf?id='))}catch(e){}if(!self.a)self.a=!alert(document.cookie)//  Content Spoofing (WASC-12):  It's possible to conduct CS (inclusion of audio/video files from external resources) via JS and XSS via JS callbacks. This requires HTML Injection vulnerability at the site. The attack is similar to XSS attacks via callbacks in JW Player  Because this attack vector requires separate vulnerability at target site to conduct CS and XSS attacks with using of jPlayer, the developers didn't do anything to fix it. The same as developers JW Player. So protection from this attack scenario lies solely on web sites owners.  ------------ Timeline: ------------   - informed developers of jPlayer. - developers released jPlayer and informed me. - informed developers of MP3-jPlayer, Haiku minimalist audio player and WP jPlayer (from five developers only these three had contact information).
