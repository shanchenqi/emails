I set this up as a bare minimum type thing:  https://cveform-kseifried.rhcloud.com/cve-request-form/  Not all fields are required. If anyone else has comments/etc please email me and I'll see about getting this written up as a short HOWTO.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =GQFz -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
