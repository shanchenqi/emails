Just for the record, most OpenPGP key certification listings don't indicate anything at all about trust, including "who trusted them". they show cryptographically-verifiable assertions of identity and control over key material.  Put another way, a signature on an OpenPGP key+userid says "I believe that this key belongs to this person" -- it doesn't say anything about trust in that person (or about their intrinsic trustworthiness).  Sorry for the nit-pick, but the term "trust" is so overused and confused in these contexts that i think it's important to clarify it when it's getting muddled.
