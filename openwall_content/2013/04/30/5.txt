It supports a variety of popular platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.) and is developed by skilled volunteers from around the world.  Source code for the entire project is available and licensed under the GNU General Public License.  Bug:  Flightgear allows remote control through Property tree.  It is vulnerable to remote format string vulnerability when some special parameters related with clouds are changed.  This could allow to crash the application or potentially execute arbitrary code under certain conditions.  Fix:  No fix.
