I wasn't aware of StartCom.  I've been using CACert, which is not included in browsers.  My point was that browsers go to great lengths to prevent users from visiting sites that use self-signed certificates, or certificates signed by a CA which the browser does not know / trust, but will happily let users submit forms on unencrypted sites without even a warning.  This is the same "no security is better than imperfect security" logic.
