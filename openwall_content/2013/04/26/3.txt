You actually know very little about the key before and after the signing took place; so you have no way of ascertaining whether the key has been used to sign other things fraudulently. Where a role account is used to sign packages, this is more worrying.  But, yes, I'm being alarmist here again. I do agree that signing things is way better than not; but I am also well aware that just because something is signed does not mean that it should be treated as being without need of security.   > > Q5. what was signed? > >  > > A5.  if it comes out as a text document, according to RFC it has > > some weird properties; hopefully all tar files will be binary.  > > Whatever, what was signed was something with the same digest as the > > tarball.

Absolutely, they share the same building blocks - see the Karlsruhe proceedings for how to interchange ssh and pgp keys for signing and verification.  And the only difference between SSL and PGP is the assurance model - whether a trusted third party should be used (FSVO "trusted"), or whether that should be crowdsourced to the web of trust model.
