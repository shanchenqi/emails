The only reason you would care if the software is signed is if you intend to use it in some way (or you're the of crazy security researchers, which is basically no-one).  > As to unsigned code being wide open, we have previous versions to  > compare against (and, in the sense that we're discussing it here, > the  This assumes they have not been compromised already and the compromised bits brought forwards.

Again if people audited source code changes for security flaws, by definition no new security flaws would be introduced (well they would be, but people would catch them). Seriously, think about it.  > That wasn't my intention, so I'm sorry if it came across that way. > But can we also get away from the "we have signed distfiles now, so > everything is guaranteed to be safe for evermore"? Thanks.  Most of us never said that (and I apologize if we didn't make it clear). We said "more secure", not "completely secure so stop worrying". If we didn't spell it out, we should have, but I think it's obvious from my post, Josh's post, etc that that is the intent.  Right now we have code written by who knows what/who running on millions of servers with no oversight/audits/checks. Witness this weeks WP-Super-Cache debacle, or the timthumb.php thing. If peple actually audited the code changes they would have gone "wow... mfunc... wait.. can't this result in code exec..?".  Oh and I've had NO response from the WP-Super-Cache guy so far. good thing he cares about security. And all the people that use his software.  > Regards, Alistair   - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =9qZN -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
