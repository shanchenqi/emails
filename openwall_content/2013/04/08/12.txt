I'm confused why you are using the word "always" and "Unless `access_ok()' in `__get_user' returns 0".  I don't understand what you are saying.  Anyway, the bottom line is that the x86 version of get_user() doesn't have an info leak and the asm-generic version does.  regards, dan carpenter   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
