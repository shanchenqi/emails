If an unsuspecting autojump user was tricked into running autojump script from the directory a local attacker has write access to, this flaw could be used for arbitrary (Python) code execution with the privileges of the user running the autojump binary / script.  Relevant (final) upstream patches are as follows: [1] [2]  References: [3]  Credit: This issue was found and reported to Red Hat Bugzilla [3] by Zbigniew JÄdrzejewski-Szmek.         Thanks also goes to Jan Pokorny for bringing this one to my attention,         and to William Ting of autojump upstream for promptly fixing the issue.  Could you allocate a CVE identifier for this?
