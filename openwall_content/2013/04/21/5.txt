This bug is present in all versions of CHICKEN.  It will be fixed in and as per commit Version will likely be the first stable release to include this fix, unless it is decided to backport this fix to the stability release.  The full announcement is here:  By the way, I'm confused as to why the CVEs I've requested so far don't show up in NVD.  For example, says the CVE does not exist, but Kurt assigned it in February:  The other CVE numbers in that mail produce a "not found" page as well and an NVD database search for "chicken" turns up nothing related to Chicken Scheme.  The page says the database was last updated April 19th so that's not the cause either.
