I think it wouldn't have been unreasonable for the oss-security community to expect you "to form a more official security response" before joining linux-distros, so now you're sort of in debt. ;-)  Specifically, there doesn't appear to be an announcement channel for Arch Linux security updates, nor even an issue tracker or change log with security issues and fixes clearly marked as such.  You've listed a bug tracker URL at:  http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/vendors#arch-linux  which is:  https://bugs.archlinux.org  Going to that URL, I see a list of all sorts of bugs.  Searching it for "security", I find only 2 bugs.  Perhaps there were many more security issues that you've actually dealt with, and you need to start documenting them as such for your users.
