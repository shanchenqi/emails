I want to inform you about multiple vulnerabilities in jPlayer. These are  Cross-Site Scripting and Content Spoofing and vulnerabilities in jPlayer.  Which is used at tens thousands of web sites and in multiple web  applications.  ------------------------- Affected products: -------------------------  Vulnerable are versions before jPlayer Version and the last  released version are not vulnerable to mentioned XSS, except CS via JS  and XSS via JS callbacks. Also there are other bypass methods which work in  version but the developers haven't fixed them besides attack via  alert. About that I've wrote to developers already in March and reminded  again. So wait for new version with fixing of these vulnerabilities.  ------------------------- Affected vendors: -------------------------  Happyworm http://www.jplayer.org  ---------- Details: ----------  Cross-Site Scripting (WASC-08):  In different versions of jPlayer there are different XSS vulnerabilities.  -  http:/site/Jplayer.swf?id=%22))}catch(e){}if(!self.a)self.a=!alert(document.cookie)//   http:/site/Jplayer.swf?id=%27))}catch(e){}if(!self.a)self.a=!alert(document.cookie)//   http:/site/Jplayer.swf?jQuery=)}catch(e){}if(!self.a)self.a=!alert(document.cookie)//  http:/site/Jplayer.swf?id=%27))}catch(e){}if(!self.a)self.a=!alert(document.cookie)//  In version these XSS vulnerabilities were fixed (the developers was  informed about hole in jQuery parameter and made a fix, which protected from  both attacks). But Malte Batram (in version and I (in version  have found new ones.  - (and previous versions):  Attack works in Firefox (all versions and browsers on Gecko engine), IE6 and  Opera   - (and previous versions):  http:/site/Jplayer.swf?jQuery=alert&id=XSS  Content Spoofing (WASC-12):  It's possible to conduct CS (inclusion of audio/video files from external  resources) via JS and XSS via JS callbacks. This requires HTML Injection  vulnerability at the site. The attack is similar to XSS attacks via  callbacks in JW Player  Because this attack vector requires separate vulnerability at target site to  conduct CS and XSS attacks with using of jPlayer, the developers didn't do  anything to fix it. The same as developers JW Player. So protection from  this attack scenario lies solely on web sites owners.  ------------ Timeline: ------------   - found vulnerabilities in jPlayer at multiple web sites (in  version - announced at my site. - informed developers. - discussed with developers different vulnerabilities in  different versions of jPlayer and at their sites. - developers was informed by Malte Batram's about XSS hole in  - developers fixed Malte's XSS hole in in github  - informed developers about new hole, which works in - sent details of new XSS and warned about possibility for other  XSS attacks and gave recommendations about proper fixing of XSS to prevent  any future XSS. - reminded developers about last hole. - developers fixed my XSS hole in in github. - developers released jPlayer  and informed me. - disclosed at my site about jPlayer  - tested version and found that developers fixed only one  attack vector and didn't make complete fix, as I recommended in March, so I  reminded them and sent them examples of two new XSS.
