Coming from one of the common upstreams (X.Org), it would really be helpful if there was a "Best Practices" page we could reference, since we've gotten a couple complaints that we're not doing enough, but not concrete enough suggestions that we can go modify our release script to implement them.   (Currently we include MD5, SHA1, & checksums in the release announcement e-mails, which we tell maintainers to pgp sign with their own keys when sending - though unfortunately most of the mailing list archives break the ability to verify when they mangle email addresses to prevent spam harvesting from their archives.)  If there was a common standard, with instructions, we'd be far more likely to spend the time to adopt it, than just a "make signatures appear somewhere, in an unspecified format".  --  	-Alan Coopersmith-              alan.coopersmith@...cle.com 	 Oracle Solaris Engineering - http://blogs.oracle.com/alanc  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
