We have particular description styles and analytical requirements that are not visible to the general public.  We have a process where we actively monitor public sources including oss-security, and we prioritize which CVE entries are published first.  Priorities are currently guided by but other disclosures are certainly considered as well.  We are currently focused on working with the CVE Editorial Board on extending the CVE ID syntax to handle more than vulnerabilities per year, and we are also training several new hires.  We expect our output to rise noticeably within a few months, and we will continue to refine our analysis and publication processes to improve our production in a way that balances the needs of CVE's many diverse users.  - Steve   >-----Original Message----- >From: Peter Bex [mailto:Peter.Bex@...all.nl] >Sent: Monday, April 29, PM >To: Open Source Security >Subject: Re: [oss-security] OS command injection vulnerability in Chicken >Scheme > >On Mon, Apr 29, at Kurt Seifried wrote: >> > The full announcement is here: >> > >> >> Please use for this issue. > >Thank you. > >> > By the way, I'm confused as to why the CVEs I've requested so far >> > don't show up in NVD.
