I think GPG should too. > Thoughts/comments before I assign this?  A similar attack (related to PGP/MIME) has been under discussion on the enigmail list last month.  see the thread starting at:    I think the enigmail issues are distinct from the gpg issues, and i don't think they should be conflated into the same CVE.  In particular, i see the enigmail issues as (security-related) UI/UX problems, but i see the gpg problems as (security-related) API/programmatic-use problems.  By comparison with enigmail, thunderbird's native S/MIME verification routines display no cryptographic indicators at all if only part of a message is signed.  This means that S/MIME-signed messages sent through common mailing list software which attaches a text/plain MIME footer (like mailman) will not indicate that they are verifiable at all.  it's not a pretty set of tradeoffs. :/  	--dkg   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
