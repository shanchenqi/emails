The 2 vulnerabilities had been assigned the CVE identifier and respectively.  # Vendor Homepage: http://www.simplehrm.com/ # Software Link: http://sourceforge.net/projects/simplehrm/ # Version: # Tested on: 2.2 & 2.3 # CVE :   Details: ----------- * *  Simple HRM system is vulnerable to sqli attacks in their login page. Carefully crafted requests can use the scope to inject arbitrary SQLthrough the login form and obtain information such as password hash.  *Attack URL:* http://localhost/simplehrm/index.php/user/setLogin *Method:* POST *Vuln Parameter: *username=*(SQL INJECTION)*&password=abcdef *Vuln Type*: unsanitised input argument *($name)* in  *Vuln **File:* simlehrm/flexycms/modules/user/user_manager.php *Line:* 84     $res_company = getsingleindexrow('CALL get_search_sql("'.TABLE_PREFIX.'company","email_id = \''.$name.'\' AND isactive = 1 LIMIT 1")');   We discovered that if an attacker were to grab hold of the user's password hash, the attacker can easily spoof a cookie and impersonate as anyone to access the system. Together with the blind sql injection stated above, an attacker can simply blind the password hash, userid, username and recreate a cookie.  *Vuln **File:* simlehrm/flexycms/modules/user/user_manager.php *Line:*     $v_user_password = md5($info['id_user'].$info['username'].$info['password']);  This vuln effectively defeats one of the primary purposes of password hashing.  * *  Timeline: -------------  Date Discovered: 07 March Vendor notified: 12 march Advisory posted: 12 April (No response from Vendor, published)   Regards  Team Doraemon.Sk8ers   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
