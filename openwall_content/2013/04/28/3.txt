The major projects have (hopefully) fixed all of these by now, and the clients should only be vulnerable if they're connected to a hostile server.  The commit ids below are all from the boinc-v2 repository, see http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/browser/boinc-v2 for a web view.  These are the ones I consider to be obviously important:  * various stack overflow vulnerabilities in the XML parser   used by both the client and server software. I think that any 7.x version   is vulnerable, but possibly not the branch or earlier. No promises.    (Found/reported by me. I notified all public projects I could find who    were running obviously-vulnerable copies of the code, in early March.)       * Stack overflow in the client code by providing multiple file_signature   elements. and are vulnerable. 7.x isn't.    (This was fixed back in possibly accidentally.)     * SQL injections in the server-side scheduler code:    (Found/reported by me. I warned projects about this at the same time    as the the above notifications, hopefully they've mostly patched it..)
