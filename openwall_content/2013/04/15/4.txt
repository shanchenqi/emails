I'm summarizing them for : the historical record.  These bugs were never exploitable on a : default-configured released kernel, but some 3.8 versions are : vulnerable depending on configuration.  Do you know if these were patched, and therefore possibly disclosed via  the commits? With these details, it is difficult to line them up to  existing reports.
