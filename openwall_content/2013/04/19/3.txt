I've just subscribed Dag-Erling Smorgrav to the distros list, as the new FreeBSD Security Officer.  (Also subscribed are two other members of the FreeBSD security team.)  2. I've just removed Pardus from the linux-distros list, since mail to both contacts for Pardus has been bouncing for a couple of weeks now (I wish they informed us of their resignation(?) themselves).  3. A while ago, I've removed CentOS from the linux-distros list, since the only subscriber for CentOS has resigned from a security role there (and informed me of that - thanks!)  4. There was some unscheduled downtime for the distros and linux-distros lists yesterday and today.  The SMTP response was Service unavailable - try again later".  Checking the logs, I see that only two messages were affected - one by a person who informed me of the issue (and who I think will resend the message now), and the other probably a spam message from a Google Apps user (the message was correctly processed and rejected with Missing the [vs] anti-spam tag, see http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros" once the issue causing the soft-rejects was corrected).  So the downtime did not cause much harm, yet I am sorry for it.
