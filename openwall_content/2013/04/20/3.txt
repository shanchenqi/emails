Normally, I'd ask an existing security contact or a project leader to approve this, but there don't appear to be people with roles like these at Arch Linux - or are there, and who are they?  (Apparently, there was a leader until  https://www.archlinux.org/developers/ lists you as "Toolchain Maintainer, Pacman Developer", which sounds like a sufficiently core role for you to appoint yourself (or someone else) as a security contact for Arch Linux, if/since there's no security contact nor a leader.  Please add Arch Linux information to:  http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/vendors  How do you expect to use the information arriving via linux-distros?
