AFAICT to fix this in Fedora and Fedora EPEL-6 versions, we have just rebased to latest upstream version. But you are truly right (assuming this being the reason you are checking with us), that on Fedora EPEL-5 we are shipping older based version of ModSecurity).  FWIHL:   [1]  it's wasn't immediately clear how the backported upstream patch would look like in / against that version (and not completely sure we can just rebase in that product too - Athmane could you clarify here if we can rebase or would rather want upstream patch form against version?)  Breno, so if you are willing to help (and Athmane would confirm we need patch against version), it would be appreciated if you could provide it.  That's just for our expectations. Obviously other vendors might be interested in upstream patch backports against different versions yet (but I will let them to speak out their needs by themselves).  Thank you for your time / check anyway. It's appreciated.  Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team   ----- Original Message ----- Hello Jan,  Are you guys backporting de patch to old versions of ModSecurity ?
