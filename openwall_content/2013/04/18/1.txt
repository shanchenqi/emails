My thought would be that it should be quit explicit, e.g. "this entire message/file/etc. was signed by X" or "a part of this file/message/etc. was signed by X" and so on.  The next challenge is how to signal it to the end user. One challenge with enigmail is it provides some of the signalling "in band" as it were (in the email text area) which can be modified by the attacker, and some of it "out of band: (at the top of the window area it puts the color bar and text to clarify. With GPG command line it can maybe say something like "part of this message was signed by X"?  I'm inclined to assign a CVE to this type of vulnerability but I have no idea how we fix this _properly_. Anyone have ideas?   - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =1b8Q -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
