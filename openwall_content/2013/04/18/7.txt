ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The SYSENTER instruction can be used by PV guests to accelerate system call processing. This instruction, however, leaves the EFLAGS register mostly unmodified - in particular, the NT flag doesn't get cleared. If the hypervisor subsequently uses IRET to return to the guest (which it will always do if the guest is a 32-bit one), that instruction will cause a #GP fault to be raised, but the recovery code in the hypervisor will again try to use IRET without intermediately clearing the NT flag. The #GP fault raised on this second IRET is a fatal event, causing the hypervisor to crash.  IMPACT ======  Malicious or buggy unprivileged user space can cause the entire host to crash.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All 64-bit Xen versions from 3.1 onwards running on Intel CPUs are vulnerable.  32-bit Xen is not affected, as it doesn't permit the use of SYSENTER by PV guests. 64-bit Xen run on AMD CPUs isn't affected since AMD CPUs don't allow the use of SYSENTER in long mode.  The vulnerability is only exposed by PV guests.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only HVM guests, or running PV guests on only 32-bit hosts or only AMD CPUs will avoid this vulnerability.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.
