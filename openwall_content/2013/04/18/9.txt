IMPACT ======  A malicious guest administrator can cause undefined behaviour; depending on the dom0 kernel a host crash is possible, but information leakage or privilege escalation cannot be ruled out.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen 4.0 and 4.1 are vulnerable.  Any kind of guest can trigger the vulnerability.  Xen 4.2 and xen-unstable, as well as Xen 3.x and earlier, are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  Using only trustworthy guest kernels will avoid the vulnerability.  Using a debug build of Xen will eliminate the possible information leak or privilege violation; instead, if the vulnerability is attacked, Xen will crash.  NOTE REGARDING EMBARGO ======================  A crash resulting from this bug has been reported by a user on the public xen-devel mailing list.  There is therefore no embargo.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.   $ xsa50-*.patch  $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =jiz6 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
