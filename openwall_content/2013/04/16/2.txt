A guest operating system administrator could write a header to particular raw disk image format, describing another format than original one for that disk image, leading to scenario in which after restart of that guest, QEMU would detect new format of the image, and could allow the guest to read any file on the host if QEMU was sufficiently privileged.  This issue was found by Daniel Berrange of Red Hat.
