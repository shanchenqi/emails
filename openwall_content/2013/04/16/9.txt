Looking at this list, is there some way to restrict this new  functionality to, say, membership in a certain group?  At present, most  system users (daemons) do not need this functionality, so it would make  sense to restrict access to it.  Or is the expectation that we disable CONFIG_USER_NS until things  stabilize further?  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
