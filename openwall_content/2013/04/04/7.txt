IMPACT ======  Malicious guest kernels could inject arbitrary events or corrupt other hypervisor state, possibly leading to code execution.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen versions from 3.2 onwards are vulnerable when making use of XSM.  Configurations without XSM or with a dummy module are not affected.  MITIGATION ==========  Running without XSM (which is the default) will avoid this vulnerability, albeit doing so will likely lower overall security of systems that would otherwise have XSM enabled.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.              Xen 4.1.x    Xen 4.2.x and xen-unstable  $ xsa47*.patch   $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =/g6f -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
