While they were originally merged into a single CVE (same vulnerability type), we also have guidelines that SPLIT issues into different groups if they are found by different researchers.  So, the MITRE team SPLIT these CVEs accordingly, after the initial erroneous assignment.  We listed as a reference for the new/split because this was effectively where the vulnerability was more widely disclosed.  - Steve    >-----Original Message----- >From: Henri Salo [mailto:henri@...v.fi] >Sent: Thursday, April 04, AM >To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com >Subject: [oss-security] Confused with Drupal CVEs > >Hello, > > >Why does >link to > >Duplicate? > >--- >Henri Salo  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
