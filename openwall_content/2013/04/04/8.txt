Close button available to users despite workflow restrictions  This issue affects Mantis and later.  It allows low-privileged users to close issues even though the workflow settings do not permit it.  Reference:   2. XSS vulnerability when deleting a version  This issue affects Mantis only.   Arbitrary JavaScript could be executed in the client's browser when deleting a version containing embedded code in its name. The criticality of this issue is compounded by the fact that a high-privilege account (typically project manager or administrator) is required to both to create and delete a version.  Reference:   3. XSS vulnerability on Configuration Report page  This issue affects Mantis only [1].   If the system defines a Project containing embedded JavaScript code in its name, that code would be executed in the client's browser when displaying the configuration report page (adm_config_report.php).  The severity of this issue is mitigated by the need to have a high-privileged account both to set the project's name and to access the configuration report page.  Reference:   4. XSS issue on Configuration Report page when displaying complex value  This issue affects Mantis and later.  Lack of proper string escaping allows users (having admin access) to enter arbitrary javascript code and have it executed on the user's browser.  Reference:   Issues resolution:   - 1 & 2 will be fixed in upcoming release expected to go live     sometime next week (patches are available in the referenced issues)   - 3 & 4 were both resolved in version released on    Could you kindly assign CVEs for the above issues ? Thanks in advance.   Best regards, D. Regad MantisBT Developer http://www.mantisbt.org  [1] MantisBT version was tagged in the repository but never formally released, as we discovered several critical issues at the last minute and decided to pull it and released a week later instead.
