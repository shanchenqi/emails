Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are combined in that array, right?  Then  the protocol limit seems to be around + addresses (NAME (2  bytes with compression) + RCLASS (2) + RTYPE(2) + TTL (4) + RDATALEN(2)  + RDATA(4 or 16) per record, total available space is 64K), which could  be used to blow stacks sometimes used by JVMs.  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
