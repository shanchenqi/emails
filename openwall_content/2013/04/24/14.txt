I want to inform you about multiple vulnerabilities in multiple themes for  WordPress with jPlayer. These are Cross-Site Scripting, Content Spoofing and  Full path disclosure vulnerabilities.  I've wrote about vulnerabilities in jPlayer earlier  jPlayer is used in  multiple web applications and particularly in multiple plugins (as I've  wrote earlier) and themes for WordPress. And in WP themes even more then in  plugins - there are many thousands of vulnerable themes (these are free,  commercial and custom themes). Plus there are many web sites which placed  Jplayer.swf in other folders besides plugins and themes. Google dork for  jPlayer shows results and for WP themes with it shows  (inurl:Jplayer.swf inurl:/wp-content/themes/).  Among them are Studiozen, Photocrati, Music, Imperial Fairytale and  Feather12. And thousands of other themes (see Google dork). All developers  of these themes, the same as developers of all other web applications with  jPlayer, need to update it in their software.  ------------------------- Affected products: -------------------------  All versions of Studiozen, Photocrati, Music, Imperial Fairytale and  Feather12 themes.  Vulnerabilities are in jPlayer versions before Version and  the last released version are not vulnerable to mentioned XSS, except  CS via JS and XSS via JS callbacks. Also there are other bypass methods  which work in version but the developers haven't fixed them besides  attack via alert. About that I've wrote to developers already in March and  reminded again. So wait for new version with fixing of these  vulnerabilities.  ---------- Details: ----------  Cross-Site Scripting (WASC-08):  In different versions of jPlayer there are different XSS vulnerabilities  (see in the first advisory) and different WP themes has different versions  of jPlayer.  Studiozen:   Photocrati:  http://site/wp-content/themes/photocrati-theme/scripts/Jplayer.swf?id=%22))}catch(e){}if(!self.a)self.a=!alert(document.cookie)//  Music:  http://site/wp-content/themes/music/js/Jplayer.swf?id=%22))}catch(e){}if(!self.a)self.a=!alert(document.cookie)//  Imperial Fairytale:   Feather12:  http://site/wp-content/themes/feather12/js/Jplayer.swf?jQuery=)}catch(e){}if(!self.a)self.a=!alert(document.cookie)//   Content Spoofing (WASC-12):  It's possible to conduct CS (inclusion of audio/video files from external  resources) via JS and XSS via JS callbacks. This requires HTML Injection  vulnerability at the site. The attack is similar to XSS attacks via  callbacks in JW Player  Because this attack vector requires separate vulnerability at target site to  conduct CS and XSS attacks with using of jPlayer, the developers didn't do  anything to fix it. The same as developers JW Player. So protection from  this attack scenario lies solely on web sites owners.  Full path disclosure (WASC-13):  All mentioned themes have FPD vulnerabilities in php-files (in index.php and  others), which is typically for WP themes.  http://site/wp-content/themes/studiozen/  http://site/wp-content/themes/photocrati-theme/  http://site/wp-content/themes/music/  http://site/wp-content/themes/imperial-fairytale/  http://site/wp-content/themes/feather12/  ------------ Timeline: ------------   - informed developers of jPlayer. - developers released jPlayer  and informed me. - informed multiple developers of WordPress plugins and other  software with jPlayer.
