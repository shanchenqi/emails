A network intermediary could use this flaw to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks on IRC users.  This flaw has existed, and been flagged in the source code[2], since at least (the year in which telepathy-idle moved from Sourceforge to freedesktop.org). I don't know whether that means it should get an ID of the form  The upcoming version will fix this vulnerability.  Versions to (which use GLib for TLS) carried out some cursory checks on the certificate, but did not check that the issuer was a trusted CA, that the identity matched the server's hostname, or that the certificate had not expired. A minimal patch to correct this is to delete the call to g_socket_client_set_tls_validation_flags() (this will make one regression test fail).  Versions and older (which use OpenSSL for TLS) do not have any support for certificate verification at all.
