Fixed."  and says: "Any mfunc/mclude/dynamic-cached-content tags in comments are now removed."  To me this looks like 1.3 contained an incomplete fix that got completed in (?), but I don't know. If that's the case, we should probably have another CVE for the incomplete fix.  - --  Hanno Bรถck		mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG: -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =DIVv -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
