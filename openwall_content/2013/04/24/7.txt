If a reference is about a data-type injection impact in an application other than a Ruby on Rails application, it should not be mapped to this CVE. However, an applicable reference about interaction between Ruby on Rails and Microsoft SQL Server (or interaction between Ruby on Rails and IBM DB2) should be mapped to this CVE.  (There might be a misinterpretation that is only about interaction with MySQL. possibly suggests that, but we're bringing this up mostly because of a comment that someone else sent directly to MITRE.)  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJReBIGAAoJEGvefgSNfHMdJpsH/1FRwadPMUtWImCMRTqpUY++ =jViV -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
