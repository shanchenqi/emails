Sample is tg3 (around slide 18)  Introduced by: commit Author: Matt Carlson <mcarlson@...adcom.com> Date:   Mon Apr 5      tg3: Use VPD fw version when present  which was added during Linux 3.2 development.  Fixed by:  commit Author: Kees Cook <keescook@...omium.org> Date:   Wed Mar 27      tg3: fix length overflow in VPD firmware parsing          Commit ("tg3: Use VPD fw version     when present") introduced VPD parsing that contained a potential length     overflow.          Limit the hardware's reported firmware string length (max bytes) to     stay inside the driver's firmware string length (32 bytes). On overflow,     truncate the formatted firmware string instead of potentially overwriting     portions of the tg3 struct.
