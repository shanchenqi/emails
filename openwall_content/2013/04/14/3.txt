Unprivileged users can make use of flaws in the buggy protocols to leak up to bytes of kernel stack memory by using recvmsg(2)/recvfrom(2). The root cause for all those info leaks is described in the following merge commit:   As sys_recvfrom() and sys_recvmsg() behaved this way since the introduction of socket address information passing in Linux for recvmsg) the protocols in question are potentially all vulnerable since there introduction. But I haven't investigated this any further for any other protocol but ATM and AF_ALG, which are both indeed vulnerable since there introduction -- for ATM, for AF_ALG.  The fixes are the following:  atm: update msg_namelen in vcc_recvmsg()  ax25: fix info leak via msg_name in ax25_recvmsg()  Bluetooth: fix possible info leak in bt_sock_recvmsg()  Bluetooth: RFCOMM - Fix missing msg_namelen update in rfcomm_sock_recvmsg()  Bluetooth: SCO - Fix missing msg_namelen update in sco_sock_recvmsg()  2d6fbfe caif: Fix missing msg_namelen update in caif_seqpkt_recvmsg()  irda: Fix missing msg_namelen update in irda_recvmsg_dgram()  iucv: Fix missing msg_namelen update in iucv_sock_recvmsg()  l2tp: fix info leak in l2tp_ip6_recvmsg()  llc: Fix missing msg_namelen update in llc_ui_recvmsg()  3ce5efa netrom: fix info leak via msg_name in nr_recvmsg() needs also: netrom: fix invalid use of sizeof in nr_recvmsg()  NFC: llcp: fix info leaks via msg_name in llcp_sock_recvmsg()  rose: fix info leak via msg_name in rose_recvmsg()  tipc: fix info leaks via msg_name in recv_msg/recv_stream  VSOCK: vmci - fix possible info leak in vmci_transport_dgram_dequeue()  VSOCK: Fix missing msg_namelen update in vsock_stream_recvmsg()  Still lurking in crypto-2.6.git is the fix for AF_ALG: crypto: algif - suppress sending source address information in recvmsg  All of the above commits are scheduled for the appropriate stable and longterm kernels.
