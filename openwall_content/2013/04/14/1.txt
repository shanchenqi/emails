Any site using this plugin is pulling "hxxp://i.aaur.net/i.php" and including it in the page they generate and send to a user. This opens up a huge can of worms, anyone that can man in the middle your server can now inject PHP into your blog, ot anything sent to the clients/etc.  Please use for this issue.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  DpvupDzrdKT6n8ffkTqV =wTdQ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
