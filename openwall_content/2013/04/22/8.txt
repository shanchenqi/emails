Have a look at verify_iovec()/verify_compat_iovec(). They're | updating the msg_name and msg_iov pointers.    I did, both seem to use user supplied `msg_namelen' value to copy contents  from user `msg_name' to `sockaddr_storage addr' variable. And when  `msg_namelen' is zero(0) msg_name is set to NULL. Later same `msg_namelen'  bytes are copied to user area, right?  Ah..right, both are called with `mode = VERIFY_WRITE' and both initialise  `addr' variable when mode = VERIFY_READ.  If it's copying user data to `addr', why selectively do it when mode =  VERIFY_READ?  Also, wouldn't - memset(addr, 0, sizeof(addr)) - fix this leak for all  definitions of <proto>_recvmsg() routine??
