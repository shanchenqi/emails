Thanks for the explanation, but, given the rate-of-churn[1] in the Linux kernel -rc releases, I would be really wary to start wanting to assign CVEs to things that only show up in these types of kernel releases.  Unless you really want to be swamped with requests, it's your choice :)  Linux kernel -rc releases are for developers, and for those people wanting to help with Linux kernel development, they are not for anyone to run on any system that they do not to expect to immediately explode into a bunch of pieces, let alone expect to be "perfect" from a security standpoint.  These releases are much different from the two closed-source products you list above, which are not developed in the open, and rely on "public beta" releases to do some of their testing on real-world systems.  As the Linux kernel is developed entirely in the open, starting to want to assign CVE entries to issues that show up in one -rc release, and are fixed before the final kernel release, seems a bit odd.  But hey, it's your system, not mine, good luck.  greg k-h  [1] You do realize just how fast it is, right?  Faster than you can ever     imagine, or even want to think about, and almost impossible to keep     up with.
