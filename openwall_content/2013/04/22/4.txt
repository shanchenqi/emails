This does cause some problems for projects which rely on dynamically generated tarballs though; in the past we've had trouble with github and bitbucket (they seem to be somewhat stable at the moment but I'm not convinced it won't happen again). Has anyone come up with a better way to handle that situation?  I wonder if it might be worth looking at infrastructure to verify PGP signatures as part of the framework too though, this is potentially useful for updates.
