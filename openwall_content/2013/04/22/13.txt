MITRE has never had any restrictions on CVEs for issues that exist only in release-candidate software or only in beta software. See for example "Attendees agreed that CVE should include problems in beta software, provided that the beta code was intended for public dissemination" in the post.  These CVEs tend to be rare, possibly because they are useful to fewer people. Recent examples in which a major vendor specifically chose to assign a CVE name to an issue affecting only beta software are:    - VMware Studio 2.0 public beta    - Symantec Norton Mobile Security 1.0 Beta  A few months ago, MITRE started to draft some rough guidelines for a case of a vendor who was considering use of CVEs during beta testing. That case seems mostly inapplicable to the current question etc. weren't in any sense based on "vendor" requests), but we might be able to share guidelines at some point if any vendor here is in a similar position.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =UeL+ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
