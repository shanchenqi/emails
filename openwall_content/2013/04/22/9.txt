A remote attacker could issue a specially-crafted Sun RPC request that, when processed, would lead to rpcbind daemon crash.  A different vulnerability than  [3]  Particular upstream patch: [4]  Note: While the original issue has been reported to possibly       allow / lead to arbitrary code execution under certain circumstances,       the current is believed to be able to cause (remote)       rpcbind daemon crash "only".
