No. It is capped in move_addr_to_user() to the actual size -- if set by the protocol -- or sizeof(struct sockaddr_storage) -- whichever is smaller.  > Ah..right, both are called with `mode = VERIFY_WRITE' and both initialise > `addr' variable when mode = VERIFY_READ. > > If it's copying user data to `addr', why selectively do it when mode = > VERIFY_READ?  It's called with VERIFY_READ in __sys_sendmsg() because in this case "addr" is an input parameter. For recvmsg() it's an output parameter so doesn't need to be read, but only written to.  > Also, wouldn't - memset(addr, 0, sizeof(addr)) - fix this leak for all > definitions of <proto>_recvmsg() routine??
