What may differ is the way you can access the property tree, and so the vulnerable code:  * The remote way, which is not activated by default, is accessible when "telnet" or "props" options are passed to the program.  * The local way (not too interesting), the user modifies cloud parameters through GUI window.  * And a third way I just realized out. Flightgear uses a script language called Nasal. Nasal allows, among other things, to edit the property tree. These scripts can be used directly from the models , aircrafts, airports, etc - without any security check - (http://wiki.flightgear.org/Howto:Nasal_in_scenery_object_XML_files) so by loading a specially crafted model, the vulnerability can be thrown.  By the way reading a little more about Nasal (http://wiki.flightgear.org/ Howto:Making_HTTP_Requests_from_Nasal) it seems to be that you can do a lot of weird things like make HTTP requests ... WTF!  So I theoretically could create an aircraft which does a lot of creative web requests :\  Yes, one don't usually think that a flight simulator has those advanced features.  Regards.
