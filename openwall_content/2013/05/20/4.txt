There should be no need for two separate CVEs for this issue. Problematic match_hostname was developed in Python 3.  As its functionality is needed by Python 2 users, and it is not provided by the standard library, Python 3 implementation was made available via different module.  It's the same code, packaged in python (3.x) and python-backports-ssl_match_hostname packages.  The same CVE should apply to both.  Given that was assigned to Python 3 ssl, seems like the one to reject as dupe.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
