Timo, in relation with the previous (similar) one (thanks to Tomas Hoger for pointing out):   [1]   [2]  this time the CVE identifier should be allocated / issue is valid, right?  While in the former [1], [2] case just the connection for the user issuing the command would crash, this time (assuming) either whole dovecot daemon might hang or even if the whole daemon wouldn't hang (and request is handled within a thread), that request would made the particular thread to consume excessive amount of CPU due to infinite loop, right?  Timo, can you confirm / disprove a CVE identifier should be assigned to this?  Thank you && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team  >  > The vulnerability is reported in version 2.2. >  >  > Solution > Update to version >  > Provided and/or discovered by > Reported by the vendor. >  > Original Advisory > >  > Commit: > >  > [1]: >  > -- > Agostino Sarubbo > Gentoo Linux Developer >   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
