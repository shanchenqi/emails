Especially if it gives a "baseline", "level 1", "level 2", etc. set of standards. I'm an open source developer working in a small team. We need to improve our processes but sometimes don't have the time to figure out the best way. Guidelines would speed that up for us and give me something I can point at to convince my team mates.
