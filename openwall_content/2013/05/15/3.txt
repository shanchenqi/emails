I do not think anyone realized it was a "security" fix.  It was never mentioned to the security@...nel.org alias, and I only picked it up for the stable releases because someone said, "hey, here's another trinity bugfix that userspace can trigger".  We fix those all the time, every single stable kernel release.  The only thing different this time is someone took the time to develop a simple exploit for others to use.  So I don't think this was any more or less "silent" than the normal kernel bug fixes that happen every single week.  thanks,  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
