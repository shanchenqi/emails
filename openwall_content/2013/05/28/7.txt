Expired tokens for authenticated users could continue to be used, potentially resulting in the bypass of intended security policies. The effect of PKI token revocation is also reversed when the token expires, in the sense that a revoked token is once again treated as being valid. Only setups using PKI tokens are affected.  Note: The affected code was added to Keystone in the Folsom release, but was moved to python-keystoneclient during the Grizzly development cycle.  python-keystoneclient fix (will be included in upcoming release):  Keystone (Folsom) fix:  References:  - --  Thierry Carrez (ttx) OpenStack Vulnerability Management Team -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with undefined - http://www.enigmail.net/  BslUz5cGAucwXTz2vSHs =bu2N -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
