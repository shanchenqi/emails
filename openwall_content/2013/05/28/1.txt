The fallback could possibly be triggered accidentally by MAC schemes, such  as selinux and apparmor.  There's 8 packages in Ubuntu that depend on this, so I guess it would be  worth checking them to see if they execute pwgen in an apparmor context that  doesn't allow /dev/urandom access.  I had a quick look at maas-region- controller, and it seems to just be calling it from a postinst script.  I have a patch attached to the LP bug that removes the fallback (in favour  of bailing out with an message to stderr and exit code 1), and removes the  modulo bias.  The default mode of this program generates extremely low entropy passwords -  It is probably worth changing the default to "secure" mode and removing  phonemes mode, to avoid putting users at risk.
