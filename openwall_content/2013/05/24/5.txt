It just doesn't sound like much of a problem (user logs in, passes some mucky data to rrdtool causing it to crash, the system is fine, that instance of rrdtool dies and gets cleaned up). No real trust boundary gets violated/no DoS in any meaningful way as I understand it. Unless an exploitable scenario comes to light I don't think this is an issue really.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  AYHNlLaUDdDsUmsQtRrF =jPkc -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
