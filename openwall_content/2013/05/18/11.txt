Normally yes, WP admin can modify the site and thus execute arbitrary PHP, so a remote flaw that allows php command execution only for admin would be a security flaw (e.g. worth of hardening) but not typically a security vulnerability (e.g. worthy of a CVE and full security treatment).  However in this case it is exploitable, the CSRF provides a vector for exploitation. So it's gets a separate CVE.  So please use for the WordPress plugin wp-cleanfix CSRF  And please use for the WordPress plugin wp-cleanfix Code Execution  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =jXn+ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
