Thanks.  File wpCleanFixAjax.php contains:  30         $command = strip_tags( $_POST['command'] ); 31         eval ( $command );  and there is:  12 if ( is_admin() && _wpdk_is_ajax() ) {  So it only work when logged in administrator. This is not a security vulnerability as is, because WordPress administrator can upload/edit PHP as she or he likes.  There is a CSRF vulnerability, which can be used to execute arbitrary PHP.  POST action=wpCleanFixAjax&command=echo phpversion();  So in short: two vulnerabilities, but eval can't be used without CSRF as far as I can tell.  --- Henri Salo  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
