Not too nice to send a CVE request without ANY coordination with us ...  Just for the record, you contacted us today reporting a bug which could be memory corruption and you didn't know if it could be exploited. Then I replied telling you that we discovered and fixed the bug two days ago and I then explained to you what the bug really was (wrong logic in the IO events handling code in our SSL layer). I then told you that we made snapshots with the fix applied AND that we has planned for a release on *Monday* with the fixes backported.  The snapshot mail, commit log and diffs makes the issue obvious, I just don't understand why you had to go and publish *RIGHT AWAY* a script on public lists after our mail exchange...  I'm not mad that you disclosed a bug, we're very open about it, and the git history is full of references to crash and security fixes, but it's just REALLY not nice how you handled this and are forcing me to do this release in a hurry rather than handling it with package maintainers.  Next time, please coordinate a little, just to be nice.   On Sat, May 18, at Jason A.
