I've just supplied a patch to that bug with a simple implementation for the common case where the signatures are distributed alongside the tarballs with a similar name, and are made by one of a small set of known keys.  It has some flaws, but it's certainly better than doing nothing.  I welcome review and/or feedback and suggestions on that bug report.
