Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in (1) apps/bookmarks/ajax/editBookmark.php via the "tag" GET parameter and in (2) apps/files/js/files.js via the "dir" GET parameter to apps/files/ajax/newfile.php in ownCloud 5.0.x before allows authenticated remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in (1) apps/bookmarks/ajax/addBookmark.php via the "url" GET parameter and in (2) apps/bookmarks/ajax/editBookmark.php via the "url" POST parameter in ownCloud 5.0.x before allows authenticated remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.  ## Credits The ownCloud Team would like to thank Mateusz Goik (aliantsoft.pl / / and Kacper R. (http://devilteam.pl / for discovering this vulnerabilities.  ## RESOLUTION Update to ownCloud Server or  ---------------  # Open redirector Web:  ## AFFECTED SOFTWARE - ownCloud Server <  ## RISK - Low  # CVE -  ## COMMITS - stable5:  ## DESCRIPTION Open redirect vulnerability in index.php (aka the Login Page) in ownCloud before allows remote attackers to redirect users to arbitrary web sites and conduct phishing attacks via a URL in the redirect_url parameter.  ## Credits The ownCloud Team would like to thank Mateusz Goik (aliantsoft.pl / for discovering this vulnerability.  ## RESOLUTION Update to ownCloud Server  ---------------  # Password autocompletion Web:  ## AFFECTED SOFTWARE - ownCloud Server <  ## RISK - Low  # CVE -  ## COMMITS - stable5:  ## DESCRIPTION Index.php (aka the login page) contains a form that does not disable the autocomplete setting for the password parameter, which makes it easier for local users or physically proximate attackers to obtain the password from web browsers that support autocomplete.  ## RESOLUTION Update to ownCloud Server  ---------------  # Privilege escalation in the calendar application Web:  ## AFFECTED SOFTWARE - ownCloud Server < - ownCloud Server <  ## RISK - High  # CVE -  ## COMMITS - stable5: - stable45:  ## DESCRIPTION Due to not properly checking the ownership of an calendar, an authenticated attacker is able to download calendars of other users via the "calendar_id" GET parameter to /apps/calendar/ajax/events.php  Note: Successful exploitation of this privilege escalation requires the "calendar" app to be enabled (enabled by default).  ## Credits The ownCloud Team would like to thank Mateusz Goik (aliantsoft.pl) for discovering this vulnerability.  ## RESOLUTION Update to ownCloud Server or  ---------------  # Privilege escalation and CSRF in the API Web:  ## AFFECTED SOFTWARE - ownCloud Server <  ## RISK - High  # CVE -  ## COMMITS - stable5:  ## DESCRIPTION Due to an insufficient permission check, an authenticated attacker is able to execute API commands as administrator. Additionally, an unauthenticated attacker could abuse this flaw as a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.  ## RESOLUTION Update to ownCloud Server  ---------------  # Incomplete blacklist vulnerability Web:  ## AFFECTED SOFTWARE - ownCloud Server < (running under Apache)  ## CVE IDENTIFIERS - TBD (already requested)  ## RISK - Critical  ## COMMITS - stable5:  ## DESCRIPTION Incomplete blacklist vulnerability in ownCloud before allows authenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code by uploading a crafted file and accessing an uploaded PHP file.  Note: Successful exploitation requires that the /data/ directory is stored inside the webroot and a webserver that interprets .htaccess files (e.g. Apache)  ## RESOLUTION Update to ownCloud Server  ---------------  # CSRF token leakage Web:  ## AFFECTED SOFTWARE - ownCloud Server <  ## CVE IDENTIFIERS -  ## RISK - Medium  ## COMMITS - stable5:  ## DESCRIPTION The configuration loader in ownCloud 5.0.x before includes private data such as CSRF tokens in a JavaScript file, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information.  ## RESOLUTION Update to ownCloud Server  -- ownCloud Your Cloud, Your Data, Your Way!
