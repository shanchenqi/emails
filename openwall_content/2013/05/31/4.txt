Made for ARM,  x86 and x64.| || |Abstract:| |=========| |The vulnerability is a denial of service which is caused by sending a  null byte in an HTTP request to the web server.| || |Report-Timeline:| |================| Discovered vulnerability via fuzzing| Vendor Notification| Vendor Response/Feedback| Vendor Fix/Patch| PublicDisclosure| || |Status:| |========| |Published| || |Affected Products:| |==================| |Monkey HTTPD - version || |Exploitation-Technique:| |=======================| |Remote| || |Details:| |========| |A bug discovered in Monkey's HTTP parser allows an attacker to cause a  segmentation fault in one of the daemon's threads using a specially  crafted request containing a null byte. An attacker can crash all the  available threads by sending the specially crafted request multiple  times, rendering the server useless for legitimate users.| || |Proof of Concept:| |=================| |The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attacker without any  special privileges. The placement of the null byte within the request  does not seem to have any effect on the result. The null byte may even  be used instead of an HTTP method such as, GET. Below is an example of  how this bug can be manually triggered:| || |ruby -e 'puts "GET /\x00 HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\n"'|netcat localhost || |Solution:| |=========| |This vulnerability has been fixed for the release.| || |Risk:| |=====| |The security risk of the redirection vulnerability is estimated as low(+).|  Commit code:   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
