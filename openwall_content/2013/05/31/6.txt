Use Mongo as WEB SCALE DOCUMENT STORE OF CHOICE LOL Step 2. Assume basic engineering principles applied throughout due to HEAVY MARKETING SUGGESTING AWESOMENESS. Step 3. Spend 6 months fighting plebbery across the spectrum, mostly succeed. Step 4. NIGHT BEFORE INVESTOR DEMO, TRY UPLOADING SOME DATA WITH "{$ref: '#/mongodb/plebtastic'" Step 5. LOL WTF?!?!? PYMONGO CRASH?? :OOO LOOOL WEBSCALE Step 6. It's 4am now. STILL INVESTIGATING pymongo/_cbsonmodule.c (Mike Dirolf /* Decoding for DBRefs */ Oh Mike!!!   3. ADD process_dbrefs=False TO ALL THE DRIVERS  To reproduce: ? in mongo shell: : {"$ref" : "whatever"} }); ? in python shell import pymongo  Fix:  BTW can someone from 10gen contact me so we can start doing the CVEs for MongoDB properly?
