Kurt: just to be clear, joepie91's attack didn't require javascript or link-clicking or anything of the kind, because it's an img src -- as long as your browser loads images automatically from non-origin hosts, it will trigger this behavior.  That said, I agree with Kurt's general assessment here: this kind of DoS is the nicest possible thing an attacker can do with a CSRF.  	--dkg   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
