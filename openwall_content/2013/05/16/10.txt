Attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code using eval() in wpCleanFixAjax.php with CSRF. I also noticed the plugin contains wp-cleanfix.php:  <script type="text/javascript" src="http://blog.wpxtre.me/widget/?<?php echo time() ?>"></script>  Tested:  Information posted originally 11 months ago, but eval() alone is not dangerous. Not sure if this should be or CVE.
