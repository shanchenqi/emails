However, CGI::Application does not reset header state automatically between FastCGI requests, and WebLogin was not modified to do so. In most situations, this caused no problems, since WebLogin overrode the previous header state with new values when answering the request. However, it did not do so when redirecting a user for REMOTE_USER authentication using the $REMUSER_REDIRECT WebLogin option.  Therefore, if WebLogin were configured with the $REMUSER_REDIRECT option and running under FastCGI, a user using REMOTE_USER authentication may receive WebLogin cookies intended for a previous user of the same FastCGI login.fcgi process, enabling them to authenticate to other web sites as the previous user. ----cut---------cut---------cut---------cut---------cut---------cut-----  Upstream advisory:   [1]  Versions affected: through Versions fixed:	   and later  Upstream patch for the issue is referenced at [2].   [2]  Even tought advisory says "For Debian and Ubuntu users, all versions of WebAuth with this vulnerability were only uploaded to Debian experimental and did not appear in any release. For Stanford users, no version of WebLogin with this vulnerability was ever deployed in production.", would it make sense nevertheless to assign a CVE to this issue?
