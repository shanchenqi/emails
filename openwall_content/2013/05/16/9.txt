An uprivileged user could use this flaw to cause denial of service (make libvirtd daemon to exhaust / reach the maximum count of open file descriptors, the libvirtd daemon process was allowed to open, possibly preventing other users from use of libvirtd services till the libvirtd daemon was restarted).
