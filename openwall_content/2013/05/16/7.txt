Nova did not implement checking for the virtual size of a qcow2 image used as ephemeral storage for instances. It is therefore possible for a user to create an image which has a large virtual size, but little data. Once the instance is created, the user can then proceed to fill the virtual disk, and consume all available disk on the host node file system.
