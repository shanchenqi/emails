That was probably the wrong decision, particularly based on Kurt's comments yesterday, so I probably should have gone ahead and done it and included it in the advisory.  I'm happy to include a CVE in the advisory and in the Debian experimental changelog going forward.  --  Russ Allbery (rra@...ian.org)               <http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/>  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
