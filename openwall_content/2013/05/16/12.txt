Ok and "joepie91" on reddit posted:   ====== It's a pretty basic (and more annoying than harmful) CSRF - basically, http://zpanel.whatever.com/?logout=anything will log out the user from a panel, no matter where it's called from. There's no logout key, and no referer checking.  Insert <img src="http://zpanel.whatever.com/?logout=anything"> on any site and anyone that visits the page will have their zpanel.whatever.com session killed instantly. ======  I can't verify this, but even if true it appears that there is no real trust boundary violation (user clicks the link, they get logged out, or JavaScript is used to trigger it, whatever). Unless someone can show otherwise not assigning a CVE for this issue.   - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  XyeIRmvH6XXyelL+WLq1 =Td1y -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
