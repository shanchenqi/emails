In certain scenarios, Google Authenticator login incorrectly determines the user's account name. The change in account name could cause the two-factor authentication for existing accounts to be lost, allowing users to log in using just username and password.  This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact while Google Authenticator login's additional verification is by-passed, a username and password are still required to log in.  One Time Password (OTP) replay  If an attacker can intercept a login request with a username, password and OTP, an attacker could use this same data again to login to the website.  This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker who can intercept a login request with this level of detail can usually also intercept the ongoing session identifying token.   can you send me the code patches fixing this so I can make sure it gets the correct SPLIT/MERGE treatment?
