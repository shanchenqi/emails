Details as follows:  1. libtiff (tiff2pdf): Stack-based buffer overflow with malformed image-length and resolution  A stack-based buffer overflow was found in the way tiff2pdf, a TIFF image to a PDF document conversion tool, of libtiff, a library of functions for manipulating TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) image format files, performed write of TIFF image content into particular PDF document file, when malformed image-length and resolution values are used in the TIFF file. A remote attacker could provide a specially- crafted TIFF image format file, that when processed by tiff2pdf would lead to tiff2pdf executable crash.  Reference:  2.  libtiff (tiff2pdf): Heap-based buffer overflow in t2_process_jpeg_strip()  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way tiff2pdf, a TIFF image to a PDF document conversion tool, of libtiff, a library of functions for manipulating TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) image format files, performed write of TIFF image content into particular PDF document file, in the tp_process_jpeg_strip() function. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted TIFF image format file, that when processed by tiff2pdf would lead to tiff2pdf executable crash or, potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the tiff2pdf binary.  Reference:  The enclosed bugs contains the relevant patches.  --  Huzaifa Sidhpurwala / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
