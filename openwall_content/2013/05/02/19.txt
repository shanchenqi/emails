Right.  And that's part of the problem with using existing PGP key signatures.  They don't convey the piece of information that the project probably actually cares about.  Open source projects rarely care that I'm *actually* Russ Allbery, rather than just using that name on-line while actually legally being named Roger McDowell.  Lawyers may care if they want to be able to sue me, but that's an edge case.  What projects actually care about is that I'm the same person, by whatever name, who has an established track record in multiple other projects and an established trust basis in the broader community.  You can kind of get there by tying together multiple different pieces of data, but it's certainly not directly conveyed by PGP key signatures.  --  Russ Allbery (rra@...nford.edu)             <http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/>  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
