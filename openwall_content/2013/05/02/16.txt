Some PGP publications try to avoid mentioning "trust" altogether: they talk about "[user ID] validity" and "ownertrust".  "User ID validity" is when you sign something with semantics similar to "I am reasonably confident that the key belongs to Simon McVittie whose address is smcv@...ian.org". That's what happens in keysigning.  "Ownertrust" is when you configure gpg with things like "if Simon says a user ID is valid, assume that it is" (full ownertrust), or "if Simon and two others with partial ownertrust all agree that a user ID is valid, assume that it is" (partial ownertrust).  Both of those are orthogonal to whether you can trust that I haven't deliberately included malicious code in a software package signed by my key, whether you can trust that I haven't accidentally included dangerously insecure code in that package, or whether I even have the authority to be saying "this is a release" on behalf of the project from which it purports to be a release.
