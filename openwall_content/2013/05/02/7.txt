A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted device input that, when processed would lead to gpsd's packet parser crash (gpsd daemon termination).  References: [2]  Candidate upstream patches [*]: [3] [4]  -- [*] Candidate because upstream is private currently:     => hard to say     if [3] is fixing this issue, or the DoS would be caused     by the malformed packet crash / sample, as listed in [4].      @Eric - Eric, could you please help us to solve this doubt? (which of the patches is the correct one to fix the above mentioned DoS / security issue)  Thanks: Goes to Miroslav Lichvar for bringing this one to my attention.  Kurt, could you allocate a CVE identifier for this?  Thank you && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
