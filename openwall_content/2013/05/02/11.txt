Oh, I'm not muddled, I was using the word "trust" as it appears (34 times) in RFC - mostly relating to "Trust Signature" and "Trust Packet".  And if you seriously think someone who searches for my public key on a webserver, or through mail, or business card, etc, downloads my public key from one of the servers, imports it into their own pubring, signs it with their own private key, then mails it to me, or uploads it to one of the key servers, all without trusting me in any way, then I'll show you a pretty awful stalker (and fairly inefficient one, due to the need to sign my pubkey), a fan boy (which is hardly likely to happen in my case), or someone who is rather sad. (I'm discounting impaired judgement due to the baroque processes involved here, sorry xkcd).  i.e. no-one goes to that kind of trouble just to say "I know this person" - that's what facebook and google+ are for.
