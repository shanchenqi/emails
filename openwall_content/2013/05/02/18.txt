Though for many open source projects, having a passport or other government id is not the sort of identity we care about - knowing that you're the person who does git/hg commits under that e-mail address is what we care about - if it's a pseudonym that doesn't match your passport, that doesn't affect whether we accept code from you or not.   (The lawyers might care, when it comes to verifying who owns copyright and agreed to release code under a given license, but that's a whole separate mess to unravel.)  --  	-Alan Coopersmith-              alan.coopersmith@...cle.com 	 Oracle Solaris Engineering - http://blogs.oracle.com/alanc  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
