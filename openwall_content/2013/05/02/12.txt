I believe there is some confusion because people don't usually think that a flight simulator could be accessible from a "remote" location.  Is the following correct?  1) The Flightgear package includes a network server.  This server can be run using fgfs.exe and specifying a port number using the "-telnet" argument, for example.  2) The format string problem is in the server.  3) Your exploit makes a connection to the server (on port  4) The exploit sends a number of format strings in the cloud names (using the "property tree").  For some reason, it sends the same command 5 times, and it sends this command for "layers" 1 through 5.   5) The exploit causes the server to crash.  - Steve  >-----Original Message----- >From: Andrés Gómez Ramírez [mailto:andresgomezram7@...il.com] >Sent: Thursday, May 02, AM >To: kseifried@...hat.com >Cc: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com >Subject: Re: [oss-security] Flightgear remote format string > >> >> So it's not on by default?
