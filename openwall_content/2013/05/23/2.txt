Lane" <bcl@...hat.com> To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: livecd-tools: improper handling of passwords    The livecd-tools package provides support for reading and executing Kickstart files in order to create a system image. It was discovered that livecd-tools gave the root user an empty password rather than leaving the password locked in situations where no 'rootpw' directive was used or when the 'rootpw --lock' directive was used within the Kickstart file, which could allow local users to gain access to the root account.  Please note that livecd-tools is also used by appliance-tools to create images used for virtual machines, USB based systems, and so on. Additionally, the Python script components of livecd-tools have been broken out into a separate package named python-imgcreate on some distributions (such as Fedora).
