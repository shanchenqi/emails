Given that affected code is identical, I don't believe differences in other parts of codebases not related to the flaw should force split.  I.e. I'd follow:  AB4) If there are multiple products, vendors, distributors, or users of the same core codebase, then DO NOT SPLIT based solely on distinguishing between products.  Additionally, the same code was also found embedded elsewhere:   I don't think we want to give every project embedding that source a separate CVE id.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
