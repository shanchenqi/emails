A network intermediary could use this vulnerability to bypass TLS verification and perform a man-in-the-middle attack. The Debian security team has allocated for this vulnerability.  This vulnerability is fixed in telepathy-gabble [0]. All versions since 0.9.x are believed to be vulnerable. The patch described below is likely to apply to all affected versions without modification.  If you use an unencrypted connection to a "legacy Jabber" (pre-XMPP) server, fixed versions of telepathy-gabble will not connect to that server until you make one of these configuration changes:  • upgrade the server software to something that supports XMPP 1.0; or • use an encrypted "old SSL" connection, typically on port   (old-ssl); or • turn off "Encryption required (TLS/SSL)" (require-encryption).  Since the vulnerable code is in a git submodule, distributors with tarball-based builds for telepathy-gabble will need to apply a patch with suitably adjusted paths. A suitable patch[1] is available from the Telepathy bug report[2]. Distributors who will patch the Wocky submodule directly can take the patch from the git commit[3].  In the current development branch, versions to are vulnerable; the upcoming release will fix this vulnerability.
