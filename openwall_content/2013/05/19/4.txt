We discovered the CVE request at the same time as everyone, on two public lists along with a script that allows any kiddie to trigger it... sent by a package maintainer we had talked to minutes ago to explain the issue and who knew the fix release was two days away.  Anyway, what's done is done, we released earlier, hopefully we get a bit more coordination next time.  Hopefully, we don't need too many CVE request anyways ;-)  --  Gilles Chehade  https://www.poolp.org                                          @poolpOrg  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
