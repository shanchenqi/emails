For future reference you can get CVEs privately, although if you're not the official upstream this means there is a greater chance of duplicates (and thus of me saying "no, make a public request). So if you want to do this a possible compromise is to email me and the upstream and if upstream replies that it's ok then I'd probably go ahead.  >> Just for the record, you contacted us today reporting a bug which >> could be memory corruption and you didn't know if it could be >> exploited. >  > The quote was "I haven't looked into why this happens or if memory  > corruption / code execution is a possibility, but at the very > least, it's a nasty DoS." >  >> The snapshot mail, commit log and diffs makes the issue obvious >  > Which is why I figured it was already a public issue, and > therefore not an issue to track it with a CVE.

Agreed, generally with public source code commits fixing an issue we consider it public and in general I would assign a CVE publicly, otherwise it gets to complicated to track/ensure embargoes/etc.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =81ky -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
