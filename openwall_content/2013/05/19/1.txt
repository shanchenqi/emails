Sorry about that. I was in the midst of bumping packages in gentoo to the snapshot where you had fixed the issue, when I figured it might be wise to also get the issue tracked with a CVE asap.

The quote was "I haven't looked into why this happens or if memory corruption / code execution is a possibility, but at the very least, it's a nasty DoS."  > The snapshot mail, commit log and diffs makes the issue obvious  Which is why I figured it was already a public issue, and therefore not an issue to track it with a CVE. But apologies, nonetheless, for jumping the gun. I'll coordinate with you more closely in the future.
