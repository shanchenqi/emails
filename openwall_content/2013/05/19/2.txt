Trying to sort them out  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1  So the head of the zPanel project "ballen" ("Bobby Allen" according to Google) reports:   ====== 4) Security issues raised The security issues mentioned in the following article (http://imgur.com/a/lzRuo) are already fixed, however we are a short way off being able to release the new version. All known security vulnerabilities have been announced on here with fixes and guides. ======  I'm unable to find this list or a dedicated security page (apart from a list of 4 security features at http://www.zpanelcp.com/about/features/#tab-1-3).  Can you please send me that list with URLs and ideally source code commits so we can get CVE #'s assigned to the zPanel vulnerabilities? Alternatively if anyone in the community wants to do it that'd be great as well. Thanks in advance.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =mKa/ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
