Donenfeld" <Jason@...c4.com> To: oss-security <oss-security@...ts.openwall.com> Cc: cgit@...ts.zx2c4.com Subject: CVE Request: cgit directory traversal  Hi Kurt,  As mentioned in early messages to oss-sec, I've inherited maintainership of the cgit codebase and am gradually auditing it. Today I found a nasty directory traversal:  http://somehost/?url=/somerepo/about/../../../../etc/passwd  This should be pretty straightforward to categorize.  Exploitation looks like: http://data.zx2c4.com/cgit-directory-traversal.png  I've committed a fix for it here:  And this fix will be in the master branch and a new release will be made soon.  Cgit by default is not vulnerable to this, and the vulnerability only exists when a user has configured cgit to use a readme file from a filesystem filepath instead of from the git repo itself. Until a release is made, administrators are urged to disable reading the readme file from a filepath, if currently enabled.  Thanks, Jason  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
