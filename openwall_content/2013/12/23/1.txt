As well some of these issues (in this case both I think) are still under embargo/not public so I can't always release details when they are being publicly rejected.  > those of us who are not focused on CVE as much, but may > nevertheless be interested in findings about the actual security > issues.

If you want to see what security related bugs Red Hat products have you can simply search our BZ for products and use look for the  keyword "Security". Not clear what looking up CVE's that have been rejected due to errors/etc. has to do with this?  > Thanks, >  > Alexander >    - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  Ec7b0lALoSMKevnOWmQT =meBi -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
