As far as we can tell, the use of cleartext credentials is an intentional design choice to support the "Post via e-mail" feature described on the http://codex.wordpress.org/Settings_Writing_Screen web page. Essentially, this feature requires the ability to send USER and PASS commands outbound to a POP3 server during unattended operation. The USER and PASS arguments must be sent as cleartext. Therefore, the product must have the cleartext credentials at connection time. Although one could envision an alternative approach in which the stored credentials are reversibly encrypted, we don't feel that that's been established as a design requirement. Similarly, one might argue that the product should not be using this specific outbound POP3 approach to control posting, but it seems reasonable that there was customer demand for this.  > Also, this functionality can be used as backdoor.

With XSS code, with black SEO links, with > malware code, etc.  This seems to mean that, after a compromise, an attacker could decide to use the "Post via e-mail" feature instead of one of the other posting options. This does not seem to cross privilege boundaries, and the availability of the "Post via e-mail" feature does not seem to be an implementation mistake. We don't happen to know whether "XSS code" is any easier to insert when using "Post via e-mail" posting instead of another type of posting. However, in WordPress, an admin typically has the unfiltered_html capability anyway (see the http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities web page).  Admittedly, there is some risk in supporting stored "Post via e-mail" data that perhaps is entered by only a tiny fraction of legitimate customers, and might be missed during an incomplete cleanup from a compromise. However, "might be missed during an incomplete cleanup" situations are not really within the scope of CVE.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =VTS5 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
