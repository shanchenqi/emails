A small side note on this CVE: David Bremner found that gitolite previous to that commit also was vulnerable to a local filesystem information leak: Depending on the user umask running gitolite setup, he might create world readable files in the repositories, in particular the gitolite-admin one.  As example in the Debian packaging postinst, [1] would result in a world-readable /var/lib/gitolite3/repositories/gitolite-admin.git.   [1]  But this actually might not need a separate CVE for this issue (altough different versions are affected, if I understand it correctly both fall under Incorrect Default Permissions?).
