That's not consistent with guidance I've seen in the past - if update is released claiming to fix some issue without actually fixing it, new CVE is needed.  Not doing so leads to inconsistent security update data with two different updates or package versions of the same component being listed as fixing the same CVE.  Release text can probably explain id reuse, and consider it sufficient for human consumption, but it's probably more upsetting to tools processing machine readable versions of update notifications (e.g. OVAL).  > Here, it seems that the first patch might help with a situation in > which the attacker doesn't have complete man-in-the-middle access, but > the attacker can replace the server.

Previous patch makes it more difficult for MITM attacker to perform their attack, as they can no longer intercept all connections, but they need to let certain connections pass through and intercept other.  > If the above analysis is incorrect, and there are absolutely no cases > in which the original patch had any security benefit, we will reject > one of the two CVEs.  As mentioned above, I believe the fact that 0.9 was previously announced to fix should be sufficient to trigger new CVE assignment regardless of how incomplete the original fix is.
