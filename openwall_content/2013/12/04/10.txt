The zdnet article quotes a statement from AMD of:  Also, this marginal erratum impacts the previous four generations of AMD Opteron processors which include the AMD Opteron and "Shanghai",) ("Istanbul",) and ("Lisbon" and "Magny-Cours") series processors.   None of these generations are the "Jaguar Architecture" Family 16h identified in the erratum description from  Furthermore, Matt Dillon appears to be under the impression that he found erratum  It therefore appears that the original MITRE email was incorrect as identifying the two links (refering to and nearly 2 years old judging by as related to (whos errata document's inital release was June of this year).
