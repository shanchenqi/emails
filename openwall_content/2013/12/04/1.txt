Hi,  I was looking at and it looks like upstream Horizon got assigned (referenced in the bug).  also references this Launchpad bug, but does not reference a CVE.  Secunia references  references the Launchpad bug and the Secunia advisory, but has a different CVE. The only reference I found to was the RedHat bug.  Is simply a duplicate of or were these supposed to be split out for some reason?
