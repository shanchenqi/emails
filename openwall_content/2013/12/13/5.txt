The way certificate check was implemented to fix was incorrect (check was done on "probe" connection, but not the actual connection used to transfer data).  This should now be fixed in (I can't confirm atm), which switches to use urllib3 with proper certificate checks.  https://github.com/transifex/transifex-client/issues/42  This should get a new CVE.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
