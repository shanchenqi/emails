Typically, this array is created by scanning for YML files (in config/locales for a Rails app). With I8n.enforce_available_locales set to true, we check that the locale we're trying to use (eg. translate or localize) is included in the available_locales. This means we're certain it can't be malicious user submitted data even outside of the scope of a Rails app.  I could really use a hand with the CVE announcements, I literally have no idea about any of this!
