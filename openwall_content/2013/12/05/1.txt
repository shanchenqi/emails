Hello,  talks about an upgrade feature in hplip downloading (via HTTP) a binary and executing it. Is a CVE needed for that?  Along with the versions in the hplip and hplip3 versions I looked at did not have the upgrade.py file in the source (newer version like had it in the source but the RPM spec file looks to remove it at build time, so it is not provided in the binary RPMs).
