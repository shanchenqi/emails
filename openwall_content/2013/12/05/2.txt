This is not documented anywhere I can find.  3) I checked the source code:  [kseifrie@...alhost find ./ -type f  | xargs grep HPLIP_PATH ./upgrade.py:HPLIP_PATH=None ./upgrade.py:        HPLIP_PATH=a ./upgrade.py:        if HPLIP_PATH is not None: ./upgrade.py:            if os.path.exists(HPLIP_PATH): ./upgrade.py:                download_file = HPLIP_PATH ./upgrade.py:                log.error("%s file is not present. Downloading from Net..." %HPLIP_PATH) ./upgrade.py:                HPLIP_PATH = None ./upgrade.py:        if HPLIP_PATH is None:  Again no documents. Not even a hint (e.g. --help listing command line options)   Definitely CVE worthy. Please use  for this issue.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  ZVFYJfBrO9VWQmUSyh2r =f8h2 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
