Or did you intend to make it public?  I’m assuming that since you are asking about a CVE here, you maybe did not mean to keep it private?  Your other message said your bug contained upstream URLs (so maybe even pasting those here would be helpful). >  > Once I can look at it, I can let you know for sure whether or not it is the same issue (and should then use the same CVE).  I have moved the bug to our Security Incidents product, so it should be visible now.
