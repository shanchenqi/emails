The rationale sent to upstream was:  'We don't think we'll be able to assign a CVE number for the announcement. As far as we can tell, the announcement is about introducing an optional new security feature. An example of a type of issue that could have a CVE assignment is: ... a third party ships a product based on Asterisk ... this product implements an external control protocol that is capable of calling the SHELL and FILE functions with untrusted user input ... the third party publishes a security announcement stating that the new release of their product ships with a revised asterisk.conf containing a "no" value for the "live_dangerously" option, in order to fix this vulnerability ... We would generally assign one CVE number for each such security announcement, if any are found.'  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJStGRFAAoJEKllVAevmvmsT7sH/jG+t0zvQPHnDdQNWzta/dOX =zlC7 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
