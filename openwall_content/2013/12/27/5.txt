Comment 11 in says "typing away at the lock screen will now trigger the unlock dialog (and redirect input to the password field)." Does this mean that is a security fix, and the other screenShield.js commits are usability fixes? Or does it mean that is a security fix because the "will be dropped in the void" description isn't always accurate, and "will be dropped into the Activities panel" or "will be dropped into the 'Enter a command' dialog box" can occur instead?  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =XmWl -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
