In Jacob Amey from Security Inspection, Inc. opened a new  issue #30 [2] exposing the three different security vulnerabilities he  found. One of them was classified as High while the last two were as  Medium.  In I released the new version fixing the first one,  that is the one that was classified as High. The security vulnerability  was described as "Arbitrary Command Execution" and the function affected  was 'handle_request()'. I left the other two vulnerabilities to be fixed  in the next version that was almost ready to be released.  In I released the new version which included fixes for  the remain two security vulnerabilities discovered by Jacob Amey in the  same issue #30.  These two security vulnerabilities fixed in were described as "Web  Server Generic Cookie Injection" and "Web Server Generic XSS" as stated  in the issue #30 and the function affected was again 'handle_request()'.  [3]  Since it seemed that the fact I put a link in the news pointing to BID  added some confusion, I've recently updated the news in the  Monitorix web site to make things as clear as possible. [4]  Thank you very much. Best regards.
