Are these followup postings still on topic for oss-security, or should this possibly be discussed elsewhere and, if necessary and when ready, summarized for/on oss-security as well (e.g., in the form of a revised security advisory)?  I am not sure, and as a co-moderator I am wondering if/when we should start rejecting messages in this thread that are CC'ed to oss-security by non-subscribers.  I'd appreciate advice.  This is actually part of a more generic issue: whenever an upstream project posts a security advisory CC'ed to that project's list(s) and to oss-security, we often end up getting followup postings by users of the project's software who are not into security and thus comment on non-security aspects.  This is sometimes fine and maybe even desirable, but sometimes it gets too far off topic for oss-security, and it's often difficult for moderators to decide when to start rejecting.  A better approach may be for upstream projects to be sending such announcements to their lists and to oss-security separately, not by CC'ing. (I actually asked OpenStack to start doing that a while ago, and I guess they're doing it that way now.)
