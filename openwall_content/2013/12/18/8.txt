This doesn't affect GnuPG 2.x as libgcrypt does blinding by default.  The acoustic attack leveraged some particulars of GnuPG by zero-padding input to force modular reductions in GnuPG's RSA implementation. GnuPG now cripples this lever by normalizing MPIs used as inputs to secret key functions.  This secondary mitigation measure was introduced in GnuPG and libgcrypt (relevant for vendors shipping GnuPG 2.x).  --mancha   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
