MITRE, in general, can't take responsibility for doing original research on every diff of every product to determine what changes are vulnerability fixes. Possibly we, or others, could suggest a guess in case someone more familiar with the product can quickly confirm or reject that. So, here is a guess offered with VERY LOW confidence:  The paste also includes:  >  function expandall() >  { > 	$userid = get_userid(); > -	$contentops = cmsms()->GetContentOperations(); > -	$all = $contentops->GetAllContent(false); > -	$cs = ''; > -	foreach ($all as $thisitem) > +	$hiermanager = cmsms()->GetHierarchyManager();  suggesting that expandall is now done in a different way. The source code says:  > $lang['admin']['expandall'] = 'Expand All Sections';  so maybe it's possible that incorrect expandall behavior has some relationship to the visibility of private "Section headers" referenced in In other words, if expandall is done unsafely, maybe the information produced later by the display_content_list function can contain unintended section headers if there's a URL manipulation (adding "&expandall=1" or whatever). If any of this is relevant (and, quite possibly, it's not), this would seem consistent with the vendor's "minor security issue" wording.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJSwYteAAoJEKllVAevmvmsHPkH/iPq6iwsAwATjeernEUqi7oF =GyJT -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
