If a client makes an invalid request with SASL credentials, it will initially fail. However if you issue a second request with bad SASL credentials, it will authenticate. This has now been fixed.".  The upstream bugreport is at [2], with the corresponding commit fixing this issue at [3].   [1]  [2]  [3]  Could a CVE be assigned to this issue?
