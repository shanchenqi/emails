Examples: >     >      When a vulnerability originally came into existence through a single action of a single developer, we currently don't like to assign multiple CVE IDs on the basis of the vulnerable code later being shipped in many separately maintained products. We can enter an internal issue report about the effect on CVE usability because of this "difficult to coordinate" observation.  > PoC: http://example.com/wp-content/plugins/flash-player-widget/dewplayer.swf?mp3=http://example.mp3 > PoC: http://example.com/wp-content/plugins/advanced-dewplayer/dewplayer.swf?mp3=http://example.mp3  Just to clarify: the dewplayer.swf file is thought to be essentially the same in these two cases, and you're asking for two different CVE IDs to be assigned? It seems very unlikely at this point that we can provide more than one CVE ID for those, but we just wanted to confirm that we're answering the right question.  > Q: Does content spoofing issues normally get CVE as the risk is probably > minimal?  If we think the vendor's security policy is that dewplayer.swf should not be able to reference off-site media files in this way, then the issue is currently eligible for a CVE assignment. We're not sure that a spoofing impact would be the primary motivation for changing this. Perhaps a stronger motivation is that the vendor doesn't want dewplayer.swf to trigger arbitrary outbound TCP traffic from the web host, possibly including traffic to intranet servers in some environments.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =ykRj -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
