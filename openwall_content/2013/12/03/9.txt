This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier  Versions Affected:  and all later versions Not affected:       2.3.x Fixed Versions:      Impact  ------  Strings sent in specially crafted headers will be cached indefinitely.  This can cause the cache to grow infinitely, which will eventually consume all memory on the target machine, causing a denial of service.  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the work arounds immediately.   Releases  --------  The & releases are available at the normal locations.   Workarounds  -----------  Users who cannot upgrade may apply this monkey patch as an initializer to work around the issue:  ``` ActiveSupport.on_load(:action_view) do   ActionView::LookupContext::DetailsKey.class_eval do     class << self       alias :old_get :get        def get(details)         if details[:formats]           details = details.dup           syms    = Set.new Mime::SET.symbols           details[:formats] = details[:formats].select { |v|             syms.include? v           }         end         old_get details       end     end   end end ```  Patches  -------  To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series.  They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.   * 3-0-header_dos.patch - Patch for 3.0 series  * 3-1-header_dos.patch - Patch for 3.1 series  * 3-2-header_dos.patch - Patch for 3.2 series  * 4-0-header_dos.patch - Patch for 4.0 series   Please note that only the 4.0.x and 3.2.x series are supported at present.  Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.
