To be clear I asked Mitre for the CVE for AMD (since it's not open source software). I didn't think to tell them it was embargoed since the AMD release notes and so on were public. However in future with hardware related CVE's I'll make sure to ask Mitre to keep them private if the software side is still embargoed as appropriate.   - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =ncvQ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
