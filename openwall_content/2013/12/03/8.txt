A simplified reproducer is in the pixman patches with another reproducer in the Launchpad bug. The xorg  xorg-server - exa: only draw valid trapezoids The patch was submitted in October but doesn't seem to be applied yet, so I'm CC'ing xorg_security. Patch references the pixman f.d.o bug, but doesn't seem to have an associated xorg bug.
