Well, that depends on what you mean by "fixed".  If somebody depended on "we'll just mmap the page(s) that contained the partial and unaligned resource", then current git is very very broken, because it doesn't allow that at all.  But if you meant that somebody could mess with things and try to access crud *around* a non-page-aligned resource, then current git fixed that and no longer allows mmap's that expose other resources aside from the one explicitly managed by uio.
