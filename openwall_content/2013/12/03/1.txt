Cashdollar" <larry0@...com> To: "oss-security@...ts.openwall.com" <oss-security@...ts.openwall.com> Subject: Command injection vulnerability in Ruby Gem sprout  Title: Command injection vulnerability in Ruby Gem sprout  Download: http://rubygems.org/gems/sprout, http://projectsprouts.org/  Vulnerability:  The unpack_zip() function contains the following code:   60           zip_dir = File.expand_path(File.dirname(zip_file)) 61           zip_name = File.basename(zip_file) 62           output = File.expand_path(dir) 63           # puts ">> zip_dir: #{zip_dir} zip_name: #{zip_name} output: #{output}    "      64           %x(cd #{zip_dir};unzip #{zip_name} -d #{output})   If the attacker can control zip_dir, zip_name or output then they can possibly  execute shell commands by injecting shell meta characters as input.    PoC:  For example: filename;id;.zip  I contacted the developer a few weeks ago but received no response.   Thanks! Larry W.
