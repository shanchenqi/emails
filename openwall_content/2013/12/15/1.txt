The primary purpose of the SDK is to provide an easy-to-use Ruby environment enabling developers to authenticate a user, retrieve data, and upload data/results from their own analysis to BaseSpace." >  > Vulnerability: The API client code passes the API_KEY to a curl command.  This exposes the api key to the shell and process table.  Another user on the system could snag the api key by just monitoring the process table.  >  > In the following code snippet: >  > >  # +headers+:: Header of the PUT call. >  # +trans_file+:: Path to the file that should be transferred. >  def put_call(resource_path, post_data, headers, trans_file) >    return %x(curl -H "x-access-token:#{@..._key}" -H "Content-MD5:#{headers['Content-MD5'].strip}" -T "#{trans_file}" -X PUT #{resource_path}) >  end >  >  > Vendor: Notified >  > Advisory: http://www.vapid.dhs.org/advisories/bio-basespace-sdk.html   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
