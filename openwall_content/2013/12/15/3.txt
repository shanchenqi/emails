To have two CVEs assigned in response to two different patches for the same security problem, it's generally necessary for the first patch to fix some aspect of the problem. If the first patch accomplished nothing, a total of only one CVE is used.  Here, it seems that the first patch might help with a situation in which the attacker doesn't have complete man-in-the-middle access, but the attacker can replace the server. In that case, the attacker perhaps can't avoid having the probe connection and the later connection go to the same server. Because of that, checking only the probe connection might have a security benefit.  (https://github.com/transifex/transifex-client/issues/42 says "MITM attacker should be able to steal all transferred data by allowing "probe" connection opened by verify_ssl to connect to the real transifex server and only intercept subsequent urllib2 connection.")  Use for the vulnerability in the "actual connection used to transfer data."  If the above analysis is incorrect, and there are absolutely no cases in which the original patch had any security benefit, we will reject one of the two CVEs.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =hLDC -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
