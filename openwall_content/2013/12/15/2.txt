It might be the same as this part of the distribution:  swift/common/manager.py    def setup_env():   ...   os.environ.setdefault('PYTHON_EGG_CACHE', '/tmp')  http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/swift/tree/swift/common/manager.py  http://www.openstack.org/projects/openstack-security/ says "How to Report Security Issues to OpenStack ... Open a bug in Launchpad and mark it as a 'security bug'. This will make the bug Private and only accessible to the Vulnerability Management Team." We don't know whether that has been done. It may be inapplicable because the information isn't private.  Use for this report about OpenStack Swift. Again, is not an ID for which setuptools is the affected product.  > Google search: >  > PYTHON_EGG_CACHE "/tmp" filetype:py  This seems very useful, but it's not a type of information that MITRE is interested in working with at this exact moment. At first glance, the Google search results seem to include all of the following:    - cases in which something equivalent to     "os.environ.setdefault('PYTHON_EGG_CACHE', '/tmp')" is used within     code that's intended for distribution as a "product"    - cases in which something equivalent to     "os.environ.setdefault('PYTHON_EGG_CACHE', '/tmp')" is used within     other types of code such as site-specific code or example code    - cases in which setting PYTHON_EGG_CACHE would not actually occur     (comments, documentation, discussion, etc.)  We can assign CVE IDs for the first category, i.e., cases in which someone has identified this as a security problem within a specific software product.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
