Corrected explanatory text to refer to the correct patch filename.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  An internal flag is used to temporarily suppress IOMMU TLB flushes, in order to consolidate multiple single page flushes into one wider flush.  This flag is not cleared again, on certain error paths.  This can result in TLB flushes not happening when they are needed. Retaining stale TLB entries could allow guests access to memory that ought to have been revoked, or grant greater access than intended.  IMPACT ======  Malicious guest administrators might be able to cause host-wide denial of service, or escalate their privilege to that of the host.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Only VMs which have been assigned PCI devices can exploit the bug.  Only systems using Intel VT-d are vulnerable, since the bug is in the VT-d specific code in Xen.  Xen 4.2.x and later are vulnerable. Xen 4.1.x and earlier are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  This issue can be avoided by not assigning PCI devices to untrusted guests on systems supporting Intel VT-d.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.  xsa80.patch                Xen 4.2.x, Xen 4.3.x, xen-unstable  $ xsa80*.patch  xsa80.patch $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =rB23 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment "xsa80.patch" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
