Filesystem path information leak --------------------------------  First up, we have a vulnerability that allows people to find the install  path of Plone on a server. I can't actually think of any attacks that  happen with this, but we had a CVE assigned for it before so I'm  requesting another.  Details, including source links are at:        Privilege escalation through exposed underlying API ---------------------------------------------------  Plone's searching infrastructure is based on CMF's, which is based on  Zope's. Plone wraps the search API with additional filters for  permissions and expired content. One of the methods that allows  searching wasn't so wrapped, so people who can write untrusted Python  can gain access to content they aren't authorised to. In addition, this  can accidentally expose information.  Details, including source links are at:           In addition, we are releasing two patches to vulnerabilities in Zope  today. Can somebody advise if these should be merged?   Reflexive XSS in browser_id_manager -----------------------------------  Zope's session infrastructure includes a method for encoding URLs, which  is accessible through the web. By passing HTML into this method a  reflexive XSS attack can be achieved.  Details, including source links are at:        Reflexive XSS in OFS.Image --------------------------  Zope's image objects include a method for generating tags, which allow  for arbitrary classes to be included. This method is accessible through  the web and these classes are not sanitised, so the image tag can be  broken out of and arbitrary HTML included.  Details, including source links are at:        Thanks for your attention,  Matt    Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
