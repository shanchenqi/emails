It is possible to execute malicious code with these options, and we want to prevent the security risk of acking through a potentially malicious codebase, such as one downloaded from an Internet site or checked out from a code repository.   The --pager, --regex and --output options may still be used from the global /etc/ackrc, your own private ~/.ackrc, the ACK_OPTIONS environment variable, and of course from the command line.  The relevant commit seems to be   (plus some adjusting the testsuite).  Reference in the Debian Bugtracker:    See also which contains further restrictions to the command line options.  Could a CVE be assigned to this issue?
