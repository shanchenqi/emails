Cashdollar, @_larry0  Download: http://rubygems.org/gems/webbynode   Vulnerability Description:  The following code located in: doesn't fully sanitize user supplied input before passing it to the shell via %x.  Messages via the growlnotify command line can possibly be used to execute shell commands if the message contains shell meta characters.  def self.message(message)   if self.installed? and !$testing     message = "")     %x(growlnotify -t "#{TITLE}" -m "#{message}" --image "#{IMAGE_PATH}")   end end  The message.gsub regex strips ANSI encoded characters from the #{message} variable, it doesn't strip characters like ;&| etc. If the attacker can control the contents of #{message}, #{TITLE} or #{IMAGE_PATH} they can possibly inject shell commands and execute them as the client user.
