This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the permission "Administer EU Cookie Compliance popup".' Our perspective is that, typically, web applications do not have a threat model in which crafted configuration settings entered by admins are a vector that qualifies for a CVE assignment. You, in the context of representing the "vendor" of the module, are allowed to have that threat model if you want to. (This is entirely reasonable if an XSS attack would realistically result in privilege escalation to a higher-level admin account.) If you want to reconsider, we can optionally reject this CVE for you. Otherwise, it will remain a valid (and non-disputed) CVE.
