First, core: - Drupal core - Multiple vulnerabilities   - "Multiple vulnerabilities due to optimistic cross-site request forgery protection (Form API validation - Drupal 6 and 7)": Correct me if I'm wrong, but I read this as a single vulnerability in the underlying core CSRF prevention code; it manifests differently based on the user-created ("contrib") callbacks that employ it.  - "Multiple vulnerabilities due to weakness in pseudorandom number generation using mt_rand() (Form API, OpenID and random password generation - Drupal 6 and 7)": Not sure if further classification of this one is necessary.  - "Code execution prevention" for the "files" directory .htaccess for Apache: Execution of local code.  - Access bypass in security token validation (as performed by drupal_valid_token() ).  - Cross-site scripting in Drupal core's Image module.  - Open redirect in Drupal core's Overlay module.  Now the contributed modules: - Invitation - Access Bypass  - EU Cookie Compliance - Cross Site Scripting (XSS)  - Organic Groups - Access bypass  - Entity reference - Access bypass  - OG Features - Access bypass  Thanks!
