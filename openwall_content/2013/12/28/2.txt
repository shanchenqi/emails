The joernchen advisory mentioned only to_json, and therefore to_xml has a different discoverer and may require a separate CVE ID.  If there is a denial of service issue involving :delete, please let us know and we can assign an additional CVE ID. The joernchen advisory mentioned only "renders JSON requests with a full JSON object," and therefore :delete has a different discoverer and may require a separate CVE ID.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =PZmt -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
