The issue is that the built-in HTTP server failed to adequately sanitize  request strings of malicious JavaScript. So by leveraging this issue, an  attacker may be able to inject arbitrary cookies. The same issue could  also cause arbitrary HTML and script code to be executed in a user's  browser within the security context of the affected site. Input passed  via requests to the "handle_request()" function (lib/HTTPServer.pm) is  not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be  exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser  session in context of an affected site.  Can a CVE be assigned to this issue?  --  Regards,  Ratul Gupta / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
