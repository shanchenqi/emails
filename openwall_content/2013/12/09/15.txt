It is possible to have a CVE ID for multiple unspecified vulnerabilities but this can usually only occur when the expectation is that no details will be available. In this case, a previous message said:  >> From: Kurt Seifried <kseifried@...hat.com> >>  >> Just a heads up I know at least one person is trying to get details >> from SourceFire (they bought ClamAV some time back). Until I can match >> issues up I can't assign CVEs.  suggesting that some information gathering may be in progress.  Although these items:  >> 1) A double-free error exists within the "unrar_extract_next_prepare()" >> function (libclamunrar_iface/unrar_iface.c) when parsing a RAR file. >>  >> 2) An unspecified error within the "wwunpack()" function >> (libclamav/wwunpack.c) when unpacking a WWPack file can be exploited to >> corrupt heap memory.  can have CVE IDs, we can't correctly define the scope of any CVE ID until more is known about what was fixed in For example, in some cases, two different double-free issues fixed in would be covered by a single CVE ID.  So, it is probably best to wait a short time for the information gathering.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJSplJmAAoJEKllVAevmvms+dkH/inM5aP+TvcychU/CygZUIBo =hkx8 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
