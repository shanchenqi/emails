After hashing the user's password with crypt(), pam_userdb compares the  result to the stored hash case-insensitively with strncasecmp(), which  should be avoided, as it could result in an increased possibility of a  successful brute-force attack.  Can a CVE be assigned for this?  --  Regards,  Ratul Gupta / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
