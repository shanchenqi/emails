In order to process native DSO in .egg distributions the content of the file is unpacked. By default Python unpacks the files to $HOME/.python-eggs however this 'egg cache' directory can be overwritten by setting the environment variable PYTHON_EGG_CACHE.  It is common practice to set this to a world writeable directory such as /tmp in the instances where the user the process is executing as does not have a home directory (e.g. httpd). Unfortunately the extraction is done in such a way that the extraction path for the DSO is deterministic. As such it exposes a TOCTOU attack vector where a user my pre-emptively injecting a specially crafted DSO to achieve arbitrary code execution and potentially privilege escalation.  The current version of setuptools attempts to mitigate this threat by a number of additional integrity checks in conjunction with issuing a warning if the extract directory is group or world writeable.  This fix was introduced in version of Python setuptools (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#id48).  The discovery of this issue can be attributed to Dhiru Kohlia and myself.  - - Grant. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with Thunderbird - http://www.enigmail.net/  =Sifa -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
