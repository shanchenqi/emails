If there was a patch to try and fix it, then a release, then a new patch to fix it for real and a new release  that would definitely get a new CVE. If there was a patch, then a new patch, but no official release in between it's a grey area.   - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  RbZlQLnZArxSrItpZYVZ =IGxK -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
