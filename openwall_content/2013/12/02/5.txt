The following was reported to us, but had been reported upstream last year.  It was reported [1] that Samba's pam_winbind module would fail open (allowing access) when the require_membership_of option is used as an argument to pam_winbind, and contains a non-existent group as the value.  In such a configuration, rather then failing and not permitting authentication which is what would be expected, pam_winbind will allow authentication to proceed.  For instance, if the following is specified and the user is not a member of the group 'Admin', they will not obtain access to the system:  auth        sufficient    pam_winbind.so use_first_pass require_membership_of=Admin  On the other hand, if the non-existent group 'AdminOops' is specified, the user is obviously not a member of said group, authentication will be permitted:  auth        sufficient    pam_winbind.so use_first_pass require_membership_of=AdminOops  The commit [2] that most likely introduced this flaw indicates that this was introduced October and another commit [3] looks like the fix, although that is for another bug [4] that's somewhat related to this issue and somewhat not.  [1] [2] [3] [4]   Could a CVE be assigned to this issue?  --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
