This is a reference to this message:    This was sent by MITRE as part of the CVE assignment.  It seems likely to us (the Xen Project security team) that the CVE assignment was a consequence of our embargoed predisclosure to xen-security-issues.  The effect of this has been that we have had to end the embargo early. I think there is room for discussion here about whether we all did the right thing.  In particular:   * Should the Xen Project security te4am have treated this issue with    an embargo at all, given that the flaw itself was public ?   * Should we have anticipated that other software would be in a    similar position and sent message(s) to some other suitable set of    vendor(s) ?  Which vendors, and how ?   * Should MITRE have been asked /not/ to publicly disclose the    relationship between and AMD CPU erratum    until the embargo ended ?   * Were we right to treat MITRE's message as a trigger for disclosure ?
