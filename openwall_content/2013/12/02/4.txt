They have been used internally at Red Hat and partially disclosed privately, if they were Red Hat only I'd recycle them, but with some external use I don't want to run the risk of making a mess.  In the first case we had multiple issues in a program, two of which in later investigation turned out not to be exploitable, ditto for the third one.  Please REJECT the following CVEs:     Thanks.   - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =Gr4s -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
