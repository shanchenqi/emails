I would say this depends on the level of public disclosure. For example from "upstream" (AMD) there was a very limited disclosure (no public announcement I'm aware of) and just some notes in a single PDF. However this was also made public via the person who found it and then picked up by ZDnet in an article, so I would personally count that as quite public.  > * Should we have anticipated that other software would be in a  > similar position and sent message(s) to some other suitable set of  > vendor(s) ?  Which vendors, and how ?  Yes and no, with hardware obviously it's likely that other software will leave the bug exposed, the problem is finding all of it and notifying people is a very non trivial task.  > * Should MITRE have been asked /not/ to publicly disclose the  > relationship between and AMD CPU erratum until > the embargo ended ?  That was my fault, I didn't think to ask them to handle this as a private assignment since the issue was quite public/old (see above).  > * Were we right to treat MITRE's message as a trigger for > disclosure ?  Don't know.  > Thanks, Ian.   - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  qPROKaphfmISa4AwZSTp =r3rU -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
