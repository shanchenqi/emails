By generating EC2 credentials using a trust-scoped token, a trustee may retrieve a token not scoped to the trust, therefore elevating privileges to all of the trustor's roles. Only Keystone setups enabling EC2-style authentication are affected.  Icehouse (development branch) fix:  Havana fix:  Notes: This fix will be included in the icehouse-2 development milestone and in a future release.
