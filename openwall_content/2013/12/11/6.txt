In order to ensure full traceability, we need a CVE number assigned that we can attach to further notifications. This issue is already public, although an advisory was not sent yet.  """ Title: Nova live snapshots use an insecure local directory Reporter: Daniel Berrange (Red Hat) Products: Nova Affects: Grizzly and later  Description: Daniel Berrange from Red Hat reported that the directories used to temporarily store live snapshots on Nova compute nodes were writeable to all local users. A local attacker with shell access on compute nodes could therefore read and modify the contents of live snapshots before those are uploaded to the image service.
