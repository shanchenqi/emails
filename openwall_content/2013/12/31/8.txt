Just for clarification, the "denial of service" theory was related to:     specifically:     -  resources :users, :id => /\d+/ do    +  resources :users, :id => /\d+/, :except => [:index, :destroy] do  and:     -   it "recognizes and generates #destroy" do    -      { :delete => "/users/1" }.should route_to(:controller => "users", :action => "destroy", :id => "1")    +    it "doesn't recognize #destroy" do    +      { :delete => "/users/1" }.should_not be_routable  in which a reader might infer that a "destroy" of some data associated with a user account would be a denial of service.  Our understanding now is that the presence of ":destroy" in the added code string:     , :except => [:index, :destroy]  does not prevent any type of attack, and therefore it is not a vulnerability fix.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =RNUF -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
