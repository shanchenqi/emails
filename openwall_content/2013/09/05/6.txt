We do have someone who is supposed to forwarding security bugs from security@...nel.org to distros.  I'm not on distros but apparently this wasn't happening properly so we've recently assigned another person to help with this.  We're reviewing our security policies for the during the kernel summit, in October btw.  So far the main points are that people want less secrecy and more public reviews and better testing.  Kees wants to keep a record of CVEs in the kernel.   It's not clear if anything will actually change though.  regards, dan carpenter  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
