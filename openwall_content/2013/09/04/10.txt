I'm curious about this.  If, say, a modern TLS library some day decides to get around to implementing (old, deprecated, known-insecure, previously-unimplemented) SSLv2, and announces it as a feature, and enables it by default, is the consensus of this group that we would not treat it as worthy of a CVE, despite being a clear security weakening?  At what point does the security community override the upstream decisions and declare the packages vulnerable?  	--dkg   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
