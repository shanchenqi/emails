Please understand that I'm very uninterested in changes to the UI though, and I'd be much (much) happier if UI and core were split into two different components.  > In the "customers accessing provider's Nagios" scenario, I suppose that > the customer might be interested in seeing "application is running" but > not, say, "the snmpd that ties this machine to the provider's NMS is > acting up" ... >  I agree. The problem is that with access to the host comes access to commands that affect all services on that host as well, so it's not necessarily as clearcut as "disable viewing here and we're done", if one wants to do things properly.  --  Andreas Ericsson                   andreas.ericsson@....se OP5 AB                             www.op5.se Tel: +46                  Fax: +46  Considering the successes of the wars on alcohol, poverty, drugs and terror, I think we should give some serious thought to declaring war on peace.
