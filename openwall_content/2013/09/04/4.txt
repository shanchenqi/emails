Since you do seem to be willing to ponder the system of access rights and its security implications: I haven't checked the 4.x prereleases yet, does being authorized to see a host's information still necessarily provide access to *all* services on it?  In the "customers accessing provider's Nagios" scenario, I suppose that the customer might be interested in seeing "application is running" but not, say, "the snmpd that ties this machine to the provider's NMS is acting up" ...
