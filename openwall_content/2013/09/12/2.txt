When I reviewed our packages, I followed several of the memory-allocation multiplications far enough to convince myself that integer wraparound was possible, though perhaps the example I selected for the CVE request is not an actual problem.  I have also attached an email I sent directly to the openjpeg developers with suggestions for further enhancements that did not feel worty of a CVE request. I'm including it here in the hopes that it is useful to someone.  I did not receive any replies from the openjpeg developers; as far as I know, no patches are available, and I personally will not be taking the time to prepare patches.  If someone does take the time to prepare patches, I'd like to suggest writing several wrappers around malloc() to handle the common memory allocation cases so the size validation can be performed in a handful of routines rather than scattered through the codebase.  Thanks to Huzaifa Sidhpurwala for his assistence deciphering my request.
