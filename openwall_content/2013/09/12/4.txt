By sending any random text longer than 65K characters to an instance console and requesting the console log contents through the API, an authenticated user may disrupt the nova-compute node his instance is running on. This vulnerability could be leveraged in a Denial of Service attack against the cloud provider. Only Folsom and Grizzly setups using Qpid as their RPC backend are affected. Havana setups, or setups using other RPC backends (like RabbitMQ), are all unaffected.
