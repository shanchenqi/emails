Nifty, from the RFC:     The specification    includes two types of parameter sets: sequence parameter set and    picture parameter set.  An active sequence parameter set remains    unchanged throughout a coded video sequence, and an active picture    parameter set remains unchanged within a coded picture.  The sequence    and picture parameter set structures contain information such as    picture size, optional coding modes employed, and macroblock to slice    group map.     To be able to change picture parameters (such as the picture size)    without having to transmit parameter set updates synchronously to the    slice packet stream, the encoder and decoder can maintain a list of    more than one sequence and picture parameter set.  Each slice header    contains a codeword that indicates the sequence and picture parameter    set to be used.     - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =QDoo -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
