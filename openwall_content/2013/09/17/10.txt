Does anyone know if there's published research into this topic?  I could  only find indications that the specification does not adequately defend  against brute-force password guessing.  Which is probably true, but not  exactly my concern.  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
