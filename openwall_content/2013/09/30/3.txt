ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The emulation of the fbld instruction (which is used during I/O emulation) uses the wrong variable for the source effective address. As a result, the actual address used is an uninitialised bit pattern from the stack.  A malicious guest might be able to find out information about the contents of the hypervisor stack, by observing which values are actually being used by fbld and inferring what the address must have been.  Depending on the actual values on the stack this attack might be very difficult to carry out.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest might conceivably gain access to sensitive data relating to other guests.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen 3.3.x and later are vulnerable.  Only HVM guests can take advantage of this vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only PV guests will avoid this issue.  There is no mitigation available for HVM guests.  We believe this vulnerability would require significant research to exploit.  CREDITS =======  Jan Beulich discovered this issue.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.  xsa66.patch             Xen 4.2.x, Xen 4.3.x, xen-unstable   $ xsa66.patch  xsa66.patch $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =PSEF -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment "xsa66.patch" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
