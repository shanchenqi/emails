Indeed. But I think the whole approach is wrong. Attempts to conduct format-specific comparing are futile for several reasons:  1) when you are against a state level adversary (and we are talking about targeted attacks from organizations like NSA, right?) you are better not to try to parse anything complex, like file and objdump do (e.g. crashing objdump is quite easy);  2) you cannot really determine format of a file (think GIFAR);  3) an elaborate script which knows many formats is going to be complex and to contain a lot of bugs which is bad in any security context.  Examples for the item 3:  - checks like "/usr/bin/file $2 2>/dev/null | grep ELF" are not strict enough because file sometimes shows pieces of metadata which is controlled by an attacker;  - in a script from opensuse -- at least ".*" in html cleaning permits to pass any html through;  - some files are not checked at all: jars in the script from redhat and created.rid in the script from opensuse (.rid extension is not in my /usr/share/mime/packages/freedesktop.org.xml so format will be determined by the OS from content).  --  Alexander Cherepanov  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
