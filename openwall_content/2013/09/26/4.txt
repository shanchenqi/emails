A dangling pointer access flaw was found in the way qemu handled hot-unplugging virtio devices.  This flaw was introduced by virtio refactoring and exists in the virtio-pci implementation.  When the virtio-blk-pci device is deleted, the virtio-blk-device is removed first (removal is done in post-order).  Later, the virtio-blk-device is accessed again, but proxy->vdev->vq is no longer valid (a dangling pointer) and kvm_set_ioeventfd_pio fails.  A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the qemu process on the host system, causing a denial of service to it and any other running virtual machines.
