The vendor reported an issue where a remote user could execute arbitrary code as the x2go user, apparently by leveraging a setgid executable which did not have a hardcoded path to "libx2go-server-db-sqlite3-wrapper.pl". [1] is the commit fixing the vulnerable code, [2] is the upstream release announcement.  Thanks, Chris Reffett   [1] [2]   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
