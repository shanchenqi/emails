We do realize that currently contains one CVE ID.  Our current thought is that BREACH is not a vulnerability in the HTTPS protocol, and instead should be considered a vulnerability class. In this view, there would be one CVE for each independent codebase that can be successfully attacked using the BREACH exploit methodology.  As a vulnerability class, BREACH is somewhat similar to the XSS vulnerability class. They are both about limitations on what a web site can safely do with untrusted client input:    Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) - your web site must   not take arbitrary markup strings from a client and include   them verbatim in an HTML document within an HTTP response    Cross-site duplicate compression (XSDC, aka BREACH) - your web   site (sometimes) must not take arbitrary strings from a   client and include them verbatim in the input to a compression   algorithm used for an HTTPS response  (This is just a way to outline why we think that the one-CVE-per-codebase approach makes sense. It doesn't mean that MITRE is necessarily in favor of adopting this "XSDC" terminology.)  MITRE is not currently seeing many reports in which the BREACH issue is being associated with an affected codebase of a specific web application. Maybe the only public example is the OWA codebase mentioned in the original BREACH paper:     (Yes, we realize that BREACH exploitation, in general, depends both on details of the web application and on details of the web-server configuration. As a practical matter, the details of the web application are very likely to be the limiting factor on the overall population size of exploitable web sites.)  There are other reports indicating that other types of products can or should be fixed because they contribute to the possibility of a successful BREACH attack against a specific web application, but no specific web application is identified, e.g.,  Open source:       Non-open source:      https://techzone.ergon.ch/breach_mitigation  There is nothing yet suggesting that a huge number of CVEs will ultimately come out of this.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =dn4Z -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
