The description from NVD and OSVDB says the vulnerability is cross-site scripting:       Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Graphite before     allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via     unspecified vectors.       Graphite contains a flaw that allows a remote cross-site scripting     (XSS) attack. This flaw exists because the application does not     validate certain unspecified input before returning it to the user.     This may allow an attacker to create a specially crafted request     that would execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser within     the trust relationship between their browser and the server.   However, the checkins from the project appear to use this CVE for unsafe use of Python's pickle module:       This release contains several security fixes for cross-site scripting     (XSS) as well as a fix for a remote-execution exploit in graphite-web          ...      Fix insecure deserialization of pickled objects   MITRE, please advise.
