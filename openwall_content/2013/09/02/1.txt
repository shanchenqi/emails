Based on what you sent, we are not sure whether XSS is an independent vulnerability in this plugin. Is there a usable XSS attack that does not require a CSRF vulnerability, and does not require that the admin intentionally enter an XSS attack string during an authenticated session?  The SQL injection:    name="custom_query" value="1=1) union select  is something that we would typically expect is an independent vulnerability. A person who has admin access within a web interface is not necessarily authorized to execute arbitrary SQL statements. We found this code that seems to be relevant:    http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/indianic-testimonial/trunk/testimonial.php          if ($_template_data['custom_query']) {         $filter_by = " AND ({$_template_data['custom_query']})";       }        $_testimonial_result = $this->wpdb->get_results(       "SELECT * FROM {$this->wpdb->prefix}inic_testimonial WHERE (id NOT IN(" .       implode(",", $_current_featured_testimonial_id) . ")){$filter_by}       ORDER BY {$_template_data['ord_by']} LIMIT {$_no_of_testimonial}");  So, the outcome at this point is:    IndiaNIC Testimonial plugin 2.2 for WordPress    CSRF:           Use   SQL injection:  Use   XSS:            no CVE assigned; waiting for other information that                   XSS is an independent primary vulnerability here  MITRE's CVE team does not do vulnerability coordination, but we think this disclosure process is not what the vendor would have preferred:    - Email sent to IndiaNIC   - Notification left on the plugin's Support board on wordpress.org  Please see the "For a WordPress plugin security issue, email plugins [at] wordpress.org" step listed on the http://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_Security web page.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =u0kJ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
