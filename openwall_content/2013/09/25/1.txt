I hope I am not nitpicking, but the whole idea behind reproducable builds is to avoid trojaned rpm's, I guess.  I was checking the rpm-compare how it actually is doing the compre and you have:  [...]                 base=`basename $f`                 objdump -d rpm1/$f | grep -v $base > dump1                 objdump -d rpm2/$f | grep -v $base > dump2                 diff -u dump1 dump2 > /dev/null                 if [ $? -ne 0 ] ; then                           echo "File disassembly differs $f"                           cnt=`expr $cnt + 1`                 fi [...]  for ELF files and doing a for other file types. My concern is that attackers could construct a package that contains function-names that match the basename of the binary that you are checking. The "grep -v" will remove that, leaving a clean compare for injected code like 'call $base' etc. That would leave a wrong feeling about equal binaries.  regards, Sebastian  --   ~ perl self.pl ~ ~ krahmer@...e.de - SuSE Security Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
