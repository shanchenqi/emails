Ensuring Reproducible > Builds is a big task and I want your feedback, ideas, code and support.  In openSUSE we have reproducible binaries to a certain extend. That project was started some years ago with different (non-security) intentions. Since the build service rebuilds packages automatically if any depending package changes, a way was needed to avoid publishing new rpms if the build result result didn't actually change. So there are now some scripts that automatically run at the of a new build and determine with some heuristics whether the new rpms match the old rpms¹. You can see the output of that script in every build log in openSUSE:Factory.  cu Ludwig  https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/openSUSE:Factory/build-compare  --    (o_   Ludwig Nussel   //\   V_/_  http://www.suse.de/ SUSE LINUX Products GmbH, GF: Jeff Hawn, Jennifer Guild, Felix Imendörffer, HRB (AG Nürnberg)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
