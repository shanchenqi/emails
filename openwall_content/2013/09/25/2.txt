ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  When a guest increases the set of extended state components for a vCPU saved/ restored via XSAVE/XRSTOR (to date this can only be the upper halves of YMM registers, or AMD's LWP state) after already having touched other extended registers restored via XRSTOR (e.g. floating point or XMM ones) during its current scheduled CPU quantum, the hypervisor would make those registers accessible without discarding the values an earlier scheduled vCPU may have left in them.  IMPACT ======  A malicious domain may be able to leverage this to obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys from another domain.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen 4.0 and onwards are vulnerable when run on systems with processors supporting AVX and/or LWP.  Any kind of guest can exploit the vulnerability.  In Xen through as well as in Xen 4.1.x XSAVE support is disabled by default; therefore systems running these versions are not vulnerable unless support is explicitly enabled using the "xsave" hypervisor command line option.  Systems using processors supporting neither AVX nor LWP are not vulnerable.  Xen 3.x and earlier are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  Turning off XSAVE support via the "no-xsave" hypervisor command line option will avoid the vulnerability.  CREDITS =======  Jan Beulich discovered this issue.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.  xsa62.patch                 Xen 4.2.x, 4.3.x, and unstable             Xen 4.1.x  $ xsa62*.patch   xsa62.patch $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =Qbk6 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment "xsa62.patch" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
