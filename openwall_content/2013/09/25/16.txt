This was found by Paul Lhussiez and reported to us at        <https://github.com/leonnnn/pyxtrlock/issues/8>    Commit containing the fix, and security release announcement:                 All versions before release 0.1 or git commit are vulnerable.  â˘ Incorrect return value checking after calling XCB library functions   led to the program seemingly starting up normally, but leaving the   keyboard or mouse not actually locked in case the xcb_grab_*()   functions returned an error. There would be no indication for the user   that one of the input devices is not locked.    Commit containing the fix, and security release announcement:                 All versions before release 0.2 or git commit are vulnerable.  Could CVE-IDs be assigned for these, please?      -- Leon.
