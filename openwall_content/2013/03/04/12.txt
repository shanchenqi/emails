I think there's a difference between disclosing the vulnerability and  disclosing it with a related exploit. The first one allows to fulfill what  Michael Gilbert explains without the consequences that you focus on.  And as Michael Gilbert insisted on, I deeply think that the asymmetry of the  problem should be taken into account for defining the way of dealing with  security flaws.
