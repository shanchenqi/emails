You know why we will not do that, sorry.  > Optionally, also notify linux-distros a few days before the commit.  We don't usually have "days" before things are committed.  We find out about a problem, we make up a fix, and it is committed.  Usually all within 1-2 days.  Sometimes things take longer to fix, but usually it's prettty fast.  > > > Overall, I think we should bite the bullet and accept sko's > > > notifications to linux-distros, with a grace period of up to 7 days. > > > Whenever a distro is ready to release an update, they should be able to > > > insist on doing so within another 1 day, even if the initially planned > > > grace period would expire later.

As far as I am concerned, I trust linux-distros to manage this in a sane and proper manner, and they can notify the world when they decide to do so.  If that trust is somehow broken, we can revisit the issue in the future.  thanks,  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
