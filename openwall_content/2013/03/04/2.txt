Reconsider just what specifically?  You bring up a bunch of issues that the distros need to consider, what can the Linux kernel security team do differently?  We were asked to notify the linux-distro list, and now we will be doing that.  Should we not and just go back to how things were before?  > Overall, I think we should bite the bullet and accept sko's > notifications to linux-distros, with a grace period of up to 7 days. > Whenever a distro is ready to release an update, they should be able to > insist on doing so within another 1 day, even if the initially planned > grace period would expire later.  Would sko be OK with this?  Greg?  Again, I don't think anyone that is part of security@...nel.org minds about having the issues publicized, after linux-distro has their time to get things fixed and to their users.  If the linux-distro people care about that, that does not seem to be a security@...nel.org group issue, right?  totally confused,  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
