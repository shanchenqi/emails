Sorry yeah I should have been more clear.

I simply will require an original source, in this case the year is probably wrong.  > Is there really a problem at all?

Yeah, and people can post them to the list. As stated before, I assign a lot of CVEs. One minute extra per CVE is about 20 hours a year. It adds up. So from now on I'll be needing original source confirmation in the emails to oss-sec.  > Best wishes, Mike >    - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =trUJ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
