It also includes functionality to chroot Apache into the virtualhost document root prior to processing HTTP requests.  After processing each request, mod_ruid2 returns to its initial starting state. For uid/gid changes this is done using linux capabilities. For chroot, this is done by following a file descriptor that leads outside of the chroot.  In versions of mod_ruid2 before the filedescriptor used to break out of the chroot is inherited by all Apache subprocesses. This allows CGI scripts to also to break out of the chroot by performing a fchdir() across the inherited file descriptor.
