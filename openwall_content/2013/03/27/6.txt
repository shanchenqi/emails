It is a topic for oss-security, but less so for kernel-hardening.  Anyone on kernel-hardening who is interested in this topic should join oss-security.  Just drop kernel-hardening from further replies.  On Wed, Mar 27, at Corey Bryant wrote: > I'll plan on updating http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/tools with > anything it doesn't already have.
