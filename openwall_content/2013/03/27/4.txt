I have a list below to get started.  If anyone has any input, I'd  appreciate it!  I'll plan on updating http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/tools with  anything it doesn't already have.  pscan ----- Scans C/C++ source code for problematic uses of printf style functions  rats ---- Rough auditing tool for security.  A general purpose scanner for  detecting potential security problems in a wide range of languages.  flawfinder ---------- A general purpose scanner for finding and reporting upon potential flaws  in both C and C++ source code  Valgrind -------- Detect many memory management and threading bugs, and profile your  programs in detail  KEDR ---- Provides runtime analysis of Linux kernel modules including device  drivers, file system modules, etc  kmemcheck, kmemleak ------------------- Linux Kernel debugging features for detecting memory issues  Smatch ------ A static analysis tool for C  Coverity -------- Provides static analysis tools for C, C++, and other languages (requires  license, Red Hat has one)  Coccinelle ---------- A tool for matching and fixing source code for C, C++, and other languages  Clang ----- Static analysis tool for C/C++  Metasploit ---------- Used for identifying security issues. It includes many capabilities,  including fuzzer support  Trinity ------- A Linux system call fuzzer  fsfuzzer -------- File system fuzzer  scapy ----- Network packet fuzzer  --  Regards, Corey Bryant   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
