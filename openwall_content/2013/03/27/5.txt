There are two versions in existence:  1.x - @pentestmonkey's quick and dirty with some hacks by me trunk - a full blown privesc check framework designed by me with contributions  from the other two, it has multiple modes of operation, a standard library  which can be leveraged for new checks and (already) enhanced capabilities.    Its not perfect yet, I still need to clean it up and port it to the commercial  UNIX platforms we support but it should give a good idea of where we're going  Once I've stabilised the API of trunk, it will become 2.x and we'll open it up  formerly for contributions.  It's on Google Code if people want to take a look:  * http://code.google.com/p/unix-privesc-check  Tim --  Tim Brown <mailto:tmb@...35.com>  Download attachment "signature.asc " of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
