Sumit Bose discovered that FreeIPA's directory server (dirsrv) would segfault if an unauthenicated user attempted to connect to it with a missing username/dn.  According to RFC connecting without specifying the username/dn is valid.  This issue only affects FreeIPA 3.1 and 1.3.x; earlier versions do not have the vulnerable code.
