It's my real name.  You can imagine what my childhood was like.   "Hey Cashdollar got change for a dollar?" - No sorry I only carry big bills. "Hey Cashdollar can I have a dollar?" - No go get a Job. "Hey Cashdollar got any cash?".... Eh...geez.  I was told by my father that it was an American Indian name from the tribe 'Paycheck'.   A more realistic answer is it might be dutch for kirchtoller, and was mangled to Cashdollar.  I make up random answers normally when people ask like, I am in the witness protection program etc... I'll spare you the rest at this point. ;-)  -- Larry Content of type "text/html" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
