Christey" <coley@...re.org> To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: Temporary Notifications of New CVE Entries During NVD Outage   As some people know, the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is having a temporary outage.  At http://nvd.nist.gov/, NIST says "We are working to restore service as quickly as possible."  Many people rely on NVD feeds to learn about newly-updated CVEs.  The CVE web site does not provide such feeds, since that would duplicate NVD functionality.  However, the CVE project sends notification emails for newly-updated CVEs to a limited set of CVE-compatible users, often several times a day.  Until NVD service is reliably restored, I will be posting these "CVENEW" messages to the Vulnerability Information Managers (VIM) list.  While CVENEW messages do not contain the extra data that NVD provides, such as CVSS and CPE names, hopefully this will help some people to monitor new CVEs.  CVENEW messages will be found in the VIM archives at:       Note that the VIM list is not the place to post general vulnerability  announcements; it is specifically for maintainers of vulnerability  databases and information services, who use VIM to discuss accuracy  problems and other challenges in the post-disclosure analysis of  vulnerability announcements.  This is only a temporary action for the convenience of the security community.  We will disable the CVENEW announcements to the VIM list once NVD service has been restored.
