Yes. I know vendors (like us) hand out USB keys at events (I think most of ours are live bootable systems, so we should probably make sure that users can safely plug them in without hosing their systems if they want to look at what is on it =).  > There is only some precedence in the CVE DB, but not much. >  > I stumbled over this fix from one of my colleagues where a > specifically made USB device reporting the "cdc-wdm" USB class > could cause a kernel heap overflow. >  > "Malicious attached devices" might fall into several categories: >  > 1.
