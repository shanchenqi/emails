I apologize in advance if Oracle has assigned a CVE for this issue, but they haven't communicated it to anyone, so in future this problem can easily be avoided by simply posting the assigned CVE to OSS-Security and everyone will know.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =Wtjr -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
