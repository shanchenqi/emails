While it is a problem for the distros, I have generally had the perspective that it is ultimately their responsibility to track which portions of a CVE are fixed, and when.  Note - the more fundamental problem here is that CVE is being used much earlier in the disclosure process than it used to be, and it's basically being used as a universal bug ID.  I strongly encourage the Linux community to consider adopting their own ID scheme.  I made comments similar to this a couple years ago, but I can't easily find the reference right now.  - Steve   -----Original Message----- From: Solar Designer [mailto:solar@...nwall.com]  Sent: Thursday, March 07, AM To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: Re: [oss-security] CVE Requests (maybe): Linux kernel: various info leaks, some NULL ptr derefs  Kurt -  On Thu, Mar 07, at Kurt Seifried wrote: > Bundling the following into a single CVE: [...] > Please use for these issues.  I think this is wrong.  I would understand if those issues were all in the same subsystem at least (or if you assigned per-subsystem CVE IDs for these), but this is not the case.  Many distros will fix some, but not the others, or not all at the same time.  There's room for a little bit of bundling here, but not that much.
