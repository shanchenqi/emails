It  occurs during parallel invocation of the install_user_keyrings &  lookup_user_key routines, for the same user, if `uid' and `uid-session'  keyrings are not yet created.  An unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system, resulting in  DoS.  Upstream fix: -------------   ->  Reference: ----------   ->  Thank you. -- Prasad J Pandit / Red Hat Security Response Team DB7A D3F9 7CD1 B5EB   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
