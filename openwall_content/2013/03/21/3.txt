Anybody having access to a MantisBT instance (including anonymous users on web-facing applications) may issue a search query on the View Issues page; if a filter combining some criteria and a text search with 'any condition' is applied, the generated SQL will results in a potentially huge cartesian product which, depending on the size of the underlying database, has the potential to bring down the site/db server as it runs out of resources.  The root cause of this behavior is joining a table with a from clause and setting the join's criteria in the query's where clause, without taking consideration the operator's precedence (AND/OR).  Full details about this issue can be found in our bugtracker [1].  A patch for this issue is available [2] in the project's repository on Github, and will be included in MantisBT version which we expect to release in a couple of weeks once testing is completed.
