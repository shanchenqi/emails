The CVE assignment process is never intended to introduce unnecessary delays to the publication of vulnerability information.  Merely noting whether CVEs have already been requested should reduce most of the risk of duplicates without forcing people to delay publication.  - Steve   >-----Original Message----- >From: Solar Designer [mailto:solar@...nwall.com] >Sent: Wednesday, March 20, PM >To: larry Cashdollar >Cc: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com; kseifried@...hat.com >Subject: Re: [oss-security] Ruby CVEs > >[snip] >Overall, I think all of you have tried to do the right thing, and I >would not want to have information withheld from this list merely to >avoid duplicate CVE IDs in the future.
