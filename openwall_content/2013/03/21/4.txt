When connecting to a host that has a mismatched hostname in the certificate, does not warn that there is a problem with the certificate.  For versions that implemented SSL certificate verification, but did not properly handle the mismatched hostname case (e.g. the series prior to this has been assigned  Please note that should not be used for older versions that supported SSL, but did not implement any kind of certificate verification at all. No CVE identifier has been assigned to this problem.  Version which fixes this issue, is available via the project's SourceForge page [1].  In the new code, host certificate checking is turned off. To turn it on, add '-verifycert' to the command line. The checks will include the hostname.
