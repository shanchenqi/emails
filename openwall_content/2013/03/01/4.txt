I might have been not clear, but I was merely speaking of *already known* security issues, not âto be classified (or not)â ones. I do know classification is hard, but if I understand correctly:  - there are issues which are known to be security ones at commit times - some of them have been sent before to security@k.o - some of them have not because subsystems maintainers don't want (like networking) to go through that alias (why?)  I was merely speaking of those latter issues.
