It's not easy but definitely do-able. It can be rather tiring too. Someone needs to be proactive, and make this happen. Petr has worked with me for a few years, and I think he can do this.  I also want to bring back my cve-tagged kernel tree. I'm willing to work with any distro's security team who is willing to supply me with the CVE names, and the relevant commits/references. Talk to me if you are interested...  Eugene   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
