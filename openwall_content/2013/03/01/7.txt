However, this does only apply if you deploy arbitrary   untrusted apps on you server. Very unlikely for us but still I thought   it was worth to inform you.  It fixes a security issue, but unless you're on a shared environment it's not a grave issue. It allows an application process to delete an arbitrary file, even a file it does not have permi ssion to, but only during application startup (i.e. during evaluation of config.ru). Once the application is started, it cannot be exploited, so external visitors cannot influence this. If  you deploy arbitrary untrusted apps on your server then this issue can be a problem. If all your apps are trusted (e.g. because your organization wrote) them then there's no problem.  Unquote  I am not sure this warrants a CVE.
