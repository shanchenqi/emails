I suggest upgrading to spring to mitigate these flaws.  * Jenkins included:  jenkins.war (unzip) - -> WEB-INF/plugin/maven-plugin.hpi (unzip) - ->  This copy of xerces is vulnerable to I have tested with a reproducer and confirmed it is vulnerable. The flaw relates to how xerces processes the SYSTEM identifier in DTDs. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once parsed by an application using xerces, would lead to a denial of service (application hang due to excessive CPU use). This would be exploitable on jenkins so long as an attacker can somehow provide an XML file that jenkins will process using the vulnerable copy of xerces. It seems to me that this would be possible, but I could be wrong.  Either way, upgrading to xerces >= will resolve this flaw:  http://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/releases.html  =============================================  So three more reasons to update =)  Also does anyone know if kk@...suke.org is the correct email for Kohsuke Kawaguchi or if there is a better one?  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =oomf -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
