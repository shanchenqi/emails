Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE Request -- roundcubemail: Local file inclusion via web UI  modification of certain config options  Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,    RoundCube Webmail upstream has released and versions to correct one security flaw:  A local file inclusion flaw was found in the way RoundCube Webmail, a browser-based multilingual IMAP client, performed validation of the 'generic_message_footer' value provided via web user interface in certain circumstances. A remote attacker could issue a specially-crafted request that, when processed by RoundCube Webmail could allow an attacker to obtain arbitrary file on the system, accessible with the privileges of the user running RoundCube Webmail client.
