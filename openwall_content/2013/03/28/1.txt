From http://www.splint.org/ "Splint is a  tool for statically checking C programs for security vulnerabilities and  coding mistakes. With minimal effort, Splint can be used as a better  lint. If additional effort is invested adding annotations to programs,  Splint can perform stronger checking than can be done by any standard lint."  Cheers.
