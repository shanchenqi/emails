Sounds nice.  This is the first security audit tool on the  > list so if we could add more in this category that would be nice.  There is also openscap if you are wanting security auditing. http://www.open-scap.org/page/Main_Page  You can get SCAP content from various places.  As far as tools, I often look at the collection at the owasp web site: https://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=Phoenix/Tools  web scarab and sqlmap are good.  There are lots of tools here as well: http://securitytools.wikidot.com/penetration-vulnerability-ids-ips  There are so many tools, its hard to find the ones that are well maintained.  Many are good at first and then bit rot over the years.  -Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
