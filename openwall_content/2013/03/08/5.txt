It sounds like Mitre will be handling the additional CVEs for this issue as I understand it.  Now my question is how concise do we go with the Linux kernel as far as subsystems go? E.g. file subsystem vs network subsystem seems obvious, and say ext4 vs. MSDOS file system code seems obvious but what about network drivers (same chipset? same maker, different chipsets? or like ext2 vs ext3 vs ext4).  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =BGxQ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
