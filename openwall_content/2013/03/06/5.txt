(The CVE identifier will be assigned later.) We strongly recommend to upgrade ruby. Details  When reading text nodes from an XML document, the REXML parser can be coerced in to allocating extremely large string objects which can consume all of the memory on a machine, causing a denial of service.  Impacted code will look something like this:  document = REXML::Document.new some_xml_doc document.root.text  When the `text` method is called, entities will be expanded. An attacker can send a relatively small XML document that, when the entities are resolved, will consume extreme amounts of memory on the target system.  Note that this attack is similar to, but different from the Billion Laughs attack. This is also related to of Python.  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the work arounds immediately.  =====  Please use for this issue. I apologize in advance if a CVE was requested through other channels but we need a CVE for this ASAP.
