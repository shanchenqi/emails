I need some help here in other words.  Sure thing; I'm not asking you to go through that list. It's just that it is a kind of indicator that there are potentially quite a number of issues that aren't being tracked properly.  And thanks for clarifying your position regarding the original sources of information. I hope that in the future there won't be any such cases where an id isn't assigned due to miscommunication.
