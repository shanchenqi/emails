Everyone being well intentioned here, the question is how to put forward  the least amount of effort (work) and get the most results (overall  security).  When that issue gets hazy, it's often useful to fall back  upon some fundamental tenets that we as computer guys usually believe  in.  "Openness" springs to mind at the moment, although other similarly  respected concepts might be equally applicable.  Not taking sides or anything; just suggesting that, all other things  being equal, the most philosophically appealing course might turn out to  be the best one.  Seems to work for physics.  :-)  Regards, Alton Moore    Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
