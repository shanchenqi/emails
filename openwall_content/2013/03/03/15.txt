Aren't these problems true for any source whether it be primary, secondary, tertiary, or so on?  > I will no longer be issuing CVE's for > issues brought up through the Debian bugtracker without an original > source to back it up, otherwise more mistakes will happen which is not > good.  I don't understand the purpose of excluding an entire project's sources.  Should redhat's bugzilla, gentoo, etc. also be excluded for the same reason?  If not, why do they get special treatment?  Is there really a problem at all?  The debian report included the upstream commit, so you had a link to a primary resource anyway.  So, I think a simple solution to this 'problem' of secondary sources is follow them to the primary one?
