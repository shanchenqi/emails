They disable entity expansion (which seems like a safe bet for OpenID based XML stuff).  Please use for this issue, specifically for XIE (XML Internal Entity expansion).  Just a note on XML External Entity (XXE) expansion in ruby-openid which uses rexml, according to:  https://pypi.python.org/pypi/defusedxml/0.3  Ruby's REXML document parser is vulnerable to entity expansion attacks (both quadratic and exponential) but it doesn't do external entity expansion by default. In order to counteract entity expansion you have to disable the feature:  REXML::Document.entity_expansion_limit = 0  libxml-ruby and hpricot don't expand entities in their default configuration. So in general the CVEs I'm assigning to ruby stuff will be for internal entity expansion and not for external entity expansion since a protective mechanism exists that the application can use.
