Note that I didn't want to request a CVE# for that, and used a somewhat low severify value for the report in the Debian BTS (which was quite some time after the initial report).  If I thought it deserves a CVE, I'd request one right after seeing the discussion in question :)  But I guess we're muddling waters for too much already.  I merely commented on the joke about Debian, -- the issue is definitely not debian-specific, Debian does not even use mdev from busybox (but allows to use it to the users).
