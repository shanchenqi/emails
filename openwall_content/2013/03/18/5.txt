This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier  Versions Affected:  All. Not affected:       None. Fixed Versions:      Impact ------ The sanitize helper in Ruby on Rails is designed to filter HTML and remove all tags and attributes which could be malicious.  The code which ensured that URLs only contain supported protocols contained several bugs which could allow an attacker to embed a tag containing a URL which executes arbitrary javascript code.  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the work arounds immediately.  Releases -------- The and releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds ----------- If you are unable to upgrade, you can place the following code into a file in config/initializers and it will replace the method with the correct implementation.    module HTML     class WhiteListSanitizer       self.protocol_separator =        def contains_bad_protocols?(attr_name, value)         uri_attributes.include?(attr_name) &&         (value =~ && !allowed_protocols.include?(value.split(protocol_separator).first.downcase.strip))       end     end   end    Patches ------- To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series.  They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.  * 3-2-sanitize_protocol.patch - Patch for 3.2 series * 3-1-sanitize_protocol.patch - Patch for 3.1 series * 3-0-sanitize_protocol.patch - Patch for 3.0 series * 2-3-sanitize_protocol.patch - Patch for 2.3 series  Please note that only the 3.1.x and 3.2.x series are supported at present.  Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.
