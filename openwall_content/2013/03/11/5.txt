[...]  While I'll be the first to agree that migrating to a more widely accepted modern hashing scheme is a noble goal, I'm unconvinced you present a security vulnerability in these tools' use of MD5.  1. Do the authors indicate in their documentation that this is intended to protect against malicious actors altering data in transit (a la MitM), and not just to identify corrupted downloads?  2. These tools are retrieving the checksums and files being checksummed from the same location in many (most?) cases, right?  3. Can you come up with a reasonable case in which a collision attack on MD5 would actually allow for maliciousness in this case (note most common scenarios would require a preimage or second preimage attack on MD5 instead, which still has yet to be demonstrated)? --  { PGP( ); FINGER( fungi@...ulhu.yuggoth.org ); WWW( http://fungi.yuggoth.org/ ); IRC( fungi@....yuggoth.org#ccl ); WHOIS( STANL3-ARIN ); MUD( ); }  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
