The above is Kurt's opinion, which he is indeed entitled to, but it is not a list moderators' statement.  Thus, please do not be significantly discouraged to discuss "the theoretical/philosophical nature of information security as applied to the Linux kernel" in here just because of Kurt's posting. :-)  Indeed, if that's the general feeling of list members, we may have to put an end to the discussion, but I am not seeing that yet.  In fact, I think the discussion will happily clam down on its own.  Discussions such as this one are in fact on-topic here, despite of them being relatively rare.  This is the right venue.  I do not think we need a separate venues for these things yet (if ever).
