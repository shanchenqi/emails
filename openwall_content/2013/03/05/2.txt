At this point I literally don't understand the conversation, it appears some people have theoretical concerns about openness/etc. but I'm not seeing anything remotely evidence based to support their positions. OTOH we have the kernel devs like Greg who are making arguments based on past behaviour/evidence of basically what works/what doesn't work. I should note that the standards and current processes have worked quite well AFAIK (I've only really been tracking Linux security closely for 14 years now, prior to summer of I can't really say).  If anyone has really evidence based problems/issues to bring up, please do so. Otherwise can we stop with all the hand waving, keep doing what we have been doing which seems to work quite well and let Greg/etc. get back to work?  If you want to discuss the theoretical/philosophical nature of information security as applied to the Linux kernel I'd be happy to set up a separate list for that, OSS-Security isn't really the right venue.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =ScBC -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
