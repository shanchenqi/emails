And with all due respect, it has happened before that you've asked for an "original source" (upstream commit or bug report) when there exists none. All it has lead is to the CVE request becoming stalled or even abandoned.  What can we do about it?  We already have a quite long list of issues without a CVE id and this is not good for anybody: https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/fake-names  (nb. some of the issues in the list might already have an id but the temporary entry hasn't been removed or it was decided that no id should be assigned)  Regards, --  Raphael Geissert - Debian Developer www.debian.org - get.debian.net  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
