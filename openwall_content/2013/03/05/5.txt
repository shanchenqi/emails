Coming up with a proper patch, testing it, packaging it and releasing it to users takes at least a week, and I personally think that's erring optimistically.  For parts of a system that really *can't* be disabled without making the system completely unusable (kernel, glibc and to some extent ssh tools), I think a longer shush-time than "time of commit" is suitable for full disclosure announcement. Note "announcement" here. People who're really interested can ofcourse see in the patch and commit-message how the bug can be triggered.  Otoh, where workarounds can be applied that prevent the bug from happening the issue, I believe protection information should be released immediately. Writing exploits (or test-cases) from workaround information is a *lot* harder than from full disclosure listings.  --  Andreas Ericsson                   andreas.ericsson@....se OP5 AB                             www.op5.se Tel: +46                  Fax: +46  Considering the successes of the wars on alcohol, poverty, drugs and terror, I think we should give some serious thought to declaring war on peace.
