When posting to oss-security, it's reasonable to say whether CVEs have already been requested or not.  There is not a well-established infrastructure or communication channel to closely coordinate CVE assignments between MITRE and Kurt.  - Steve   >-----Original Message----- >From: Reed Loden [mailto:reed@...dloden.com] >Sent: Wednesday, March 20, AM >To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com >Cc: kseifried@...hat.com; Henri Salo; larry0@...com; Christey, Steven M. >Subject: Re: [oss-security] Re: [Red Hat - Possible Forgery] Re: [oss-security] >Ruby CVEs > >-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- >Hash: SHA1 > >On Wed, 20 Mar >Kurt Seifried <kseifried@...hat.com> wrote: > >> Please don't send requests to oss-sec if you already sent a request to >> Mitre/anyone else.
