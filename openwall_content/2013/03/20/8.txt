Two callers of ext3_msg omit the prefix and pass the format string as the second parameter and the first parameter to the format string as the third parameter. In both cases this string comes from an arbitrary source.  An user able to mount ext3 filesystems could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, increase their privileges.
