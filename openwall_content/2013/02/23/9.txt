(Also done in light of the Linus Torvalds flame posting.)  PolicyKit rules in PackageKit also allow this in the vanilla version: 	org.freedesktop.packagekit.system-update shipping default is "yes" for local logged-in active users.   So far we assumed that the update operation only allows upgrading versions.  The enforcement of this rule did not fully work, so at least the "zypp" backend of PackageKit allowed downgrade of packages using this call. The "update" method also allowed installing non-update resolvables like patterns or even new packages.  We have not checked the other backends, they might also be affected.    As the default assumed secure behaviour is violated, this requires a CVE.
