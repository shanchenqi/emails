Therefore, > the vulnerability resides entirely in the code which uses expat.  Yes but I think it's common enough to warrant it (this is one of those cases where things don't map super cleanly):  Handling External Entity References  Expat does not read or parse external entities directly. Note that any external DTD is a special case of an external entity.  If you've set no <code>ExternalEntityRefHandler</code>, then external entity references are silently ignored. Otherwise, it calls your handler with the information needed to read and parse the external entity.  Your handler isn't actually responsible for parsing the entity, but it is responsible for creating a subsidiary parser with <code><a href= "#XML_ExternalEntityParserCreate" > XML_ExternalEntityParserCreate</a></code> that will do the job. > This returns an instance of <code>XML_Parser</code> that has handlers and other data structures initialized from the parent parser. You may then use <code><a href= "#XML_Parse" >XML_Parse</a></code> or <code><a href= "#XML_ParseBuffer">XML_ParseBuffer</a></code> calls against this parser.  Since external entities my refer to other external entities, your handler should be prepared to be called recursively.  Parsing DTDs  In order to parse parameter entities, before starting the parse, you must call <code><a href= "#XML_SetParamEntityParsing" > XML_SetParamEntityParsing</a></code> with one of the following arguments:   *<code>XML_PARAM_ENTITY_PARSING_NEVER</code> Don't parse parameter entities or the external subset   *<code>XML_PARAM_ENTITY_PARSING_UNLESS_STANDALONE</code> Parse parameter entites and the external subset unless <code>standalone</code> was set to "yes" in the XML declaration.   *<code>XML_PARAM_ENTITY_PARSING_ALWAYS</code> Always parse parameter entities and the external subset  In order to read an external DTD, you also have to set an external entity reference handler as described above.    - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =uJuT -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
