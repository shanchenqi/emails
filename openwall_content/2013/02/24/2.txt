Patch (already in net/master):  Affected versions: v3.3 - v3.8  PoC is not attached this time but can be requested on demand. Hint: Works well on Fedora 18, bypassing all mmap_min_addr checks. ;)   Thanks, Mathias  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
