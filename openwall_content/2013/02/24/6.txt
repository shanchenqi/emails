This goes back to the discussion regarding programs such as gpg. Personally I would rather see the log files (ALL log files for ALL programs actually) created using a default permission that is safe (e.g. or if it writes to it with the group permissions), but can be configured and easily overridden in a config file (e.g. nginx.conf) so that people that have a legitimate need for world readable log files can do so easily.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  Q4OBraQ+yCIzS3cGO+FA =EBGC -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
