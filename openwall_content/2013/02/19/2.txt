By using entities in XML requests, an unauthenticated attacker may consume excessive resources on the Keystone, Nova or Cinder API servers, resulting in a denial of service and potentially a crash Authenticated attackers may also leverage XML entities to read the content of a local file on the Keystone API server This only affects servers with XML support enabled.  Note: The vulnerabilities are actually in the various affected Python XML libraries, but we provide OpenStack patches working around the issues.
