The description will be updated to clarify this (see below). ====  As you can see from the advisories:  CVE:  They were correctly referenced in the OpenStack advisories, however the CVE's did get used elsewhere:       OpenStack Keystone     Cinder     Nova  So please REJECT and and use as appropriate instead to identify these issues.
