Keystone fails to check whether a user, tenant, or domain is enabled before authenticating a user using the EC2 api. Authenticated, but disabled users (or authenticated users in disabled tenants or domains) could therefore retain access rights that were thought removed. Only setups enabling EC2-style authentication are affected. To disable EC2-style authentication to work around the issue, remove the EC2 extension (keystone.contrib.ec2:Ec2Extension.factory) from the keystone API pipeline in keystone.conf.
