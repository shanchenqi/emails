Then there's the issue of "what is and is not a security fix", and that is a discussion that we aren't going to have here, sorry.  One problem is that there are very few things reported and fixed through security@.  Maybe one patch every other kernel release or so.  And some subsystems (i.e. networking) refuse to go through the security alias.  The _large_ majority of all fixes go through their individual subsystem development process, and those are the ones you should be searching through the commit logs for, as this patch itself proves.  thanks,  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
