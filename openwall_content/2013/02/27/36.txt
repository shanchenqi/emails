Perhaps the solution is changing the development model or architecture of the kernel such that there aren't so many bugs with *serious* impact in the first place.  Ooops... did I say that out loud?    Seriously though, when threads of disagreement erupt like this, often taking a step back to look at the root cause is a good approach.  tim  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
