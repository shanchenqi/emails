Yes, I need someone to actually do this.  There used to be a Red Hat security team member that did this, or so I thought.  What happened to that process?  I'll ask on security@...nel.org if someone wants to volunteer to do this, but if not, are you, or anyone else you know/trust willing to do so?  thanks,  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
