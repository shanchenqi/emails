Hi:  I recently downloaded and tried pigz - thanks for the software - its very useful for multicore systems, especially on the big iron that NERSC runs.  However, there seems to be a security hole, relating to permissions during compression.  The permissions of the .gz file being created are less restrictive than the original file, which is different than gzip, per the below:  using gzip:  # gzip -9 x & [1] # ls -l x* -rw-------. 1 root root Jul 26 x -rw-------. 1 root root   Jul 26 x.gz #   using pigz:  # pigz -9 x& [1] # ls -l x* -rw-------. 1 root root Jul 26 x -rw-r--r--. 1 root root   Jul 26 x.gz # pigz --version pigz #   the file contents are potentially exposed during compression due to permissions, which is a potential security hole....  Hope this helps,  Jim Mellander NERSC Cybersecurity  On Fri, Feb 15, at PM, Kurt Seifried <kseifried@...hat.com> wrote: > -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- > Hash: SHA1 > > On AM, Michael Tokarev wrote: >> I think this one well deserves a CVE#.
