I've been involved in oss-sec from the very start of it, and before that, I was on vendor-sec since or so.  > Anyway, on a more serious note, at some point, acceptance will look > something like a real kernel-sec team that does essentially what you > just did, but on a continual basis: reviewing most/all commits for > potential security concerns and forwarding them to oss-sec to increase > identification and awareness to be applied downstream.  I will say flat out that this is an impossible task to accomplish.  As proof of that, I suggest you do this for just one major kernel release cycle (2-3 months long).  You do know the number of patches applied to the Linux kernel every hour, right?  Would you have caught the patch that started this thread?  I sure didn't, and I was the one who originally applied it to the kernel tree in the first place.  Doing "root-cause" research for every patch is non-trivial, as I know you realize.  > Unfortunately a person/group needs to want to scratch that particular > itch, and more importantly be able to deal with leaders antipathetic > to their work.

What anger?  I push out on average, kernel bugfixes a week publicly for all to see, for multiple kernel versions.  Trying to do the categorization you wish for above for just that small number of patches is impossible to do, ask the people who have tried to do it.  I would be very happy to see just these bugfixes to be categorized, and if people wish to dig further into the patches I miss, I would be more than willing to take them into the stable kernel releases as well.  I gladly welcome any help in this area, and always have.  thanks,  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
