The linux-distros mailing list has strict rules about the maximum embargo period. It is ~14 days. I hope that ~14 days are acceptable as a grace period for you when the commit goes public. At the end of the embargo period the info is always sent to oss-sec with CVE id assigned.   Also, Alexander, are you willing to accept the semi-public nature of the sko submissions to linux-distros and treat them as embargoed even though the commit is already public?  For me, this solutions is not optimal as we usually treat any issue that has public commit as public one, but it would at least avoid like problems.
