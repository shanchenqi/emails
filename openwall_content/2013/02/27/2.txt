It is certainly not universal, and no software should assume that home directory permissions are structured that way when deciding on the permissions of other files created under the user's home directory.  Some of us who have been using UNIX for long enough that we originally learned the permissions system when sharing was emphasized over security do still use world-readable home directories, with specific directories under it restricted.  We would like software, when creating private files, to not assume that it can be careless about permissions of individual files because "of course" the user's home directory is private.  --  Russ Allbery (rra@...nford.edu)             <http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/>  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
