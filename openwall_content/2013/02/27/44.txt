And do you think it'd be possible to have the same kind of notifications for (know security) issues not on security@k.o but committed to the tree? As I understand it networking subsystem patches don't go through security@k.o so for example I guess the sock_diag_handlers[] one didn't go through security@k.o but was still identified (at least for some people) as a security commit?
