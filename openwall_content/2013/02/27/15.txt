Huh?!  Maybe you misread what Petr wrote?  Note: "when the patch is being committed".  At this point, the security issue is public, and it just needs to be properly communicated to all those interested (including distros, sysadmins, etc.), such as via oss-security.  Not doing this favors those few who spend time to review commits on their own; some of them do it for purposes other than informing the public.  We have a similar policy for the distros and linux-distros private lists.  When an issue initially brought up there is finally made public, it must be brought up on oss-security.  I must admit there were a few cases where we failed to do that, but they were just that - failures. I'd appreciate help of other distros/linux-distros list members to ensure that each and every issue is brought to oss-security when it is being made public (even if only via commits of the fixes).  Formally, this is responsibility of the original reporter:  http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros  "When the security issue is finally to be made public, it is your (the original reporter's) responsibility to post about it to oss-security (indeed, you and others may also post to any other mailing lists, etc.)"  but in practice the original reporter sometimes fails to do that, in which case the list members should remind the reporter and/or take care of bringing the issue to oss-security themselves.  I think security@...nel.org should adopt a similar policy, and someone on that list should be enforcing it.
