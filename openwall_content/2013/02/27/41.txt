I'd love it if it were this simple, but it's not.  It's work.  Look at the examples of good security reports on this list (e.g. ones that were issued CVEs with no extra discussion needed).  These reports require thoughtful analysis, testing, and a good sense of what the tradeoffs are for making the fixes.  this takes time (and skill).  Sometimes all the work and analysis leads to a conclusion that the failure was not actually exploitable in any significant way.  And not every fix has obvious security implications -- some only become apparent after the investigative work is done.  Some fixes are simple, fixing them has no obvious side effects, and there is clear evidence not fixing it could lead to an exploit.  You could even argue that the issue that started this thread is one of them (though i haven't spent enough time to understand it well enough to know if that's the case).  If *every* bug fix were reported to oss-security without this work, as something like "i'm not sure, but this might be security-related", then this list would drown in noise (the NYC MTA's supposed anti-terrorism campaign suffers this same flaw, btw).  So, we have a culture of asking people to report security flaws only after doing some level of work to ensure that the report is correct and understood.  We have to acknowledge that this is extra work, and not everyone has the time (or skill) to do it properly.  	--dkg   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
