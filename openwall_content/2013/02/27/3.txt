For years and years kernel developers have been stuck at the first stage of grieving (denial).  Thanks to recent public shaming, the second stage (anger) is seeming to set in, which at the very least is progress.  Personally, I'm hoping to see bargaining in fewer than the 20 years it took to get here.  There are five stages total, so if each takes as long as the first, there is the distinct possibility that we'll be waiting a century for a high-quality kernel security posture ;)  Anyway, on a more serious note, at some point, acceptance will look something like a real kernel-sec team that does essentially what you just did, but on a continual basis: reviewing most/all commits for potential security concerns and forwarding them to oss-sec to increase identification and awareness to be applied downstream.  Unfortunately a person/group needs to want to scratch that particular itch, and more importantly be able to deal with leaders antipathetic to their work. Also, as Kurt was alluding to, the rewards don't seem to be there, and of course there is a lot of potential for pain (i.e. dealing with the anger).
