Yes, some bugs are esoteric and it's not immediately obvious that they are security related. But there are so many bugs that are _clearly_ security-related. Kernel developers are super smart -- some of the brightest guys out there. When you're committing a fix for a use-after-free, or an array indexing error, or something clearly security-related, the claim, "well I'm not really a big security bug classifier sort of guy..." just doesn't ring honest. You all are super smart; it takes your brain less than a single cycle to realize this or that memory corruption can lead to priv escalation. I admit there are some bugs where it's not so obvious, but for so many cases, the classification step can be done by many diverse kernel devs.  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
