[ This is mostly directed to Red Hat at this point. We'll expand to the other recipients or vendors later. ]  We're not exactly sure that MITRE has the next step here. A CVE exists, that was issued by the Red Hat CNA. When the CVE assignment was made, presumably one or more persons at Red Hat had a working understanding of what the name means. (For example: was the CVE assigned with a multi-vendor scope in mind? Was the CVE assigned to cover the entirety of the content of the www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/TLStiming.pdf research paper?) MITRE would, in general, want to preserve this original meaning if it makes sense to do that. Because there's no specific statement on this list about what means, we'd next go to     to see if that may be a canonical statement of what means. But there's nothing there yet.  Before offering a guess from MITRE, we'll wait for some more information.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =a2X7 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
