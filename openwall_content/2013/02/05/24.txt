But what data should be used for that calculation? The TLS 1.1 and 1.2 RFCs recommend checking the MAC as if there was a zero-length pad."   "Opera were notified of our attacks in December Our attacks are addressed in Opera version released (see the advisory)   "The GnuTLS implementation of MEE-TLS-CBC deals with bad padding in a different way to that recommended in the RFCs: instead of assuming zero-length padding, it uses the last byte of plaintext to determine how many plaintext bytes to remove (whether or not those bytes are correctly formatted padding). ... This indicates that ignoring the recommendations of the RFCs can have severe security consequences."   "Network Security Services (NSS) ... the same approach as taken in GnuTLS"   "PolarSSL ... The code does not sanity check padlen before running the padding check, meaning that out-of-bounds comparisons may be made" (a possible denial-of-service issue for some applications)   "PolarSSL ... it does not perform any MAC check if this sanity check fails, but instead exits immediately. This would render the implementation vulnerable to a simple timing-based distinguishing attack." (requires a non-default configuration with "TLS alert messages when decryption errors are encountered")   "yaSSL ... CyaSSL code does not perform proper padding checks, but instead just examines the last byte of plaintext and uses this to determine how many bytes to remove."   "The Bouncy-Castle code does careful sanity checking of the padding length (as indicated by the last byte of plaintext) but treats the padding as having length 1 ... This deviates slightly from the recommendation of the RFCs to treat the padding as having length zero"    It is possible that MITRE will assign a CVE name for an F5 vulnerability later. (This is referenced by "F5 were notified of our attacks in December They have informed us that their TLS dataplane traffic is not vulnerable due to cryptographic offload, but that local management ports and virtual editions may be vulnerable. They also informed us that F5s hotfix for this issue will follow shortly after OpenSSL issues their patch." but that statement may mean that the issue existed in OpenSSL code that was shipped within F5 products.) Other CVEs related to other products are obviously also possible.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =+Wxi -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
