(Copy of previously sent advisory)  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1      Xen Security Advisory / XSA-39 			      version 2            Linux netback DoS via malicious guest ring.  UPDATES IN VERSION 2 ====================  Public release.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The Xen netback implementation contains a couple of flaws which can allow a guest to cause a DoS in the backend domain, potentially affecting other domains in the system.  is a failure to sanity check the ring producer/consumer pointers which can allow a guest to cause netback to loop for an extended period preventing other work from occurring.  is a memory leak on an error path which is guest triggerable.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest can mount a DoS affecting the entire system.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All systems running guests with access to PV network devices are vulnerable.  affects both mainline ("pvops") and classic-Xen patch kernels.  affects only mainline ("pvops") kernels.  MITIGATION ==========  Running HVM guests with only emulated or passthrough NICs or PV guests with only passthrough NICs will avoid this vulnerability.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patches in sequence resolves this issue.  xsa39-pvops-*.patch            Apply to mainline Linux xsa39-classic-*.patch          Apply to tree.  All patches for the given branch should be applied in numerical order.  $ xsa39*.patch       $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =UhBt -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
