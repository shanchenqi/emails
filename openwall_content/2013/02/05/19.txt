We did provide this CVE to the OpenSSL team (at the time the request was made we did not receive any disclosure on the issue and were not aware of other affected implementations).  The intention was then just for OpenSSL (perhaps under the assumption this was for an OpenSSL-specific issue, again, unaware of the details of the flaw).  If MITRE wants to use it as a general name for the other affected implementations (GnuTLS, NSS, etc.) as well, and not just OpenSSL, that's fine.  We have not allocated any CVEs for these other implementations, nor did we provide this CVE name to the authors of the paper.  The long and short of it is a private (unspecified) request came from the OpenSSL team and we provided it, so there was no specific intention on our part as to how the name was used or what it meant.  I hope that clarifies things a bit.  We have no particular preference either way, so we'll leave this to your discretion.
