UPDATES IN VERSION 2 ====================  Public release.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Xen's PCI backend drivers in Linux allow a guest with assigned PCI device(s) to cause a DoS through a flood of kernel messages, potentially affecting other domains in the system.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest can mount a DoS affecting the entire system.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All systems running guests with access to passed through PCI devices are vulnerable.  Both mainline ("pvops") and classic-Xen patch kernels are affected.  MITIGATION ==========  This issue can be avoided by not assigning PCI devices to untrusted guests.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.  xsa43-pvops.patch            Apply to mainline Linux xsa43-classic.patch          Apply to tree.  $ xsa43*.patch  xsa43-classic.patch  xsa43-pvops.patch $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =5o5U -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment "xsa43-classic.patch" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment "xsa43-pvops.patch" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
