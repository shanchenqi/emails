I also noticed that OpenSSL has a CVE for this (I'm assuming that the issue is _not_ the same thing, but that is this issue).  Since it's a weakness in TLS/DTLS itself, from my understanding, and not necessarily in a particular implementation, I'm not sure if this qualifies as one CVE for the weakness, or if it needs one per implementation.  MITRE, can someone provide some guidance on this?  --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
