The problem is in libutp code, and Transmission upstream seems to commit their own change only due to libutp (un)responsiveness: [6]  Thank you && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team  P.S.: All the links from above at one place are at:       [7]  ----- Original Message ----- On dim., at Josselin Mouette wrote: > Package: transmission-daemon > Version: > Severity: grave > Tags: security patch upstream > Justification: user security hole >  > The transmission-daemon package in wheezy crashes regularly.
