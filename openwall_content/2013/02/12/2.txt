Looks like we have previously investigated this issue with the following conclusion:  > /* Should one be also classified as (another) CVE id? */  It is my understanding that this bug will cause valid certificates to be rejected, but not for invalid certificates to be accepted. Therefore I do not think it qualifies for a CVE ID.  => not a security flaw. Ignore my previous request.  Thank you && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team  ----- Original Message ----- Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,    Originally, Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier to the following vulnerability:  Apache Commons HttpClient 3.x, as used in Amazon Flexible Payments Service (FPS) merchant Java SDK and other products, does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.  Later it was found, that the SSL hostname verifier implementation fix) contained a bug in wildcard matching: [1]  which still allowed certain type of certificates checks to pass, even if they shouldn't.  Relevant upstream patches: [2]     (against 4.2.x branch) [3]     (against trunk)  References: [4] [5]  Could you allocate a CVE id for this?
