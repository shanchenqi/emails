For distro vendor kernels (rather than mainline, which was patched almost a month ago), this is a 0-day.  We need to figure out a few things:  What's the oldest affected kernel version?  Which "stable" and distro vendor kernels are affected?  This does not appear to be e.g. on Red Hat's Bugzilla yet ... but it's already on HN:   (perhaps the weekend plays a role in the delay of vendor response).  Are all architectures affected?  The ptrace code in the kernel is naturally somewhat arch-specific, so _maybe_ not all are affected.  The mainline commits from January are by Oleg Nesterov of Red Hat.  Why wasn't(?) the issue handled with due severity within Red Hat, then - such that Red Hat would at the very least have a statement on whether and which of their kernels are affected by now.  My guess is that the full severity of the issue might not have been understood by Oleg at the time, but it's only a guess.
