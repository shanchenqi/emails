No I didn't. This is why I require good quality requests, anything else is a waste of my time. If it doesn't meet an easy "definitely a security bug" I push it back to people and keep poking them with annoying questions, in some cases this takes weeks or months to be resolved (some are quite subtle, like that IPv6 Kernel stuff).  I assigned CVEs last year, it will be more this year. At one hour per CVE that would be a full years work right there. Even at 1-5 minutes per CVE it's still a huge time sink. The Kernel people are working with roughly an order or two magnitude more bug reports to assess (because even trivial looking things can turn out to have nasty consequences or even represent entirely new classes of flaws, just look at the recent Ruby stuff or XML stuff).  >> Nope, we are dumb, we do uninteresting, boring work, dealing with >> broken hardware and demanding users every day.

If we had any sense we'd go live in the woods in a cabin and drink moonshine and go hunting. I'm still assigning CVE's for /tmp file vulns. That's just inexcusably stupid.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =H3sd -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
