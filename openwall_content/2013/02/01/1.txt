Previously the HMAC key was not initialized properly, which allowed certain packets to pass through to the internal phases of the Corosync packet validation process, possibly leading to corosync daemon crash.  References: [1] [2] [3] [4]  The HMAC initialization has been corrected in upstream via: [5]  but there might be more changes needed (Cc-in Fabio and Jan).  Could you allocate a CVE id for this?
