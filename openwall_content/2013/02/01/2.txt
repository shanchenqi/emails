Also, the DoS reason is not correct. The junk filter part is a consequence on how libnss work and should be dropped.  Subject should be:  "CVE Request -- Corosync (2.0 <= X < 2.3): Remote DoS due improper HMAC initialization"  >  > A denial of service flaw was found in the way Corosync, > the cluster engine and application programming interfaces, > performed processing of certain network packets, when different > encryption keys were used.

I explained this in details and this description is not accurate.  "A remote denial of service flaw was found in the way Corosync, the cluster engine and application programming interfaces, performed processing of network packets. Previously the HMAC key was not initialized properly, which allowed random targeted packets to be processed by the internal process of corosync and possibly leading to a daemon crash".  >  > The HMAC initialization has been corrected in upstream via: > [5] >  > but there might be more changes needed (Cc-in Fabio and Jan).  2 missing:   Thanks Fabio  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
