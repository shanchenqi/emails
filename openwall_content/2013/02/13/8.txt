(Ralf) [3] >  rsc@...tux.com  [A] Doesn't have security implications if roundup is correnctly configured. The bug would create a python backtrace. Unless the "debug" option in section [web] is set (which is explicitly discouraged) this will only display "an error has occurred" in the web-interface. Even if someone sets the debug option in a production release only the hashed password could be disclosed. Note that this bug only affects the anydbm backend which should not be used for a production version either.   > [B] * Fix XSS vulnerability when username contains > HTML code, thanks to Thomas Arendsen Hein for reporting and patch. > (Ralf) [4]  Please use for this issue  > [C] * Fix XSS vulnerability in @action parameter,  > thanks to "om" for reporting.

(Ralf)  rsc@...tux.com  [D] No security implications: Fixed some permissions on files in roundup/cgi and locale directories. These are not accessible via the web-server. So this doesn't constitute a remote vulnerability. Local users don't gain anything executing these files as no privilege escalation is involved (they could copy the file which is readable anyway and make their local copy executable).  > [E] * Fix another XSS with the "otk" parameter, thanks to Jesse > Ruderman for reporting.
