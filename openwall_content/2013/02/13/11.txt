Researchers in general should remain aware that bugs in security features do not necessarily constitute vulnerabilities.  And, as already implied in this thread - if functionality is broken but there is no attacker role, or if the affected software is effectively placed into a more restricted "security policy" than intended, then this behavior would be treated as a bug (or feature), not a vulnerability, so it would not receive a CVE.  - Steve    -----Original Message----- From: Kurt Seifried [mailto:kseifried@...hat.com]  Sent: Tuesday, February 12, PM To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Cc: David Jorm; Christey, Steven M.
