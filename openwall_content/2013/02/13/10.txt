UPDATES IN VERSION 2 ====================  Public release.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Linux kernel when returning from an iret assumes that %ds segment is safe and uses it to reference various per-cpu related fields. Unfortunately the user can modify the LDT and provide a NULL one. Whenever an iret is called we end up in xen_iret and try to use the %ds segment and cause an general protection fault.  IMPACT ======  Malicious or buggy unprivileged user space can cause the guest kernel to crash, or permit a privilege escalation within the guest, or operate erroneously.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All 32bit PVOPS versions of Linux are affected, since the introduction of Xen PVOPS support in  Classic-Xen kernels are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  This can be mitigated by not running 32bit PVOPS Linux guests.  32bit classic-Xen guests, all 64bit PV guests and all HVM guests are unaffected.   RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.   $ xsa42*.patch  $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =mgHb -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
