Ok, how could the Linux maintainers have done anything about this, when the developers involved in creating this patch didn't even realize it was a "security" issue in the first place?  I'm tired of people complaining about how the Linux kernel developers handle security issues, when no one seems to have a suggestion as to how anything could actually be done better.  And note, I was one of the people involved in this patch, and I didn't notice anything special about it, so if you want to blame anyone, blame me for not tagging it for inclusion in the stable kernel releases.  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
