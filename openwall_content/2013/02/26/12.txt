Why should they be paid? I'd say problem is that there isn't lots of people who understand aspects needed to notice a security vulnerability in Linux kernel and it's even more difficult to fix it without breaking something else.  Money is not the only thing getting stuff done.  -- Henri Salo  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
