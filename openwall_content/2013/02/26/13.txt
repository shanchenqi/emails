That tends to fall outside of what most people like to do as a hobby. Plus the volume needed, I think you underestimate how long code reviews take especially with the volume the Linux Kernel deals with. Hence the need to pay people so when they spend hours a week doing this they can also afford food and whatnot.  I've seen various attempts at crowd sourcing security, it doesn't work so well for the simple fact that most security people are very busy, and anyone that shows talent/good work ethic tends to get hired by a company and get even more busy.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =PFow -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
