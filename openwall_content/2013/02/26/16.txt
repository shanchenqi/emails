It appears my ~/.cache and your ~/.cache are mode Directories underneath are already unaccessible by other users, except if one of your programs passes a filedescriptor to a directory to another user's process (say, cwd is in ~/.cache/psi+ and then executes a setuid program, or uses unix(7) SCM_RIGHTS to pass a directory file descriptor to another program).  Are there environments where ~/.cache isn't by default?
