I will *privately* send you the draft that I'm working on right now.  Sorry to the rest of the list - but the combination of new vuln types, "DoS" debates, libraries, and missing details have all combined to make this rather complicated.  We will post something that should help address these specific situations, and others in the foreseeable future.  I hope to do this within 24 hours.  - Steve   -----Original Message----- From: Kurt Seifried [mailto:kseifried@...hat.com]  Sent: Wednesday, February 20, PM To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Cc: Christey, Steven M.

I'm now sitting on a huge pile of stuff that will need CVEs.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =uieQ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
