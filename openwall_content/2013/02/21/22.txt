While this is arguably "configuration," in products are expected to have other mechanisms of securing themselves out of the box, such as forcing a credentials change during installation, plus there is usually a race condition between when the product is installed and when the administrator changes the credentials.  - Steve   -----Original Message----- From: Kurt Seifried [mailto:kseifried@...hat.com]  Sent: Thursday, February 21, PM To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Cc: security curmudgeon Subject: Re: [oss-security] Two more ZoneMinder that need CVE  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1  On PM, security curmudgeon wrote: >  > re: Kurt's response about ZoneMinder:  > >  > OSVDB has two more ZoneMinder issues that do not have CVE: >  >          ZoneMinder index.php view Parameter > Traversal Local File Inclusion  I think this is the CVE I Just assigned.  >          ZoneMinder Multiple Default Credentials  By default, ZoneMinder installs with default user credentials (username/password combination). The 'zmuser' account has a password of 'zmpass' and the 'admin' account has a password of 'admin', both of which are publicly known and documented. This allows remote attackers to trivially access the program or system and gain privileged access.  so it doesn't qualify for a CVE.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =yYZ4 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
