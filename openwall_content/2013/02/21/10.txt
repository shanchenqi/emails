A quick look at the patch shows that the change here breaks the preg_replace call:  - $query_string = preg_replace("/(&trendhistory=)(\d+)/", "", $query_string); + $query_string = preg_replace("/(&trendhistory=)(\d+)/", "", htmlspecialchars($query_string, ENT_QUOTES) );  It looks as if the htmlspecialchars call was misplaced.  Not that it is a security issue, but it's a bug.  Can anyone forward this upstream? I will try to take a look at the rest of the patch later.
