To declare, I put forwards a candiate on another language platform to Kurt and  Steve which would be affected by a decision to assign CVEs for XXE capable  libraries.  In this instance, the library has no way to disable XXE at the API  level.  Below the surface it can use various XML parsers, both native and pure  $language.  These do not appear to support disabling resolving entities either  (although the middleware between the two does :/).  I'm am pinging the  security team responsible and directing them to this thread.
