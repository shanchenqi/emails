POsting stuff to a forum is not exactly the easiest place to find things, can they setup like zoneminder.com/security/ and at least list all the security issues and link to them there so people don't have to dig through the forums?  I say this because this is the first cve request I've ever seen for zoneminder since I started assigning, and indeed, since so I'm guessing there's a few more missing ones......  If someone wants to big through the forums to find them and post them here that would probably be helpful (seriously, wanna pad your resume and get a reference from me? first person to make good CVE requests wins).  > where zoneminder is prone to a local file inclusion vulnerability.  > From upstream versions prior to are affected and the issue > was fixed in and >  > SVN commits fixing this issue for the versions are > and and patches: >  > http://www.zoneminder.com/downloads/lfi-patch.txt  > http://www.zoneminder.com/downloads/lfi-patch2.txt >  > I haven't found a CVE assigned to this already.
