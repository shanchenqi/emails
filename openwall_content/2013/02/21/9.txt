I further know about the wikipage with the ChangeLog, but there is no patch referenced (thus the forum post). It's here:   [1] http://www.zoneminder.com/wiki/index.php/Change_History  But I have not read trough yet, to see if there are more changes indicating some security implication. For the one of my request there was only  FIX - Fixed Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability. Please note a patch for this is also available for which the tarball also contains for recent downloads.  > If someone wants to big through the forums to find them and post them > here that would probably be helpful (seriously, wanna pad your resume > and get a reference from me? first person to make good CVE > requests wins).  I can check indeed if I find more. The the forum post for there is still no answer from upstream[2]   [2]:  Regards, Salvatore  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
