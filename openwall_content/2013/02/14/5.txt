This issue would let an user to obtain information about paths he/she is not supposed to know in the server. This does not depend on php's display_errors being set to ON, as the information is disclosed by a xml/json that is generated by the plugin code.  PoC:  http://wordpress.gilgalab.com.br/?callback=json&api_key=true&format=json&method=gallery&id=1  http://wordpress.gilgalab.com.br/?callback=json&api_key=true&format=xml&method=recent&limit=1  Plugin page at wordpress: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/nextgen-gallery/  I have informed the wordpress team on this issue on February 8th, but no response has been given about it.
