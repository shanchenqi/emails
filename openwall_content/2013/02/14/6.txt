In general Pacemaker used a blocking socket (without a timeout) to wait for authentication credentials to arrive. When Pacemaker was configured to allow remote Cluster Information Base (CIB) cluster's configuration / cluster's resources management, a remote attacker could use this flaw to cause Pacemaker to block indefinitely (preventing it from serving another requests).  * The CVE identifier of has been assigned to this issue.  * This issue was found by David Vossel of Red Hat.  * Relevant upstream patch: [1]  * References: [2]  Thank you && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
