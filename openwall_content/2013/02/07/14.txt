We anticipate that several more vendors will release changelogs, with various levels of detail, mapping to that paper:   -- If the changelog simply reports a new release to address that     paper's issue, MITRE will consider that changelog to be a     reference. A new CVE will not be created for that     single vendor or a single product.   -- If the vendor states that it uses a codebase corresponding to     one of the other     CVEs (aka     side issues), then the changelog will become a reference for     that CVE.   -- If the vendor makes any other statement about a vulnerability     fix for a side issue, a new CVE will be created for the new side     issue.  This approach should enable MITRE to provide reasonably consistent CVE abstraction without detailed study of each vendor's code.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =LRzJ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
