(If the RADIUS feature was introduced in different versions than the authenticator-password feature, then maybe the SPLIT is acceptable.)  I'm not sure.  I didn't go digging to see when they were introduced -- both features may have been introduced at the same time (or not).  Ok, so doing a quick peek at the first full blob of it in git:   The use of random.randrange() is in both the CreateAuthenticator() and CreateID() functions, so I would bet that they've been like that the whole time (that blob is from Sept  So I guess one CVE is probably sufficient.  I only noted them as two issues as we had two separate bug reports about them.  >-----Original Message----- >From: Kurt Seifried [mailto:kseifried@...hat.com] >Sent: Friday, February 15, PM >To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com >Cc: Vincent Danen >Subject: Re: [oss-security] CVE request: python-pyrad insecurities > >-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- >Hash: SHA1 > >On AM, Vincent Danen wrote: >> Could a CVE be assigned to the following two issues please? >> >> #1: >> >> Nathaniel McCallum of Red Hat reported that pyrad was using >> Python's random module in a number of places to generate >> pseudo-random data.
