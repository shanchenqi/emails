In the case of the authenticator data, it was being used to secure a password sent over the wire.  Because Python's random module is not really suited for this purpose (not random enough), it could lead to password hashing that may be predictable.  #2:  Nathaniel McCallum of Red Hat reported that pyrad was creating serialized RADIUS packet IDs in the CreateID() function in packet.py. This is not suitable for RADIUS as the RFC specifies that the ID must not be predictable.  As a result, the ID of the next packet sent can be spoofed.   These have been corrected in upstream's forthcoming version 2.1 via:   --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
