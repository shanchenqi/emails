Do you happen to know of distro backports of the affected code to older kernels?  When you wrote that the bug is "in there for ages", did you mean that 3.3 has been out "for ages" or something else?  > PoC is not attached this time but can be requested on demand.

PoC here:   Apparently, high values of mmap_min_addr (like happen to work against this one, but they might not work against other attack vectors or/and kernel builds.  The bug is not a NULL+offset dereference, so mmap_min_addr was not supposed to help against its exploitation - it just happens to, sometimes.
