I see it in both and 3.3.  I did > not look back further.   The commit message goes on with details on how to trigger it. Note that as of [2], you can now mount filesystems as an unprivileged user after a call to unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER | CLONE_NEWNS), or a similar clone(2) call. This means all those random random filesystem bugs you have laying around in the junk bin are now quite useful. ++tricks;  Cheers, Jason   [1] [2]  -- Jason A.
