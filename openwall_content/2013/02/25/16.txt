I hope you don't mind. :-)  Personally, I don't care about this specific bug much (not relevant), but I do care about handling of Linux kernel bugs in general.  While we're at it, I notice that lately many of us use "kernel" in the Subject to refer to the Linux kernel.  I wonder if this little detail makes this mailing list a little less comfortable for non-Linux folks. Maybe we should put "Linux" or "Linux kernel" into the Subject on those occasions, not to discourage non-Linux discussions in here.  > There is no sock_diag > anywhere in the kernel; there is only inet_diag.
