(The difference may be whether Ubuntu is affected.)  Did you even try to run the exploit on a v3.2 kernel? Or even more simple, looked at the code of a v3.2 kernel? There is no sock_diag anywhere in the kernel; there is only inet_diag. And inet_diag hadn't and still does not have the out-of-bounds access issue. So no, this bug is non-existent on a v3.2 kernel.
