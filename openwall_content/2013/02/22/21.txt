Yeah, I believe so.  Last I looked, I came up with recommendations for folks to use xmlCtxtUseOptions with XML_PARSE_NOENT, XML_PARSE_NONET, and XML_PARSE_DTDLOAD set appropriately.  However, it wasn't clear to me at the time if these addressed all edge cases.  In particular, I didn't care much about the DoS cases at the time, but hopefully if DTDs are ignored, then it wouldn't be an issue.    I'd love to hear from an expert on this matter.  For sure the documentation needs to be improved...   >  > Please use for expat external entities expansion >  > I don't think expat resolves external entities at all.  Therefore, the > vulnerability resides entirely in the code which uses expat.  Last I checked, I came to the same conclusion.   tim  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
