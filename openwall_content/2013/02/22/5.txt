Michael Scherer (mscherer@...hat.com) of Red Hat found:  Looking for incorrect /tmp/ usage, I found the following piece of code in (https://rubygems.org/gems/ruby_parser)    def diff_pp o1, o2     require 'pp'      File.open("/tmp/a.#{$$}", "w") do |f|       PP.pp o1, f     end      File.open("/tmp/b.#{$$}", "w") do |f|       PP.pp o2, f     end      `diff -u /tmp/a.#{$$} /tmp/b.#{$$}`   ensure     File.unlink "/tmp/a.#{$$}" rescue nil     File.unlink "/tmp/b.#{$$}" rescue nil   end  This was assigned The current version of ruby_parser is and is affected. Fixing this is simple:  diff --git a/lib/gauntlet_rubyparser.rb b/lib/gauntlet_rubyparser.rb index - --- a/lib/gauntlet_rubyparser.rb +++ b/lib/gauntlet_rubyparser.rb @@ @@ class RubyParserGauntlet < Gauntlet    def diff_pp o1, o2      require 'pp'  - -    File.open("/tmp/a.#{$$}", "w") do |f| - -      PP.pp o1, f - -    end +    file_a = Tempfile.new('ruby_parser_a') +    PP.pp o1, file_a +    file_a.close + +    file_b = Tempfile.new('ruby_parser_b') +    PP.pp o2, file_b +    file_b.close  - -    File.open("/tmp/b.#{$$}", "w") do |f| - -      PP.pp o2, f - -    end  - -    `diff -u /tmp/a.#{$$} /tmp/b.#{$$}` +    `diff -u #{file_a.path} #{file_b.path}`    ensure - -    File.unlink "/tmp/a.#{$$}" rescue nil - -    File.unlink "/tmp/b.#{$$}" rescue nil +    file_a.unlink +    file_b.unlink    end  CC'ing the 3 people listed on ruby_parser as "owners".  Also I will be auditing a number of rubygems for various easy things, as a reminder tmp file vulns are EASY to fix, just use the functions listed in:   =============================== Public Service Announcement ===============================  For public issues please start CC'ing oss-security@ (especially if it needs a CVE), and also rubysec@...glegroups.com which will notify the Ruby Security people (and then cool things like their tools will warn users of outdated/insecure versions and so on).  For private/embargoed issues the rubygems.org/community is considering some ways to make it easier to report security issues in gems, we'll keep you posted.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =FAr9 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
