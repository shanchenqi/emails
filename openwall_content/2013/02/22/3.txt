Both are affected by the expansion of internal entities (which can be used to consume resources) and external entities (which can cause a denial of service against other services, be used to port scan, etc.).  To be clear:  ==================== Internal entity expansion refers to the exponential/quadratic/fast linear expansion of XML entities, e.g.: ==================== <!DOCTYPE xmlbomb [ <!ENTITY a > <!ENTITY b "&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;"> <!ENTITY c "&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;"> <!ENTITY d "&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;"> ]> <bomb>&d;</bomb>  or  <!DOCTYPE bomb [ <!ENTITY a "xxxxxxx... a couple of ten thousand chars"> ]> <bomb>&a;&a;&a;... repeat</bomb>  Which causes resources to be consumed    ==================== External entity expansion refers to the loading of external resources such as XML entities from another server or a local file: ==================== <!DOCTYPE external [ <!ENTITY ee SYSTEM "http://www.example.org/some.xml"> ]> <root>&ee;</root>   <!DOCTYPE external [ <!ENTITY ee SYSTEM "file:///PATH/TO/simple.xml"> ]> <root>&ee;</root>  Which can cause resources to be consumed or can result in port scanning /application scanning information being sent to the attacker.   So the CVE's to use:  Please use for libxml2 internal entity expansion  Please use for libxml2 external entities expansion  Please use for expat internal entity expansion  Please use for expat external entities expansion   If you know of other XML libraries that are vulnerable (and open source =) please let oss-sec know so we can assign CVEs.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =3XLg -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
