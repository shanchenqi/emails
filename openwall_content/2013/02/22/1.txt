Also Fedora 16 (and I assume are affected by this:  # ls -la /var/log/nginx/ total 8 drwxr-xr-x.  2 root root Feb 21 . drwxr-xr-x. 28 root root Feb 21 .. - -rw-r--r--.  1 root root    0 Feb 21 access.log - -rw-r--r--.  1 root root    0 Feb 21 error.log  Sigh.

Anyone care to make such a list and send it in?  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =2HIG -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
