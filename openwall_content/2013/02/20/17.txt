Well sure, some minority of apps will break.  Libraries release notes merely need to say "next version breaks backward compatibility for apps that use entities and inline DTDs.  If your app uses these, explicitly enable with ..."

Yes, but this is by far the least interesting attack scenario for most XML libraries.  Since libxml2 is pretty limited in it's entities support and network capabilities to begin with, it isn't as interesting of a case for XXE generally.  However, other libraries leverage many platform network capabilities that make for some much more interesting attacks.   tim  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
