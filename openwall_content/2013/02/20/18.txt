Once again, "off by > default", not removed.  Yeah I'm pretty sure that's a less than ideal solution. Less ideal in the sense of "breaking a whole bunch of customer software without much warning, some of which is probably closed source and can't be modified so that it works with these new "improved" xml libraries" is not the way to go. So that's not gonna happen for most major Linux vendors (in other words we'll have to find better ways to fix this).  Like Linus says, we can't just start breaking things.
