It was reported that Nagios at least, and possibly earlier versions, would allow users with access to Nagios to obtain full access to the servicegroup overview, even if they are not authorized to view all of the systems (not configured for this ability in the authorized_for_* configuration option).  This includes the servicegroup overview, summary, and grid.  Provided the user has access to view some services, they will be able to see all services (including those they should not see).  Note that the user in question must have access to some services and must have access to Nagios to begin with.  This has not yet been corrected upstream.
