Credits section added.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The patch making error handling paths preemptible broke page reference counting by not retaining a reference on pages stored for deferred cleanup. This would lead to the hypervisor prematurely attempting to free the page, generally crashing upon finding the page still in use.  CREDITS =======  Thanks to Andrew Cooper and the Citrix XenServer team for discovering and reporting this vulnerability, and helping investigate it.  IMPACT ======  Malicious or buggy PV guest kernels can mount a denial of service attack affecting the whole system. It can't be excluded that this could also be exploited to mount a privilege escalation attack.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen versions having the fixes applied are vulnerable.  The vulnerability is only exposed by PV guests.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only HVM guests, or PV guests with trusted kernels, will avoid this vulnerability.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.
