Our partner Intel thinks that these 3 are security relevant, so we think they also need seperate CVEs.  I only glanced what the issue is, please correct if my classification is wrong..  1. Info leak (?) via PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_KERNEL   commit Author: Peter Zijlstra <a.p.zijlstra@...llo.nl> Date:   Fri May 3      perf/x86/intel/lbr: Demand proper privileges for PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_KERNEL      We should always have proper privileges when requesting kernel     data.

Denial of service (system crash)   commit Author: Stephane Eranian <eranian@...gle.com> Date:   Tue Apr 16      perf/x86: Fix offcore_rsp valid mask for SNB/IVB          The valid mask for both offcore_response_0 and     offcore_response_1 was wrong for SNB/SNB-EP,     IVB/IVB-EP. It was possible to write to     reserved bit and cause a GP fault crashing     the kernel.          This patch fixes the problem by correctly marking the     reserved bits in the valid mask for all the processors     mentioned above.          A distinction between desktop and server parts is introduced     because bits are only available on the server parts.          This version of the  patch is just a rebase to perf/urgent tree     and should apply to older kernels as well.

Information leak (??) via perf LBR filter    commit Author: Peter Zijlstra <a.p.zijlstra@...llo.nl> Date:   Fri May 3      perf/x86/intel/lbr: Fix LBR filter          The LBR 'from' adddress is under full userspace control; ensure     we validate it before reading from it.          Note: is_module_text_address() can potentially be quite     expensive; for those running into that with high overhead     in modules optimize it using an RCU backed rb-tree.
