Please use for this issue.    It is possible to bypass Login Security features when soft blocking is disabled. This is due to the incorrect use of string filtering in the module which can cause the module to skip all checks.  Please use for this issue.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =aIiU -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
