A transient empty association is created while processing the duplicate cookie chunk that userspace could query, potentially leading to NULL pointer dereference. A remote attacker able to initiate SCTP connection to the system could use this flaw to create transient conditions that could lead to remote system crash if remote system user is querying SCTP connection info at the time these conditions exist.  Upstream fix: (already in stable)  References:  Thanks, --  Petr Matousek / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
