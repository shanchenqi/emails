Author: Emese Revfy <re.emese@...il.com> Date:   Wed Apr 17      kernel/signal.c: stop info leak via the tkill and the tgkill syscalls      This fixes a kernel memory contents leak via the tkill and tgkill syscalls     for compat processes.      This is visible in the siginfo_t->_sifields._rt.si_sigval.sival_ptr field     when handling signals delivered from tkill.      The place of the infoleak:      int copy_siginfo_to_user32(compat_siginfo_t __user *to, siginfo_t *from)     {             ...             put_user_ex(ptr_to_compat(from->si_ptr), &to->si_ptr);             ...     }      Signed-off-by: Emese Revfy <re.emese@...il.com>     Reviewed-by: PaX Team <pageexec@...email.hu>     Signed-off-by: Kees Cook <keescook@...omium.org>     Cc: Al Viro <viro@...iv.linux.org.uk>     Cc: Oleg Nesterov <oleg@...hat.com>     Cc: "Eric W.
