With this patch, we get the following correct behavior:    # echo 2 >/proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid     $ perf record -j any,k noploop 1   Error:   You may not have permission to collect stats.   Consider tweaking /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid:    -1 - Not paranoid at all     0 - Disallow raw tracepoint access for unpriv     1 - Disallow cpu events for unpriv     2 - Disallow kernel profiling for unpriv     $ perf record -j any,hv noploop 1    Error:    You may not have permission to collect stats.    Consider tweaking /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid:     -1 - Not paranoid at all      0 - Disallow raw tracepoint access for unpriv      1 - Disallow cpu events for unpriv      2 - Disallow kernel profiling for unpriv  Signed-off-by: Stephane Eranian <eranian@...gle.com> --- diff --git a/kernel/events/core.c b/kernel/events/core.c index --- a/kernel/events/core.c +++ b/kernel/events/core.c @@ @@ static int perf_copy_attr(struct perf_event_attr __user *uattr,  			 */  			attr->branch_sample_type = mask;  		} -		/* kernel level capture: check permissions */ -		if ((mask & PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_KERNEL) +		/* privileged levels capture (kernel, hv): check permissions */ +		if ((mask & PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_PERM_PLM)  		    && perf_paranoid_kernel() && !capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN))  			return -EACCES;  	}  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
