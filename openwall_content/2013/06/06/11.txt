We can handle nobody well enough by correcting its mis-use every time we spot it. There are enough purpose-specific users on a typical system these days to just give the impression that any new service should get its own corresponding user, so the temptation to use 'nobody' is lower than it used to be.  Of course, if a different user account gets abused for both chrooted and non-chrooted use, that's harder to combat, short of reminding people that chroot is filesystem and _only_ filesystem..
