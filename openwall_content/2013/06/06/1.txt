There's an argument to be made for removing the at-least-one rule, but if the system that password is being used with has those rules, it doesn't fix the problem anyway.  Perhaps a separate flag for that?  The changes are:  - Print a message and abort() of there's trouble opening or reading /dev/urandom (So apport should pick up any packages that have been using insecure entropy) - Make "-s" the default - Add an argument --insecure-phonemes (or -P) - Non-tty passwords are now as secure as tty - Require lower-case characters be present to even out some bias - Pull in passwdqc as a Suggests on the debian package - pwqgen can generate sane random passphrases  I can't imagine any reasonable use-case for the non-tty defaults (except maybe combining with espeak as an enhanced interrogation technique), and you can be certain that there's some people out there with it embedded in a script that's generating useless passwords.  For phonemes mode in general, the bias is extreme, there are a limited number of possible combinations and it is generally not suitable for security purposes.  I have some fairly detailed analysis of it, but I believe this list has a no-exploits policy...
