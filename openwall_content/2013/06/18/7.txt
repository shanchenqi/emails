It does not appear to be a once-in-a-blue-moon bug.  I think this needs to be tracked as a security bug because screen  locking is a security feature (which is part of many security policies).  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
