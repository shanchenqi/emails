In this case the repository key is the former maintainer's personal PGP key, which it appears he uses to sign deb-multimedia.org (the same set of packages as the former debian-multimedia.org). I would assume that it is unlikely to be held on a HSM, but I don't see any reason why it would now be less safe than it was while debian-multimedia.org was active.  Anyone who doesn't/didn't trust the maintainer of that repository (and in particular, anyone who doesn't/didn't trust him to store keys securely) shouldn't have added that repository's key as "trusted" in the first place.
