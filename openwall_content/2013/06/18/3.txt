I'm not completely sure what assigning a CVE would give here. Debian itself never shipped a package adding this apt source. Some people might have shipped some external packages adding it, but I'm not really aware of this. Usually the source was added manually by end-users.  So I'm not too sure what tracking the âissueâ would actually give. Maybe it can help raise awareness on this, but I'm not too convinced.
