To me, it's a big grey area as far as assigning a CVE for stuff like this.  But there's no reason we shouldn't raise awareness through venues like the various CERTs.  Though it seems US-CERT is only really good at re-sending microsoft and apple advisories these days. =(  tim  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
