However in this case would it be possible for the attacker to trigger a DoS that is difficult (if not impossible) to trace back to the attacker? In this case it might qualify for a CVE, but I'd also want to get Steven's thoughts (cc'ed directly).   - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  ztTTYMAgzWYPp3D9KUAu =YKK0 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
