So with the signing key requirement in mind this is not a vuln.  However my original question still stands, can/should we consider a common configuration of software that goes from being secure to insecure to be worthy of a CVE? A lot of things that used to be common practice (like shipping every service/server enabled, all accounts active, all access enabled, anonymous uploads allowed, etc.) are now seen as security vulnerabilities/exposures.  As for the security of the repo key proving that it it is safe/not compromised would be hard, I'm guessing it wasn't held on an HSM, and was it securely destroyed, or?  Also part of my thought process is that (for example) this would be a good configuration to check for and ensure is disabled, something for SCAP for example or the Debian security guide (e.g. a generic "make sure all enabled repos are actually working as expected").   - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =ZYhI -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
