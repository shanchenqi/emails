This is not an insecure configuration: This was never a Debian  service and people are free to put whatever they want in /etc/apt/sources.list.  There are hundreds of external apt sources and everyone of them could have their owner changed at some point.  Also there's no security issue: If a domain is grabbed and someone configures an apt repository on the site, he/she would lack the repository key previously used to sign the repo.
