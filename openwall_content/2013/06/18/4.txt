It's possibly worth noting that the repository that was at that site was signed and had been for some years, and the key was not compromised.  So not only would the site need to be taken over by an attacker for a successful exploit, but the affected user would have to ignore the copius warnings that APT produces when installing packages from an untrusted archive, or have configured APT to not check repository signatures.  --  Russ Allbery (rra@...nford.edu)             <http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/>  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
