This vulnerability can be exploited by a local user to crash system services that use libdbus, causing denial of service. It is platform-specific: Linux is known to be affected.  This vulnerability is tracked as and is fixed in D-Bus stable releases and and development release Upgrading is recommended.  Distributors who backport security fixes should use this commit:  On Unix platforms, this vulnerability was introduced in dbus versions and while fixing a portability bug, freedesktop.org The 1.2.x branch is not vulnerable.  On Windows, a similar bug exists in all branches that have Windows support. The D-Bus project does not support security-sensitive uses of D-Bus on Windows.
