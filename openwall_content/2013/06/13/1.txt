I suggest leaving the KDE Paste fix as-is and replacing KRandom with something that just fills an integer from /dev/urandom - then we can save a few CVE numbers for the rest of the year.  qrand() should probably also do the same, especially since cnonces for HTTP auth are using it - that means there's only (at best) possible cnonces...
