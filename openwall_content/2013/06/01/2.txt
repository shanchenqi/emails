If there is a target configured and listening on the network, a remote attacker can corrupt heap memory, and almost certainly gain kernel execution control. I only got as far as proving it could Oops the server.  It has been fixed in the upstream iscsi tree:   A follow-up has been posted fixing similar anti-pattern uses of strncpy(dst, src, strlen(src)) in the rest of the kernel:   Thanks,  -Kees  --  Kees Cook Chrome OS Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
