I would argue that no one will expect that giving a user the ability to run CGI scripts in a particular virtualhost context on the system gives them the ability to intercept and spoof traffic for all virtualhosts on the system.  Monkey does include virtualhost support and mentions shared hosting as an example usage scenario in the documentation.  http://monkey-project.com/documentation/virtual_hosts  >  > But not all webservers are expected to try to enforce running CGIs with > different security boundaries.

Indeed. I found it very interesting that you objected. To me this seemed to be a relatively straightforward issue. I appreciate you explaining your reasoning in more detail.
