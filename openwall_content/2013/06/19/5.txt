An attacker with direct write access to the memcache backend (or in a man-in-the-middle position) could insert malicious data and potentially bypass the encryption or signing security strategy that was specified. Only setups that make use of memcache caching in the Keystone middleware (specify memcache_servers) and using ENCRYPT or MAC as their memcache_security_strategy are affected.  python-keystoneclient fix (will be included in upcoming release):  References:  - --  Thierry Carrez (ttx) OpenStack Vulnerability Management Team -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with undefined - http://www.enigmail.net/  =a3MM -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
