ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  On AMD processors supporting XSAVE/XRSTOR (family 15h and up), when an exception is pending, these instructions save/restore only the FOP, FIP, and FDP x87 registers in FXSAVE/FXRSTOR.  This allows one domain to determine portions of the state of floating point instructions of other domains.  NOTE: This is the documented behavior of AMD64 processors, but it is inconsistent with Intel processors in a security-relevant fashion that was not addressed by the original implementation of XSAVE support on Xen.  This vulnerability is similar to concerning FXSAVE/FXRSTOR on AMD processors.  IMPACT ======  A malicious domain may be able to leverage this to obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys from another domain.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen 4.0 and onwards are vulnerable when run on systems with AMD processors supporting XSAVE.  Any kind of guest can exploit the vulnerability.  In Xen through as well as in Xen 4.1.x XSAVE support is disabled by default; therefore systems running these versions are not vulnerable unless support is explicitly enabled using the "xsave" hypervisor command line option.  Systems not using AMD processors, or using AMD processors not supporting XSAVE (i.e. families prior to 15h), are not vulnerable.  Xen 3.x and earlier are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  Turning off XSAVE support via the "no-xsave" hypervisor command line option will avoid the vulnerability.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.
