I suspect you will not want to be doing CVEs for most of these.  The ones I've seen so far aren't really security issues.  They're cases of command-line programs crashing on input, but usually input that is not feasibly under the control of an attacker (command-line options provided by the user, etc.).  My guess is that the vast majority of these problems are robustness issues, but are not security issues under any reasonable threat model that I can think of.  --  Russ Allbery (rra@...nford.edu)             <http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/>  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
