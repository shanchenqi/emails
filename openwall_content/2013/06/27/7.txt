However, in [2] you say is     for jPlayer XSS" but     says that is fixed in  (Maybe when you said     this also covered other unfixed versions UNTIL  3) - in [1] you assign to the security fix     that quotes the jPlayer changelog entry for - which, as just     mentioned in the previous bullet, you already described as being     associated with  In [2], you also state that     is for jPlayer XSS.  4) There is no mention of issues that are FIXED in based     on upstream changelog, but     lists fixes in both and  5) According to jPlayer release notes, we have:      Security Fix: The Flash SWF had a minor security vulnerability     that enabled XSS (Cross Site Scripting). Reported by Eugene Dokukin.     Security reference      Security Fix: Closed Flash SWF security vulnerability that     enabled XSS (Cross Site Scripting). Reported by Eugene Dokukin. Security     reference The jPlayer noConflict option is now     restricted to strings that contain the term jQuery. For example:     lib.jQuery or myjQueryRocks.      Security Fix: The Flash SWF had a security vulnerability that     enabled XSS (Cross Site Scripting). Reported by Malte Batram. Security     reference      Security Fix: The Flash SWF had a minor security vulnerability     that enabled XSS (Cross Site Scripting). Reported by Eugene Dokukin.     Security reference  I'm of the mindset to use the CVE assignments as provided by jQuery  upstream, but it may be good to get full clarity down to the individual  commits.
