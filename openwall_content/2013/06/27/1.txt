Christey" <coley@...re.org> Subject: 1.2k bug reports for Debian, some may be security  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1   From: Alexandre Rebert <alexandre.rebert@...il.com>  Hi,  I am a security researcher at Carnegie Mellon University, and my team has found thousands of crashes in binaries downloaded from debian wheeze packages. After contacting owner@...s.debian.org, Don Armstrong advised us to contact you before submitting ~1.2K bug reports to the Debian BTS using maintonly@...s.debian.org (to avoid spamming debian-bugs-dist).  We found the bugs using Mayhem [1], an automatic bug finding system that we've been developing in David Brumley's research lab for a couple of years. We recently ran Mayhem on almost all ELF binaries of Debian Wheezy (~23K binaries) [2], and it reported thousands of crashes. =================  I will of course be doing CVEs for these (*sob*). In order to make this possible though I'm going to need some help in the form of good CVE requests in this case I will be fascist. The following data will be required:  For each package: CVE requesters name / email (sending an email should be fine) Official Debian Package name Official upstream name and URL to site Affected version in Debian  Then for each vuln: Link to Debian bug entry Description of vuln/type (like one sentence) Link to code fix (mandatory) Attack outcome (is this a security vulnerability in other words)  Or else I will get steam rolled.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =1ITA -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
