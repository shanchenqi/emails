Given the high number of crashes we found, it is highely likely that some will impact security though.  Mayhem considered multiple input sources during the analysis of the 23K binaries: environment variables, command line arguments, files and standard input. Sockets was not one of them. That means that we only need to consider two attack vectors: (1) crashes of setuid/setgid programs, and (2) crashes with input files that are potentially untrusted.  For (1), I have not checked whether we found crashes in setuid/setgid programs yet. It is however straightforward to compile a list and forward it to whoever is filing the CVEs. They might not be exploitable, but a crash in such programs is concerning and might be worth a CVE. Let me know if that's something you'd like us to do.  For (2), it is difficult to automatically identify such crashes. As Steve mentioned, it may require a deep familiarity with the program. Package maintainers or upstream developers are the most suited people to judge whether a crash should be considered security critical. It is an unsatisfying solution, as the burden to report vulnerabilities would lie on them, but I don't see a way around it.  > I was under the impression from an incomplete read of the MAYHEM paper that > it could generate shellcode for code execution, yet I'm only hearing of > reports for crashes.

We are currently looking at them individually, and we will report all exploits that are security issues.
