For single user console machines, this generally just means you get the  text console login prompt instead.   For machines set up to support multiple seats, remote XDMCP access, or X terminals (such as LTSP setups using xdm), this may be a denial of service for users on those other seats/terminals /devices.  --  	-Alan Coopersmith-              alan.coopersmith@...cle.com 	 Oracle Solaris Engineering - http://blogs.oracle.com/alanc  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
