Advisory URL: PoC: Status: Reported to vendor by founder. No reply. Reproduced: Note: "Exploitation of this vulnerability is possible only when there is at least one password protected post on the blog."  I have no idea how many uses password protected blog posts and there isn't easy way to find out. This might also affect multisite installations. There is patch in advisory, which I did not verify.  --- Henri Salo  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
