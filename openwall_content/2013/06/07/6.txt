Yes, if you are using chroot for security, and only chroot for security, you're absolutely doing it wrong.  However, when used with an awareness of its limitations, as you quite rightly point out and enumerate, I argue chroot (and its more sophisticated cousins jail and pivot_root) does in fact provide some defense.  For example, think multiple different, mutually-distrusting applications on a host, one of which has a simple directory traversal bug, and the other of which mistakenly has sensitive files set to be world readable (but without any directory traversal issues).  chroot is great for that.  I would be less bugged by this if I hadn't repeatedly encountered well-intentioned folks who hear that argument and think that chroot is completely useless for security enforcement, rather than simply insufficient.  --  Tom Maher <tmaher@...oku.com>  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
