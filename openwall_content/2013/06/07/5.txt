STATUS OF THE FIX =================  Due to the unintended early release of these patches they have not received as much review or testing as we would have liked.  As discussed on xen-devel, the patches distributed with version 2 of the advisory are known to introduce regressions and also additional issues in the same have been discovered.  An updated patch series is in preparation.  Technical assistance with review of the drafts would be greatly appreciated.  Under the circumstances, we are sending version of this advisory out without any attached patches.  We have not yet been assigned a CVE number for this issue.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The ELF parser used by the Xen tools to read domains' kernels and construct domains has multiple integer overflows, pointer dereferences based on calculations from unchecked input values, and other problems.  IMPACT ======  A malicious PV domain administrator who can specify their own kernel can escalate their privilege to that of the domain construction tools (i.e., normally, to control of the host).  Additionally a malicious HVM domain administrator who is able to supply their own firmware ("hvmloader") can do likewise; however we think this would be very unusual and it is unlikely that such configurations exist in production systems.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen versions are affected.  Installations which only allow the use of trustworthy kernels for PV domains are not affected.  MITIGATION ==========  Ensuring that PV guests use only trustworthy kernels will avoid this problem.  RESOLUTION ==========  The patch series to properly resolve this issue is under development.  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =fELy -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
