Martin Borgert" <debacle@...ian.org> Subject: CVE Request -- tpp: Possibility of arbitrary code execution when  processing untrusted TPP template  Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,    A security flaw was found in the way tpp, a ncurses-based presentation tool, processed TPP templates containing --exec clause (input provided as an argument of the --exec clause would be immediately executed without requesting a second confirmation from the user). A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted text presentation program (TPP) template that, when processed with the tpp binary would lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the tpp executable.
