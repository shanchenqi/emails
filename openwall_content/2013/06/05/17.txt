For bonus points, once one registers a key with CPAN, CPAN could then even check one's uploads and disallow uploads that aren't signed with the proper key.  It would require work by the CPAN maintainers, but the general infrastructure is in place to do things like this and one could bootstrap from CPAN username/password.  --  Russ Allbery (rra@...nford.edu)             <http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/>  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
