Example:  points to  This is a problem because not all of the advisories contain CVE identifiers and now vulnerability databases are refering to old addresses. For example CVE-list refers to developer.joomla.org 64 times and OSVDB times.  Address http://developer.joomla.org/security.html still exists and for example works. Also http://docs.joomla.org/Security points to which is labeled "Security Announcements - Old"  Joomla: is this going to stay like this? Is there easy way to change the URLs?  --- Henri Salo  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
