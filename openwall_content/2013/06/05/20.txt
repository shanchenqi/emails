As another CPAN contributor (though much less prolific than Russ), i also think this would be great.  And wearing my hat as a member of the debian perl module packaging team, i would be very happy to see this level of author-specific cryptographic integrity checks when were updating packages from CPAN.  I suspect we have enough people interested in this within the debian pkg-perl to build in automated checks against these certifications during debian packaging as well.  Thanks for continuing to maintain such a great archive of useful, free code.  	--dkg    Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
