The bug is that if a system admin provides a disk (which supports the discard aka TRIM or SCSI UNMAP) to a guest as read-only - there are no checks done. Which means that the OS can destroy the data.  The likehood of somebody using 'ro' disks I think is small - but there is probably one person who does it and would be unhappy that a guest OS can destroy the underlaying data.  I have a patch (and a test-case) ready (see attached). I think I just need an CVE number and need to send the mentioned patch to Linus?
