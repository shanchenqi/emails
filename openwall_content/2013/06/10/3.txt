That depends on the post-install script.  In Debian's case, there are  some extensions because there is still some interactive package  installation left, but in general, the postinst script performs required  steps for properly integrating the new package with the rest of the system.  For Fedora and downstream, the postinst script should be  non-interactive, so it is really not much like configuration.  In general, it's desirable to do as much as possible in a declarative  fashion (for better auditing, rollback, etc.), but I don't anyone is  even close to that.  Anyway, if there's a bug in the postinstall script that causes an  exposure, it needs to be fixed.  With the prerm script, it's more  complicated because you can't fix it without executing it again. 8-)  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
