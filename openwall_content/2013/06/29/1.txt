Remote heap overflow  A remote attacker can cause a heap-based buffer overflow by sending an overly-large ZRTP packet of several possible types, including a "Hello" packet. Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of a vulnerable application.   2. Multiple remote stack overflows  A remote attacker can cause multiple stack-based buffer overflows by sending a malformed ZRTP Hello packet with an overly-large value in certain fields, including the count of public keys. Exploitation may be difficult due to the details of the layout of stack variables in memory, but successful exploitation would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of a vulnerable application.   3. Multiple remote heap memory disclosures  By sending a truncated ZRTP Ping packet, the response packet will include several bytes of the affected application's heap memory due to a lack of validation on the incoming packet. This flaw could be exploited to gain knowledge about the heap state of an affected application to enable further attacks, or potentially reveal sensitive information stored on the heap.   The fixes for all of these flaws were included in the following commit:   Regards, Dan   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
