Versions of MantisBT other than are not affected by this vulnerability.  A malicious MantisBT user holding privileged manager/administrator permissions could create a category or project name that contains JavaScript code. Any user visiting summary.php from that point on may then be exposed to having the malicious JavaScript execute within their browser environment.  The severity of this issue is limited by the need to hold privileged manager/administrator permissions in order to modify category and project names. However -- there are many use cases where MantisBT installations can have hundreds of sub-projects, each managed by different people/parties that can not or should not be fully trusted.  Refer to previous commits and to trace back the origin of this vulnerability.  References: [1] [2] [3]  Discussion on the MantisBT Developer Mailing List has indicated that a release of MantisBT (resolving both this vulnerability and which was announced on this list ~12 hours ago) will not occur until early next week. As such, a patch is attached for distributions packaging MantisBT It is recommended this patch be applied as soon as possible.  Can a CVE ID please be assigned to this issue?
