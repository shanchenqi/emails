Thank you && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team  ----- Original Message ----- Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,    the identifier has been originally assigned to the following issue:  When dnsmasq is used in conjunctions with certain configurations of libvirtd, network packets from prohibited networks (e.g. packets that should not be passed in) may be sent to the dnsmasq application and processed. This can result in DNS amplification attacks for example. [1]  Later it was found: [2] [3]  the upstream patch for it not to be working properly, as it still allowed (from [3]):  * replies to remote TCP-protocol based DNS queries (UDP protocol ones were corrected, but TCP ones not) from prohibited networks, when the --bind-dynamic option was used,  * when --except-interface lo option was used dnsmasq didn't answer local or remote UDP DNS queries, but still allowed TCP protocol based DNS queries,  * when --except-interface lo option was not used local / remote TCP DNS queries were also still answered by dnsmasq.  Could you allocate a new CVE identifier for this? (as an incomplete fix for issue)  Thank you && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
