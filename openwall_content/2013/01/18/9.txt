The fix we added to Drupal does not require (or implement) an update to the jQuery library at all; rather it works around the issue entirely within Drupal's code.  I think that means it should get its own CVE ID.  We did it this way because it means that any other Drupal packages, such as drupal7-jquery_update, would not be expected to have a vulnerability as long as the core update is applied.  I believe this means that yes, we will need a fourth CVE id to be allocated.
