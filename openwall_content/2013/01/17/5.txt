I was saying that sometimes there are admins that need help to manage forum sections like in an smf. I am part of the <http://elhacker.net> community, where there is only one admin and several co-admins. The admin does not trust his own shadow and has created a special user group from the group panel  called coadmin. This kind of user has been created with the same permissions as an admin with the exception of package installations and anything that might allow them to take total control of the server, and they are restricted only to the forum tasks. With this security breach, a user like this coadmin could be able to access the configuration file and read the database, thus being able to obtain the admin's session hash and later upload an ill-intentioned shell like a c99.php. This scenario repeats in many forums I visit, like <http://portalhacker.net> and  <http://el-hacker.com>. That's why I think it's an important security failure, since if smf is designed to protect directories and it doesn't do it properly, allowing file reading in an arbitrary way [Translator note: what follows might not make sense but it doesn't make sense in Spanish either, sorry] it's because for us it's not an isolated case  or so easy to detect, it's like the classic scenario of "is an xss high or low impact?"; it all depends on the scenario and in our cases it's something critical. Thanks for your attention Mr. Kurt ==================  Ok this makes sense, so basically you have a highly privileged forum admin that can read files such as the database config which is a definite problem.
