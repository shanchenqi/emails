They have all reported XSS vulnerabilities (which we’ve fixed) as part of our Security Bug Bounty Program. Thank you to them for making Piwik more secure!"  Security focus lists it, but it calls it just "Multiple Unspecified Cross Site Scripting Vulnerabilities".  No further details. And as piwik devs already statet here last year, they like security by obscurity so I don't think asking them will help.  Please assign CVE. (I think one for all XSS issues fixed in is enough).  cu, --  Hanno Böck		mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
