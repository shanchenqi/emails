Thanks.  I think the clearest part is <https://live.gnome.org/GnomeKeyring/SecurityPhilosophy>, which proclaims:  | * Try to keep your secrets from being swapped out or otherwise |   written to disk. | * Hunkering down and discarding all secrets when your computer is |   locked.  The documentation for gnome_keyring_lock_all_sync <http://developer.gnome.org/gnome-keyring/unstable/gnome-keyring-Keyrings.html#gnome-keyring-lock-all-sync> says:  | Lock all the keyrings, so that their contents may not eb accessed | without first unlocking them with a password.  In addition, <http://developer.gnome.org/gnome-keyring/unstable/gnome-keyring-Non-pageable-Memory.html> suggests that locked memory is never written to disk.  This is not true with hibernation.
