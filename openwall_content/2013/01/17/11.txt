Ubuntu is the only distribution that has by default enabled Privacy Extensions as far as I know. On your RHEL it's '0' and that's why you weren't seeing any 'ipv6_create_tempaddr' as previously mentioned on your emails. If you change this value to '2' you'll also see those kernel messages.  >  > Thank you. > -- > Prasad J Pandit / Red Hat Security Response Team > DB7A D3F9 7CD1 B5EB    Regards, --  George Kargiotakis https://void.gr GPG KeyID: GPG Fingerprint: 9EB8 31BE 07CE 4A0A 1BC8 E4F4 FFE6  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
