The patch has been updated. The incremental fix can be found at  Mitre have asked that two CVEs are used for the issues described here:  * now applies only to the stack-based buffer overflow    that was fixed in 4.2.  * applies to the large input validation issues.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Several HVM control operations do not check the size of their inputs and can tie up a physical CPU for extended periods of time.  In addition dirty video RAM tracking involves clearing the bitmap provided by the domain controlling the guest (e.g. dom0 or a stubdom). If the size of that bitmap is overly large, an intermediate variable on the hypervisor stack may overflow that stack.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest administrator can cause Xen to become unresponsive or to crash leading in either case to a Denial of Service.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen versions from 3.4 onwards are vulnerable.  However Xen 4.2 and unstable are not vulnerable to the stack overflow. Systems running either of these are not vulnerable to the crash.  Version 3.4, 4.0 and 4.1 are vulnerable to both the stack overflow and the physical CPU hang.  The vulnerability is only exposed to HVM guests.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only PV guests will avoid this vulnerability.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.
