We decided to keep instead of the other CVE that was reserved for this through MITRE a while ago. Also, we decided to cover this with one CVE entry even though the various issues discussed ("OS command injection and SQL injection" in the vendor advisory, and "perl code injection" in the researcher's advisory) can perhaps be interpreted in other ways.   - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =ys3d -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
