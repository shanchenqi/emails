Missing error handling cleanup in the handling code makes it possible for a guest, particularly a multi-vCPU one, to repeatedly invoke this operation, thus causing a leak of - over time - unbounded amounts of memory.  IMPACT ======  A malicious domain can mount a denial of service attack affecting the whole system.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Only Xen 4.2 and Xen unstable are vulnerable. Xen 4.1 and earlier are not vulnerable.  The vulnerability is only exposed by HVM guests.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only PV guests will avoid this vulnerability.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.  To fix both XSA 34 and XSA 35, first apply from XSA 34 and then *also* apply from this advisory.  To fix this issue without addressing XSA 34, use xsa35.patch.  $ xsa35*.patch   xsa35.patch $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJRACvBAAoJEIP+FMlX6CvZhWgH/AmojPzrSnLIPmP+kyphQeYk =jAmO -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment "xsa35.patch" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
