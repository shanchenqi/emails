Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: [Security hardening] [Notification] haproxy (previously) failed to  drop supplementary groups after setuid / setgid calls properly  Hello vendors,    just FYI notification that haproxy upstream has recently corrected [2] improper dropping of supplementary groups [1] after setuid / setgid calls.  We have further investigated this issue and have reasons to believe that  by itself this is NOT a security issue (another flaw would need to be found in haproxy this to be actually possible to use for something interesting).  For now we are considering this fix to be a preventive measure / security hardening (but took the time to notify you explicitly about this as you might still want to backport it into affected versions).
