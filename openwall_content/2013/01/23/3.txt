Wouldn't this just be rendered a crash?  Are you serious?

Nevertheless, you seem to shift your arguments. For each reason/attack vector I answer, you bring up two new reasons why this not an issue.  At the end, I did not spot the bug; if the majority thinks its not worth a CVE, I can live with it. It would just have made tracking easier.   regards, Sebastian  PS: Reminds me to the one-year dbus discussion where everyone told me that this can never be a problem.  --   ~ perl self.pl ~ ~ krahmer@...e.de - SuSE Security Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
