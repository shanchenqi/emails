FWIW, it's fairly common to run sort on untrusted input.  Compared to  other options, sort is widely available and surprisingly efficient.  But  those use cases probably run with LC_ALL=C (for performance) and do not  use the -d/-M options (for predictability), so they shouldn't be exposed.  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
