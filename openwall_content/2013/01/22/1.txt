Is this a security issue or not? Different scenarios have different outcomes:  1) The default account/password is well documented. The services forces you to change the password when first run and will refuse to run until you do change the password. Generally not considered a vuln.  2) The default account/password is well documented. The services does not force you to change the password when first run. Generally not considered a vuln as it falls into the "don't do stupid things" class of issues.  3) The default account/password is not well documented or not documented at all but can be changed. Generally this would be considered a vulnerability.  4) The default account/password is not well documented or not documented at all and can NOT be changed. Generally this would be considered a vulnerability.  Similar things for other things, is it a security vulnerability or security hardening, or not a security issue at all? It definitely gets fuzzy/messy sometimes.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =50LH -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
