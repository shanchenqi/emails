Setting "display_errors" to "On" for PHP is an EXPLICIT security NONO and generally well known (and the default is "Off"), so basically this is a "don't point the gun at your foot and pull the trigger because it will hurt" situation.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =Xgak -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
