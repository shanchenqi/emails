Weâ€™d like to thank security researchers > Gennady Kovshenin and Ryan Dewhurst for reviewing our work.  Basically it applies filters to pingbacks, things like:  return new IXR_Error(33, __('The specified target URL cannot be used as a target. It either doesn't exist, or it is not a pingback-enabled resource.')); so I was largely abl to confirm this one.  > - Two instances of cross-site scripting via shortcodes and post > content. These issues were discovered by Jon Cave of the WordPress > security team.  I found one instance of esc_attr() to esc_url() on a url used in embedded media, I'm guessing this is the XSS mentioned in the description as "post content"?  All I'm seeing for shortcodes related junk is in a big JavaScript blob wp-35/wp-includes/js/media-editor.min.js. It looks like this might need two CVEs if they are widely different.  > - A cross-site scripting vulnerability in the external library > Plupload.
