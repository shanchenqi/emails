The primary fix is to better validate a URL before triggering an HTTP request to it. You can see this with the filter and function pingback_ping_source_uri in It blocks credentials, odd ports, IPs, etc. Turning the error messages into generic errors was an additional defensive measure but due to the other fixes, does not address a particular vulnerability.  What these fixes target have already been written about publicly: http://www.acunetix.com/blog/web-security-zone/wordpress-pingback-vulnerability/  > - Two instances of cross-site scripting via shortcodes and post > > content.
