Can we get a CVE for the following  --  Access vector: network Access complexity: low Authentication requirement: none  Confidentiality impact: none Integrity impact: none Availability impact: complete  CVSSv2 temporal score: 6.4  Exploitability: functional exploit exists Remediation level: official fix Report confidence: confirmed  Summary:  All versions of Charybdis are vulnerable to a remotely-triggered crash bug caused by code originating from ircd-ratbox 2.0.  (Incidentally, this means all versions since ircd-ratbox 2.0 are also vulnerable.)  The bug has to do with server capability negotiation.  A malformed request will trigger a crash due to invalid assumptions.  Mitigation:  A patch for all affected versions of ircd-ratbox and charybdis is available from the charybdis GIT repository:    To apply the patch, go to your IRCd source tree and run the following commands:   $ patch -p1 < /path/to/downloaded/patchfile.patch   $ make   $ make install  Then you may hotfix the IRCd by running /MODRESTART as a server admin.  Details:  In ratbox-2, the following code was added to m_capab.c:   char *t = LOCAL_COPY(parv[i]);  The other logic was then modified to make use of that stack-allocated buffer rather than the original.  LOCAL_COPY() is a macro which expands to alloca() and strlcpy(), and the bug effectively is caused by this expansion calling strlen(NULL).   --   Thanks.
