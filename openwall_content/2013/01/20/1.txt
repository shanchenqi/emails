Some part of the certificate validation procedure were missing (relying on the work-in-progress v3 extensions), and because of this anyone with a correct end-entity certificate can issue certificate for any arbitrary domain, i.e. acting as a CA.  This problem has been fixed in tls-extra and I advise everyone to upgrade as soon as possible.  Despite a very serious flaw in the certificate validation, I'm happy that the code is seeing some audits, and would want to thanks Ertugrul Sรถylemez for the findings [1].  [1] https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/issues/29 ----cut---------cut---------cut---------cut---------cut---------cut-----  According to the upstream issue it should be fixed with commit [2].   [0]:  [2]:  Could a CVE for this issue be assigned?
