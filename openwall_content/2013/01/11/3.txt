The addRequestHeader method of the Apache HTTPClient module version 3.x seems to allow the injection of more than a header (potentilally the latest version 4.x too for addHeader method):  Using the following code, it includes a third header in the request:         HttpClient client = new HttpClient();         PostMethod method = new PostMethod("http://www.google.fr");         method.addRequestHeader("header1", "value1\r\nheader3: value3");         method.addRequestHeader("header2","value2");   The real risk is adding a second request using a similar code: req.addRequestHeader("Content-Length:0\r\n\r\n" + "POST\t/anotherpath\tHTTP/1.1\r\n" + "Host:host\r\n" + "Referer:faked\r\n" + "User-Agent:faked\r\n" + "Content-Type:faked\r\n" + "Content-Length:3\r\n" + "\r\n" + "foo\n", "bar");  Because of the Content-Length header, the sever will consider it as a seperate request.  Iis this an expected behavior ? if so developpers should be aware of the risk letting a user input values.
