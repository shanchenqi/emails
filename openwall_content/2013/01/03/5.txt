Answering myself:  In this blog post [1] the issue is explained in deep.  The bug is on RoR. Authlogic only is one of the possible vectors to trigger the bug. There is a known exploitable scenario that requires Authlogic to trigger this bug.  However other exploitable scenarios without Authlogic are possible.   So I think the description for is incorrect and should be amended ASAP. Otherwise it will lead to confusion. People not using Authlogic would believe (wrongly) that they are not affected.
