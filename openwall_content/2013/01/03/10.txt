So with this in mind:  http://www.magentocommerce.com/download/release_notes Release Notes - Magento (Jun 20, Fixed: Several potential security vulnerabilities  Please use for these issues.  But here's a hint: it would only take a few hours to hunt down the flaws. And according to the argument "these sites handle large volumes of money" it would be worth an attackers time to read the diff file, so this obscurity argument only hurts the users/admins since they will have to waste time figuring out if they need to apply this patch or not or if there is a workaround, or what they should do to see if they have already been attacked/etc.  Feel free to post a copy of this on their forums.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  uDfS/UySiC/aA3hvUNL6 =tvfI -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
