Pushes pointers on an automatic array without checking for overflow.  Can be used for DoS attacks. Will be extremely hard to make it execute arbitrary code.  Relevant upstream patch: [1]  References: [2] [3]  * Issue #2 - from [2]: ====================== * SECURITY: Possible buffer overflows when expanding file-names with long paths.  Affects expand_file_name/2.  Can lead to crashes (DoS attacks) and possibly execution of arbitrary code if an attacker can control the names of the files searched for, e.g., if expand_file_name/2 is used in a directory to which an attacker can upload files for which he can control the name.  Relevant upstream patch: [4]  References: [5] [6]  Could you allocate CVE ids for these? (iilc two should be enough)  Thank you && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
