Ok, so did some more digging based on some info from one of our developers that we had patched this in Fedora.  Looks like this patch introduced the leak on   And this patch reverted it on   So it looks like only was affected by this (which, judging by the patch in your bugzilla is the same version you're seeing as affected).  That might be a better patch to use than what you're using.  Anyways, this only affects (for any others using cronie and concerned as to whether or not they might be affected).  This was also reported to our bugzilla here:   >On Tue, Jan 08, at Vincent Danen wrote: >> * Sebastian Krahmer wrote: >> >>> "Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors," >>> >>> cronie leaks read-only fd's, please check here: >>> >>> >>> >>> can someone assign a CVE? >> >> Sebastian, do you have a specific command that you're using?
