There is no hidden info in our bugzilla; the reproducer is using lvm commands, but I remember it worked with any command. Actually its not about the warnings, a "cat" will probably also do, if you check its /proc/$pid/fd when its invoked. But cat doesnt emit warnings about open fd's.  Not sure about upstream, probably not.  regards, Sebastian   On Tue, Jan 08, at Vincent Danen wrote: > * Sebastian Krahmer wrote: > >> "Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors," >> >> cronie leaks read-only fd's, please check here: >> >> >> >> can someone assign a CVE? > > Sebastian, do you have a specific command that you're using?
