Sebastian, do you have a specific command that you're using?  I'm trying to reproduce this in Fedora and RHEL using lvdisplay (maybe a bad choice?) and also using "lvm vgck -v vg_thor && lvm pvs" in /etc/crontab.  The output is mailed to me fine with no warnings?  Can you share what command was being used to reproduce this?  It's possible that something you added (or we added) makes this a non-issue on other platforms.  Has upstream been informed of this yet?  --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
