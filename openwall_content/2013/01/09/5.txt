ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  When passing a device which is behind a legacy PCI Bridge through to a guest Xen incorrectly configures the VT-d hardware. This could allow incorrect interrupts to be injected to other guests which also have passthrough devices.  In a typical Xen system many devices are owned by domain 0 or driver domains, leaving them vulnerable to such an attack. Such a DoS is likely to have an impact on other guests running in the system.  IMPACT ======  A malicious domain, given access to a device which is behind a legacy PCI bridge, can mount a denial of service attack affecting the whole system.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen version 4.0 onwards is vulnerable.  Only systems using Intel VT-d for PCI passthrough are vulnerable.  Any domain which is given access to a PCI device that is behind a legacy PCI bridge can take advantage of this vulnerability.  Domains which are given access to PCIe devices only are not able to take advantage of this vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  This issue can be avoided by not assigning PCI devices which are behind a legacy PCI bridge to untrusted guests.  NOTE REGARDING EMBARGO TIMELINE ===============================  After discussion with the discloser we have decided to set a longer than usual embargo in order to avoid public disclosure during the holiday period.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.           Xen 4.2.x, xen-unstable                   Xen 4.1.x  $ xsa33*.patch   $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =+i2W -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
