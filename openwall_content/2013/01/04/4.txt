More precisely, the affected stable versions are and Rpm  (released on Dec 10th includes a fix already:   In addition, rpm alpha and beta1 test-releases are affected.  > An attacker could use this flaw to create a syntactically valid rpm > package, that could bypass the signature check.  To elaborate a bit, it's possible to create a package with an OpenPGP  signature that's either a) technically valid but one that rpm doesn't support (eg due to  "exotic" algorithms used) b) (intentionally) malformed one  In both cases, rpm issues an error about skipping package/header with  unverifiable signature but because of the flaw, continues nevertheless,  effectively bypassing signature checking in the package reading path  used by eg queries and installation. The explicit signature checking  path (ie 'rpm -K <package>') is not affected by the flaw.  --       - Panu -  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
