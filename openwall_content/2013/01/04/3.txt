Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org>,         Rex Dieter <rdieter@...h.unl.edu> Subject: CVE Request -- qt: QSslSocket might report inappropriate errors  when certificate verification fails  Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,    Qt upstream has recently announced (upcoming) availability of  Qt Qt and Qt which (between other things) should correct also the following security flaw:  A security flaw was found in the way QSslSocket implementation of the Qt, a software toolkit for applications development, performed certificate verification callbacks, when Qt libraries were used with different OpenSSL version than the one, they were compiled against. In such scenario, this would result in a connection error, but with the SSL error list to contain QSslError:NoError instead of proper reason of the error. This might result in a confusing error being presented to the end users, possibly encouraging them to ignore the SSL errors for the site the connection was initiated against.
