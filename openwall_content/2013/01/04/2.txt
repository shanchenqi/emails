This code path is exposed to PV guests via a hypercall allowing administrators of PV guests to crash the hypervisor if it is built with debugging enabled.  IMPACT ======  Malicious administrators of PV guests running on hypervisors built with the non-default debug=y option can crash the host.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Systems running Xen 4.2 and unstable are vulnerable to this issue. Xen 4.1 and earlier are not vulnerable.  Only systems built with debugging enabled are vulnerable. Debugging is not enabled by default.  Systems running PV guests or HVM guests using stubdomains are vulnerable. Guests which run only HVM guests without stubdomains are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  Building the hypervisor without debugging enabled will completely avoid this issue. Note that debugging is not enabled by default.  Avoiding running PV guests with untrusted administrators will also avoid this issue  NOTE REGARDING LACK OF EMBARGO ==============================  This issue was disclosed publicly on xen-devel; the person reporting it did not appreciate that it was a security issue.  Under the circumstances the Xen.org security team do not consider that this advisory should be embargoed.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.
