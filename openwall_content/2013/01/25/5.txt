The way these supplemental group issues work is that depending on the groups  file, the daemon may try to change to user/group "nobody", but retains group  root. This means that any file with group root write privs could be  replaced/altered. My experience is that distros have enough files that  permissions are wrong on something, somewhere. Its just a matter of finding it.  find / -type f -perm -printf "%-60p %g\t%M\n" 2>/dev/null  So, it boils down to the problem isn't a vulnerability by itself. However,  should a _real_ vulnerability be found in the program, the CVSS score would be  higher because the program has  -Steve   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
