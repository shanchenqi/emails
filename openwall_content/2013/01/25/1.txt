Why isn't this classified as a security vulnerability?  Well there is no way to exploit this that we're aware of, if you know a way to exploit this please let us know.  What would make this a security vulnerability? Let's say for example haproxy had an option to read or write to a file and did this with the privileges it failed to drop (granting the attacker privilege escalation) then it would be a security vulnerability.  So again, if you know of a way to exploit this please let us know, otherwise we will continue to consider this a security hardening issue and not a security vulnerability.  So as for this tweet:  "@chort0 â€¦ I didn't know about that claim -- I guess it explains why such great effort was made to not call it a vuln"  I wasn't aware of this claim by haproxy and to be honest I don't care. I assigned something like CVE's last year, trust me, I'm not afraid to annoy people by assigning CVEs that might embarrass them.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =77BF -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
