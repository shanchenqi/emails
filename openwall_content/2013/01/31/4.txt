A reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS) was identified in certain Drupal JavaScript functions that pass unexpected user input into jQuery causing it to insert HTML into the page when the intended behavior is to select DOM elements. Multiple core and contributed modules are affected by this issue.  Please use for this issue.    jQuery versions and higher provide protection against common forms of this problem; thus, the vulnerability is mitigated if your site has upgraded to a recent version of jQuery. However, the versions of jQuery that are shipped with Drupal 6 and Drupal 7 core do not contain this protection.  No CVE for this in Drupal as previously discussed. TLDR: no vuln no CVE, but preventing exploitation of third party components/etc is a nice and correct thing to do. Assigned a CVE for jQuery in previous email.  > Access bypass Book module printer friendly version - > Drupal 6 and 7  Please use for this issue.  > Access bypass Image module - Drupal 7  Please use for this issue.  > > (Greg is > release manager)  nothing here, see above.  >  > Related links:  > >  > Kurt, any open questions?
