ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  xen_failsafe_callback incorrectly sets up its stack if an iret fault is injected by the hypervisor.  IMPACT ======  Malicious or buggy unprivileged userspace can cause the guest kernel to crash, or operate erroneously.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All 32bit PVOPS versions of Linux are affected, since the introduction of Xen PVOPS support in  Classic-Xen kernels are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  This can be mitigated by not running 32bit PVOPS Linux guests.  32bit classic-Xen guests, all 64bit PV guests and all HVM guests are unaffected.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.  xsa40.patch  $ xsa40*.patch  xsa40.patch $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =9uNq -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment "xsa40.patch" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
