Actually I can't get any temporary address assignment with it. This is what I get upon booting with your patch:  [   sky2 eth0: Link is up at Mbps, full duplex, flow control both [   IPv6: ADDRCONF(NETDEV_CHANGE): eth0: link becomes ready [   IPv6: ipv6_create_tempaddr: ipv6 temporary address upper limit reached [   IPv6: ipv6_create_tempaddr: ipv6 temporary address upper limit reached [   IPv6: ipv6_create_tempaddr: ipv6 temporary address upper limit reached [   IPv6: ipv6_create_tempaddr: ipv6 temporary address upper limit reached [   Netfilter messages via NETLINK [   IPv6: ipv6_create_tempaddr: ipv6 temporary address upper limit reached [   IPv6: ipv6_create_tempaddr: ipv6 temporary address upper limit reached [  IPv6: ipv6_create_tempaddr: regeneration time exceeded - disabled temporary address support  # cat /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/eth0/use_tempaddr  -1  As I've already said to Eric Dumazet who's also been trying to provide a patch for the issue I think that the correct way to resolve the issue would be to follow the recommendations of  section <quote>    Even if hosts do enforce a limit on the number of IPv6 addresses    configured, an attacker might try to cause victim hosts to ignore    legitimate prefixes previously advertised for address configuration    by legitimate routers.  Hereby we recommend hosts to not discard    previously configured addresses if new prefixes for address auto-    configuration are advertised and the limit for the maximum number of    configured addresses (per interface) has been reached.  When such    limit is hit, the newly advertised prefixes for address auto-    configuration should be ignored. </quote>  Best Regards,  P.S. please CC me in your answers --  George Kargiotakis https://void.gr GPG KeyID: GPG Fingerprint: 9EB8 31BE 07CE 4A0A 1BC8 E4F4 FFE6  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
