The Qemu project has not itself issued an advisory. More information may be available in the advisories published by the distros:   CAVEAT ======  For full and accurate information please refer to those advisories. We have not conducted a full review of the information and patches provided.  The rest of the information in this advisory is true to the best of our knowledge at the time of writing.  IMPACT ======  The vulnerability impacts any host running HVM (Fully-Emulated) guests which are configured with an NIC (using in their VIF configuration. Note that the default emulated NIC is which is not vulnerable.  In a vulnerable configuration a hostile network packet may be able to corrupt the memory of the guest, leading to a guest DoS or remote privilege escalation.  We do not believe that this issue enables an attack against the host.  MITIGATION ==========  Limiting the size of network frames (e.g. by disabling jumbo frames) on the local network and the Xen bridge may reduce or eliminate guests' vulnerability to the bug.  RESOLUTION ==========  The patch is this git commit:    The fix has been applied to all qemu branches contained in Xen version 4.1 onwards. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
