In Debian Bugtracker it was closed [1] today. It is possible due to a bug in bcron-exec that cron jobs get access to the temporary output files from other jobs that are still running. This is also mentioned in upstream's NEWS[2]. The commit to fix this on github should be[3]. Even it looks bcron is not broadly used, could the above get a CVE?
