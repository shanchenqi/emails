This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier  Versions Affected:  2.3.x, 3.0.x Not Affected:       3.1.x, 3.2.x, applications using the yajl gem. Fixed Versions:      Impact - ------ The JSON Parsing code in Rails 2.3 and 3.0 support multiple parsing backends.  One of the backends involves transforming the JSON into YAML, and passing that through the YAML parser.  Using a specially crafted payload attackers can trick the backend into decoding a subset of YAML.  All users running an affected application should upgrade or use the workaround immediately.  Note: This is a separate vulnerability to if you are running a 2.3 or 3.0 application you must still take action to protect your application.  Releases - -------- The and releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds - ----------- If you are unable to upgrade, or apply the patches, you can work around this vulnerability by switching backends to the JSONGem backend.  Place this code in an application initializer:    ActiveSupport::JSON.backend = "JSONGem"  If you are running Ruby 1.8 you will need to ensure that the `json` or `json_pure` gems are installed and in your application's Gemfile. Ruby 1.9 includes this code already.   Patches - ------- To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series.  They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.  * 2-3-json-parser.patch - Patch for 2.3 series * 3-0-json-parser.patch - Patch for 3.0 series  Please note that only the 2.3.x, 3.1.x and 3.2.x series are supported at present.  Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.  Credits - -------  Thanks to Lawrence Pit of Mirror42 for discovering the vulnerability and working closely with us to ensure we shipped a comprehensive fix.  Thanks also to the RedHat security response team for helping us with regression testing.   - --  Cheers,  Koz -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (Darwin) Comment: Using GnuPG with Thunderbird - http://www.enigmail.net/  =5mPg -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  View attachment "2-3-json-parser.patch" of type "text/plain" bytes)  View attachment "3-0-json-parser.patch" of type "text/plain" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
