All are DoS issues.   From (2 issues):  Upstream released [1] Rack and to fix a denial of service condition when Rack parses content with a certain Content-Disposition header as noted in the original report [2].  This has been fixed in git [3].  Additionally, a second flaw that was fixed in and was also announced [4] that creates a minor denial of service condition, this time in the Rack::Auth::AbstractRequest, where it symbolized arbitrary strings (apparently this has something to do with authentication, but there is no further information provided other than the fix [5] itself, which is noted as "a breaking API change").

This has been fixed in git [2].   [1] https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rack-devel/-MWPHDeGWtI/discussion [2]    Could three CVEs be assigned for these issues please?
