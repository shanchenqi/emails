Function hostmask.c:try_parse_v4_netmask() is using strtoul to parse masks. Documentation says strtoul can parse "-number" as well. Validation of input does not catch evil bits. I can give proof of concept if needed.  Fixed in commit: Fixed in: ircd-hybrid  I have requested CVE identifier for this vulnerability in another email to Kurt. Other ircds are using the same code. Consider this email as official advisory. I tried to embargo this issue, but the commit is out already.  Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault. in try_parse_v4_netmask (text=<value optimized out>, at     addb[bits / 8] &= ~((1 << (8 - bits % 8)) - 1);  -- Henri Salo  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
