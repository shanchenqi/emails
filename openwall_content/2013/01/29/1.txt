On installations which have the Twitter widget activated (disabled by default, but in use on many installations), any authenticated user may add the Twitter widget to their activity / dashboard page. Editing its configuration allows the user to set the twitter_username parameter. The value stored in this parameter will be echoed without sanitation [2] when the users' activity / dashboard page is requested (by the same or any other user, authenticated or not).  According to changes committed [3] to their Git repository Elgg developers will provide a fix for this issue in the upcoming (?) release.  Reported by:   Moritz Naumann   http://moritz-naumann.com  A CVE ID has, to my knowledge, not yet been assigned. Secunia has assigned it  A slightly more complete advisory should hit FD and Bugtraq any minute.
