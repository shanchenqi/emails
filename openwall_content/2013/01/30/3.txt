Some of the qxl port i/o commands were waiting for the spice server to complete the actions, while the corresponding thread holds qemu_mutex mutex, potentially blocking other threads in the guest's qemu-kvm process. An user able to initiate spice connection to the guest could use this flaw to make guest temporarily unavailable or, in case kernel.softlockup_panic in the guest was set, crash the guest.  Upstream fixes: xf86-video-qxl commit  which relies on qemu-kvm functionality introduced by commit  References:  Thanks, --  Petr Matousek / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
