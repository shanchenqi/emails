If an application utilized the glibc's regular expression matching mechanism, an attacker could provide a specially-crafted input that, when processed would lead to that executable crash.  Upstream bug report: [1]  Relevant patch: [2]  More background: * (from Paolo): Jan 30 <bonzini> iankko: it is a memset(foo, 0, ...) that  overruns the buffer, so it's not controllable by the attacker  * but the denial of service scenario / attack vector is valid (consider network facing application using glibc's regexp matching on untrusted input)  Could you allocate a CVE id for this?  Thank you && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
