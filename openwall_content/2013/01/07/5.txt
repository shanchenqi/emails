Any local user that is using pseudo-terminal can be targeted.  As it may also be used to disclose sensible information such as password length, I was wondering if it should be treat as a security issue?                        Description + PoC:  No sure right now but I think the only way to solve this is to modify the pts handling at kernel level.  Any opinions on that?  Thanks, vladz.
