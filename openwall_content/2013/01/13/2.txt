Can this be assigned a CVE?  Uhmm I'm going to defer to Steven on this one:  1) is this a security issue? I'm not totally convinced it is. It's definitely broken behaviour. 2) Does this get a single CVE or one per broken client software?  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =JWSN -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
