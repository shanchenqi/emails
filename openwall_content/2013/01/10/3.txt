Sounds to me it is a - low impact - security issue and should get a CVE.  <hanno> one question about the release: is the "our of bounds read" security relevant? <hanno> this was asked on oss-security (i.e. the question if this should get a CVE id) <rillian> heh <rillian> hanno: it's a bounded out of bounds read <gmaxwell> Movers came to do a walkthrough this morning. <rillian> so it's definitely a denial of service <rillian> although we never managed to generate a crash example against Firefox <jmspeex> hanno: In *theory* could could cause a decoder to crash but so far (AFAIK) we haven't been able to even do that <gmaxwell> hanno: it can be a DOS at least for some kinds of callers. If the caller won't otherwise accept a packet >16mbytes (e.g. an rtp one) then it's not a concern. <derf> hanno: Well, when we asked the Mozilla security guys about it, they said <derf> <@dveditz> rillian: I'm pretty OK issuing CVE's for OPUS if we need to <derf> <@dveditz> but bugs like that don't typically get a CVE <derf> <@dveditz> otherwise Mitre would run out of numbers <rillian> :) <jmspeex> IOW, with a lot of effort you can achieve something nearly as scary as what anyone can achieve more easily though tons of other known issues  - --  Hanno Bรถck		mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG: -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  UwhegAJk4Tlhx/vt/wDb =5oMq -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
