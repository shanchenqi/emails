Also from previous research I have seen:  http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~dawnsong/papers/ssh-timing.pdf http://www.stanford.edu/~mlustig/SSH.ppt http://www.stanford.edu/~mlustig/ssh_report.pdf  /dev/ptmx would be ideal as you'd have no jitter to deal with and you could combine it with "w" and/or "ps" so you could for example correlate a user starting SSH up and then capture the timing of their username (followed by a pause) and then the password (followed by a pause) and so on.    - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  VabBXIAJPf5K9EaOuQRt =jNow -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
