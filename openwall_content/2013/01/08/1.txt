For example, I know you can use strace to capture keystroke "writes" for any given PID, but unless you want to capture only processes you are running you need to be root or use sudo strace <cmd>.  It looks like your PoCs fall into the same category. Following that same logic, if a user has root access, what would they gain by sniffing password character length? Since they can view hashes, change passwords, etc, without this method.  I might be completely wrong here but I personally wouldn't classify this as a security issue. Just putting in my own opinion, of course, as a casual reader of this list.
