(I've added you directly this time.)  Yes, I've seen this in the archives (on the openwall.com site).  I'm subscribed to the list, and now I received two messages from you -- one sent to me directly and another that went to the list.  For two other mails - the assignment (message from Kurt) and your note about it I received nothing at all.  I'll watch archives from now on, to detect further mail loss and to try to understand what's going on.  (And this is now not relevant to FreeSWITCH ofcourse... ;)  Thanks!  /mjt  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
