Cryptocat Nov. 7 This version pushes many important security fixes, detailed here on the Cryptocat Development Blog:  Cryptocat Nov. 1 Minor security fixes.  ==============  Second set of questions:  Then in http://tobtu.com/decryptocat.php  A number of other issues are mentioned, but I can't easily match them up to the changelog:  Date introduced	Days in Git	Difficulty rating Jul 9, so probably broken Sep 5, Medium Sep 11, Hard Oct 15, "Impossible" Oct 17, Medium Oct 29, Easy May 7, Encraption Apr 19, Medium Jun 3, "Impossible"  Can you provide links to the commits for these issues?
