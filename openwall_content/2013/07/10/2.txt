The thing is that I did _not_ get a reply, and did not get Adam's message either.  I see them now in the archives but not in my inbox. Will try to find out what happens (it's a second time in more than 10 years when I see apparent mail loss at my side; first time turned out to be bad defaults in mailman which didn't sent me messages which were also Cc'd to me, so it wasn't actually my side).
