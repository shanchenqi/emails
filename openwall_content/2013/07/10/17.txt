It looks like this might leave open a classic symlink race such that one user could control the location where another user unpacked packages coming from an npm installation.  if the superuser was the one running npm, this might have led to a non-privileged user who wins the race getting a privilege escalation as well, depending on the contents of the fetched package.  The issue appears to have been fixed upstream today, here:     I first learned about the problem during a related a bug report (cc'ed here)  If you think this needs a CVE, could you assign one please?
