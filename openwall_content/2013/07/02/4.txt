This issue does not affect upstream.    [1]   [2]  Spender suggest there is a integer problem in the code [3], but there is not. The problem spender is trying to fix is avoided by the CMSG_OK check in ip_cmsg_send() function and msg_controllen check in __sys_sendmsg().  There is some slight room for error though since CMSG_OK checks for "(cmsg)->cmsg_len >= sizeof(struct cmsghdr)" and the expression is "err = cmsg->cmsg_len - CMSG_ALIGN(sizeof(struct cmsghdr));" but with the current alignment and cmsghdr struct size we should be fine on both 32 and 64bit.
