More details can be found on the Red Hat bug report at but it basically boils down to a wrong selection when choosing the the keyid for a destination email address.  Basically, when you have multiple keys in the keyrings, with overlapping email addresses (like foo@...mple.com and foobar@...mple.com), you can end up (silently) encrypting to the wrong recipient.  It actually happened to me when forwarding embargoed security issues so it can happen in real life. Now the wrong recipient would need to actually obtain a copy of the sent mail (since it's sent to the correct recipient, not the wrong one), but I still think it warrants a CVE.  Quick fix was to use the documented format for email searches in GnuPG (using <> around email addresses) but a more complete fix for explicit key selection should appear some time in the future.
