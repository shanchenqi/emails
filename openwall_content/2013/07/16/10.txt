I am relatively new at CVE requests so I am learning-by-doing. I must have missed the original comment you feel you're re-iterating to me.  Relevant code can be found here:  [1]   Upstream doesn't appear to have a public version control repo which is why I didn't post link(s) to commit(s). I mistakenly thought their changelog annoucement would be enough.  I enjoy contributing time to the community via code submissions and by making flaws/fixes known to vendors via this list. I just hope they don't all have to raise my blood pressure in the future.  --mancha   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
