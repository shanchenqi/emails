Additionally, on enabled Linux systems, DES or MD5 encrypted passwords passed to crypt() fail with EPERM (w/ NULL return). ---  A project of mine, which began with helping the Slackware Linux team patch their Shadow tools suite to properly handle possible NULL returns from glibc crypt(), has since evolved into a larger project where I have been working with developers to introduce needed protections to prevent crypt() NULL pointer dereference situations. So far the list includes: cvs, gdm, KDE/kdm, KDE/kcheckpass, shadow-tools, slim, tcsh, Xorg/xdm, and yp-tools.  My policy has been to make public my fixes once upstream developers had a chance to commit fixes. The only exceptions are: cvs (inactive project), shadow-tools (Christian Perrier let me know Shadow-tools development is temporarily halted), and yp-tools (I have been repeatedly unable to contact Thorsten Kukuk). The gdm fix was not shared with Gnome because gdm, as of no longer supports non-PAM authentication.  The security implications of these issues vary in nature and severity. So far, only xdm has an associated CVE:  My progress is being documented in Slackware's de facto bug & discussion forum (linuxquestions.org). You can view thread here:   Finally, I am placing patch files along with a signed digest file in a sourceforge project:  Cheers,  --mancha  P.S. I was not involved with the fixes for screen, ppp, dropbear, and popa3d. I documented the upstream fixes, however, for Slackware's benefit.  == PGP Key ID: Key fingerprint = 7F1F E9BF 77CF 15AC 8F6B  B5AB F4FF ==   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
