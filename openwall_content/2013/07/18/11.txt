So please use: > > swfupload KedAns-Dz object injection > swfupload KedAns-Dz XSS > swfupload KedAns-Dz CSRF  (XSS) is actually And, (CSRF) seems to be just the potential for CSRF via XSS -- don't think this is a separate issue.  Neither of those are reproducible in https://github.com/wordpress/secure-swfupload.  We're aware of and intend to fix it soon, but it's really tough to classify "image injection" as a serious vulnerability without there being any actual XSS there to further trick the user.  > Also alerting WordPress.
