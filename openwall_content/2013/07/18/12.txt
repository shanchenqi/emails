We might be dealing with a CVE *triplicate*.  There have been a lot of disclosures about swfupload.swf lately with... ummm... mixed levels of detail and varying levels of researcher skill and diligence.  For example, the movieName parameter vector was given by Kurt in July of for an April disclosure -  (assignment is in but is listed for the "libjs-swfupload" package).  The that Kurt just assigned also involves the movieName vector.  Since swfupload.swf is apparently widely used, researchers may be finding the same issue over and over again in different packages, and presenting them as if they are new.  Yet there might be some attack variants buried in there, too.  Because of the amount of attention by researchers who don't check whether an issue has already been disclosed, and/or the number of independent products that use this library, any "new" swfupload.swf issues should be regarded with extreme suspicion while CVE tries to iron out all the existing duplicates.  Andrew Nacin said:  (XSS) is actually  only public details are that it's an unspecified vulnerability in Wordpress before yet is pretty vague and mentions multiple products (although it does credit Neal Poole for at least one issue).  That said, a statement by a lead developer of Wordpress is important for this clarification ;-)  Andrew, can you confirm for sure that is *also* the same as for Neal Poole's movieName vector?  - Steve   >-----Original Message----- >From: andrewnacin@...il.com [mailto:andrewnacin@...il.com] On Behalf Of >Andrew Nacin >Sent: Thursday, July 18, PM >To: Kurt Seifried >Cc: Open Source Security; Jay Turla; nacin@...dpress.org >Subject: [oss-security] Re: SWFUpload <= (Object Injection/CSRF) Vulnerabilities >Multiple flaws > >On Thu, Jul 18, at PM, Kurt Seifried <kseifried@...hat.com> wrote: >> This was brought to my attention by Jay Turla <shipcodez@...il.com>, >> after some searching I found: >> >> >> >> and after testing (it works).
