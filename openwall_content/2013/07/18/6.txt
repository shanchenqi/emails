That's annoying :P As for the requirements it depends, different CVE requesters have different requirements depending on how well they do things. E.g. Some do CVE very well, but to make absolutely sure SPLIT/MERGE is done right I request some details, others like Drupal have security advisories that are sufficiently detailed that i can assign based on them alone, so until a CVE requester proves that they know what they are doing, reliably, I'm going to need details to make sure the CVE assignment is done correctly. Part of the issue is scale, I do CVE assignments a year, so if they start taking more then minutes I won't have time to do anything else (like my day job, or sleep).  > I enjoy contributing time to the community via code submissions and > by making flaws/fixes known to vendors via this list.
