Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org>,         Gallery3 Security Team <security@...leryproject.org> Subject: CVE Request -- gallery3 Fixing two security flaws  Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,    Gallery upstream has released version, correcting two security flaws:   [1]  My guess [***] is the two issues are as follows:  * Issue #1 - Improper stripping of URL fragments in flowplayer SWF file might lead to reply attacks (a different flaw than ----------------------------------------------------------------------------    A security flaw was found in the way flowplayer SWF file handling functionality   of Gallery version 3, an open source project with the goal to develop and   support leading photo sharing web application solutions, processed certain   URL fragments passed to this file (certain URL fragments were not stripped   properly when these files were called via direct URL request(s)). A remote   attacker could use this flaw to conduct replay attacks.    A different vulnerability than    Upstream ticket:   [2]    Relevant upstream patch:   [3]    References:   [4]  * Issue #2 - gallery3: Multiple information exposure flaws in data rest core module -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Multiple information exposure flaws were found in the way data rest core module   of Gallery version 3, an open source project with the goal to develop and support   leading photo sharing web application solutions, used to previously restrict access   to certain items of the photo album. A remote attacker, valid Gallery 3 user, could   use this flaw to possibly obtain sensitive information (file, resize or thumb path   of the item in question).    Upstream ticket:   [5]    Relevant upstream patch (against 3.0.x branch):   [6]    References:   [7]  Could you allocate CVE identifiers for these?  Thank you && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team  [***] Guess because the issues aren't more thoroughly described in upstream announcement [1]       and former (private) email check with Gallery3 upstream didn't provide more details       either. Cc-ed them on this post too, they to correct me where necessary.
