There has to be desirable information for others in the Open Source community (e.g., an upstream maintainer may announce a new version of their software with security fixes to be picked up by distributors)."  This guideline exists largely to avoid content duplication (as far as non-end-users are concerned), which we'd see here if multiple distro vendors were announcing their updates in here (since many if not most of those updates would be for packages based on shared upstream code, and thus for upstream code vulnerabilities that have already been reported in here separately).  Given the above, I think it makes some sense to allow/encourage distro vendor advisories for their own distro-specific issues to be posted in here.  This may seem counter-intuitive at first, but note that there's no content duplication problem with those, and the distro is acting as a (potential) upstream when they're announcing their own vulnerability/update (relevant to be picked up by other distros who may have reused that component or have otherwise similar code, and relevant to all of us as an opportunity to learn from and potentially avoid making a similar mistake or whatever the cause of the vulnerability was).  Looking at two recent FreeBSD advisories, I think is desirable for oss-security. is less so.  Was the underlying BIND issue mentioned in here, though?  It should have been!  If this was in fact the first mention, then better to have it in this form than none at all.  Now, I realize that selective posting of a distro vendor's security advisories to a mailing list could be confusing (an end-user could then expect to see all advisories from the vendor, and would possibly not subscribe to an appropriate channel as a result of such confusion). So maybe for things like non-end-user / non-advisory postings will work better, even if they refer to the end-user advisory for more info.
