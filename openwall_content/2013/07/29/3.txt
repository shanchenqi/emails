Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org>,         phpMyAdmin security team <security@...myadmin.net>,         Mitre CVE assign department <cve-assign@...re.org> Subject: CVE Request -- phpMyAdmin and are released  Hello Kurt, Steve, phpMyAdmin security team, vendors,    phpMyAdmin upstream has recently released and of phpMyAdmin administration too:   [1]  correcting multiple security flaws is reserved for future use, see [1]): * * * * * * *  Doesn't look CVE identifiers have been already allocated to these?  Could you assign them? (Cc-ing phpMyAdmin security team to confirm these weren't assigned yet [and Mitre's CVE assigning department since having an impression, we have previously discussed this and the conclusion was Mitre CVE department will assign them {but maybe it wasn't case of phpMyAdmin, not sure right now}]).
