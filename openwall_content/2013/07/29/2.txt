Thanks for any feedback,  Cheers  --  --                   Alexandre Dulaunoy (adulau) -- http://www.foo.be/ --                             http://www.foo.be/cgi-bin/wiki.pl/Diary --         "Knowledge can create problems, it is not through ignorance --                                that we can solve them" Isaac Asimov  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
