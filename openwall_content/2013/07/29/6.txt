For large projects like FreeBSD this obviously won't be a problem. But what should we do in future to make it easy to see what happened to CVE assignments? cve-advisories@? tell people I assign to email mitre directly (but I have no way to know if that gets done/etc.), something else? Steven any requests/comments?  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  N+mgHZXoD5BwN/3wfgua =/zBY -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
