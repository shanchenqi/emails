So like we have a single CVE for the issue and any future instances can be submitted to cve-assign@ for addition? Problem is this CVE would become monstrously huge and unwieldy.  >> However the world is changing, for example a program that >> included an auto-updater component that was advertised as being >> "Secure" but went over HTTP would probably qualify for a CVE. >  > It probably would, but since this might theoretically affect any > software that's 5 years old or more and downloads anything over > unencrypted channels without integrity checks, the raw number of > CVEs that could be assigned is rather daunting.  Yup. Maybe only apply it to common software/software that advertises "Secure" updates? Seems like a cop out (I vote we do it right or not at all, but first define what "right" is =).  >> Steve I'm bouncing this to you, I'm inclined to NOT assign a CVE >> since it opens up a huge can of worms (every single bit of >> JavaScript served from HTTP and not available via HTTPS ever), >> but I can also see how it should maybe get a CVE. >  > My gut reaction is that you might be treating this as a more > complex issue than it really is.

One thing I've been thinking about is all the software on the planet that I have no real clue as to how secure/well developed it (to say nothing of how well a packager like Fedora/Debian/Ubuntu/Dreamhost[1]/etc cares for it). Some signals exist, like do they have a security@ contact that actually replies? Do they have a bug tracker? Do they offer updates? Did they set static SSH host keys? In general we have no way of knowing, perhaps OSVDB/someone wants to start collecting data on known good and known bad software projects in addition to vulnerability info (e.g. has "bugtracker, URL is at, bonus point for supporting security bugs that are private)"? But then the legal issues "you said something mean about us so we're taking you to court in the UK for libel" come up and I basically give up since I have no answer for that one =).
