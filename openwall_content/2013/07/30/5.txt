The mirroring support, (located at, a.pyp.python.org, b.pypi.python.org, âŚ) which that commit adds and deals with, was supposed to have authenticity checking preventing a malicious mirror operator from attacking you by checking a html manifest that included hashes was signed by a key owned by the central index (pypi.python.org). That commit does not include checking that the mirrors are not hosting content that differs from the central index.  So basically the lack of authenticity checking when installing directly from the central index is a separate issue which has been (mostly) addressed with pip 1.3, and more so with 1.4.  However this request deals explicitly with the implementation of the protocol for installing from the hosts that mirror the central index, but are not the central index.  For what it's worth my PR to fix it is here  Between myself, the comment on the PR, and the mailing list I have 3 pip developers +1ing the change so it's likely it's going to land unless one of the others has concerns.  ----------------- Donald Stufft PGP: // 7C6B 7C5D 5E2B F04F 6E3C BCE9 DCFA   Content of type "text/html" skipped  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
