E.g. seems to be from a Google CNA, right? (At least is for Chrome)  All these issues (and all the ones in previous rounds) were found through fuzzing done at Google by Mateusz "j00ru" Jurczyk and Gynvael Coldwind.  It would be very, very welcome if CVE assignments from either ffmpeg or libav for any such issues would have a reference to the filename of the fuzzed file triggering the problem.  With the diverging code bases between ffmpeg and libav [1] it becomes very complicated to properly track down if one of the two is affected.
