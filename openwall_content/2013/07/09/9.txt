CVE numbers may not appear in the Mitre or NVD CVE databases for some time (days, weeks, months or potentially years) due to issues that are embargoed (the CVE number has been assigned but the issue has not been made public), or in cases where the entry is not researched and written up by Mitre due to resource issues. The benefit of early CVE candidacy is that all future correspondence can refer to the CVE number. Information on getting CVE identifiers for Open Source issues is available from Red Hat.   - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =orw1 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
