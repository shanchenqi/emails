A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service.  If a malicious Ceph monitor sends an auth_reply message with the value of -EAGAIN in the result field, ceph_build_auth_request() will call the ceph_auth_client_ops->build_request() function pointer without checking to see if the build_request() pointer is NULL. The auth_none handler does not initialize its build_request() pointer.  See for more information.  The fix can be found in the upstream ceph-client.git tree:   Tyler   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
