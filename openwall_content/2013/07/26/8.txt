E.g. you fixed the issue referred to in in mongodb but then label it with  2) are these in fact in need of a CVE merge? (seems unlikely since one is mongodb, and the other is the python driver, so different code bases)  3) some other option?  I guess my biggest concern right now is confirming that ( is in fact fixed in release of mongoDB.
