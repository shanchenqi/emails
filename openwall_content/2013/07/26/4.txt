First issue: ------------   Python's pip versions 1.4.x and earlier are vulnerable to an Arbitrary Code   Execution Attack due to incorrect regexp parsing of external download links   in the following functions in pip/index.py:      * PackageFinder._get_pages()     * PackageFinder._sort_links()     * PackageFinder._package_versions()     * PackageFinder._link_package_versions()    Which allow an attacker with the ability to Man-in-the-Middle external   package URIs (which often include external HTTP URIs, and can include the   module author's personal website, see     to specify an arbitrarily high package version number and gain code   execution.    Uptream bugtracker reports:                                  Other mentions:                      This issue is fixed in pip>=1.5.x by Donald Stufft in the following commits:      Second issue: -------------   Python's pip versions 1.5.x and earlier use MD5 hashes for verification of   package integrity against PyPI (which defaults to providing MD5).  These issues appear to be unrelated to Donald Stufft's CVE ID request filed earlier today, and additionally unrelated to the following already assigned CVEs:    * Pip builds in /tmp                 * uses a default package index without SSL          --   âĽâś isis agora lovecruft _________________________________________________________ GPG: Current Keys: https://blog.patternsinthevoid.net/isis.txt  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
