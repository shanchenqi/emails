Please use  for this issue.  Also Werner if you want to get CVE's in advance of announcements for security issues I would be happy to pre-assign them to you. Email me for details or check out:  https://people.redhat.com/kseifrie/CVE-OpenSource-Request-HOWTO.html  This of course goes for any other projects that want to get CVEs in advance.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =w6xH -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
