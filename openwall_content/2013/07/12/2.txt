The initial CVE request stated that corrected these flaws but as a matter of fact only the commits from pull request  and commit are contained. - The other issues are  fixed in our git master branch.   We've created a snapshot that contains all the fixes mentioned above:  md5: sha1:  We will also review our current stable version to check if the issues  exist there as well and publish an update if required.
