Additionally, on enabled Linux systems, DES/MD5-encrypted passwords passed to crypt() fail with EPERM (w/ NULL return).  When authenticating against Cyrus-sasl via mechanisms that use glibc's crypt (e.g. getpwent or shadow auth. mechs), and this crypt() returns a NULL as glibc does on above-described input, the client crashes the authentication daemon resulting in a DoS.
