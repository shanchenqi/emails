The first one is a somewhat odd special case, as this isn't a newly-discovered vulnerability.  However, it's become clear that brute-force attacks on DES are immediately practical, prompting a reimplementation of the security layer that's being treated as a security release by the OpenAFS project.  (Also, it's been an embarassment for some time that AFS didn't have crypto agility and didn't support anything stronger than DES.  That's finally fixed.)  The two vulnerabilities are:  OpenAFS Security Advisory      OpenAFS uses Kerberos tickets to secure network traffic. For     historical reasons, it has only supported the DES encryption algorithm     to encrypt these tickets. The weakness of DES's 56 bit key space has     long been known, however it has recently become possible to use that     weakness to cheaply (around and rapidly (approximately 23 hours)     compromise a service's long term key.      This vulnerability is a particular problem for OpenAFS because DES is     the only encryption algorithm supported in current releases.  OpenAFS Security Advisory      The -encrypt option to the 'vos' volume management command should     cause it to encrypt all data between client and server. However, in     versions of OpenAFS later than it has no effect, and data is     transmitted with integrity protection only. In all versions of     OpenAFS, vos -encrypt has no effect when combined with the -localauth     option.
