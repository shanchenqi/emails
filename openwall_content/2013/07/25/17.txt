But I was > hoping VLC upstream might help out.  It's not that we don't care about CVE IDs. But "upstream VLC" is upstream VLC, i.e. the VLC code base. We just do not have the resources and expertise to evaluate FFmpeg/libav security issues individually.  Besides, VLC can be linked dynamically with many different FFmpeg or libav versions. So keeping track of their security issues within the context of VLC is more or less impossible. That is up to the VLC binary packagers, not to upstream developers.  --  RĂŠmi Denis-Courmont Sent from my collocated server  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
