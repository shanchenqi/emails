I think one concern was where do you want to place policy decisions for key usage and trust, in GPG, in the app using it, or something else? One concern I have is I sometimes used to (not any more!) download all the signing keys for keys I was using to see if I could establish a web of trust. Of course anyone can sign someone elses key and upload that to the public key servers, so then the potential for grabbing a key from a bad guy increases significantly.  Any ways for evolutions please use for this issue. Has anyone checked other popular mail clients like thunderbird/mutt/etc?   - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =UVD4 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
