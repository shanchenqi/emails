To reiterate: so I can confirm CVE assignments, and prevent duplicate assignments you *MUST* provide links to the code commits/vulnerable code. I don't have the time to go hunting through your source code for them. People need to start making better CVE requests, or you're not going to get CVEs from me.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  6CozuVk6Acmye/PfOrQW =T3Uy -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
