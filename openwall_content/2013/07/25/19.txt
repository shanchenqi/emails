I don't think anyone's being deliberately obstructive here, I  know I certainly try my best to give you clear, short descriptions so  that you don't have to waste time going through others' code if you  don't need to. I'm not trying to make your job harder, I'm trying to help.  > Having QUICK access to the source code vulns/corrections makes all the > above much much easier.  Sure, I'll make sure you have it it future. From my point of view,  however, a lot of these things are caused by subtle interactions of  various mistakes that would be harmless on their own. That makes it  harder to provide useful source code as it could easily look correct.  For example, the Zope application server uses the presence of  documentation as an in-band marker of if something is public or private;  just sending you a link to the removal of docs would be pretty confusing.  > You're not asking for CVE's in a vacuum.

The reason I write descriptions and include my estimates of CWE  identifiers and CVSS scores is precisely because I know lots of people  read these lists, and it matters to me to reduce the amount of work they  have to go through.  I'd be surprised to learn that more people care  about the commits themselves rather than the information in an easy to  consume format.  > CVE assignment to follow tomorrow because it's 3am here.
