Quite honestly I want to go through your source code, or for that matter any ones source code I'm not personally responsible for like I want to get kicked in the face by a horse.  But I also want to make sure CVE's get assigned correctly. So three main problems arise:  1) Does the issue(s) need a CVE? sometimes they are security hardening that look a lot like security vulnerabilities, but ultimately are not (see Steven's recent email about timing attacks/user name disclosure in Django for a good example of this).  2) incorrect SPLIT/MERGE of issues (it can be subtle)  3) duplicate CVE assignments  Having QUICK access to the source code vulns/corrections makes all the above much much easier.  Plus I'm not the only one analysing these issues, other open source vendors who ship your code may want to back port the fix, or make sure the fix is correct, or look for similar problems in your source code.  Then you've got companies like iSIGHT Partners and iDefense (whom I formerly contracted for) that are just two of literally HUNDREDS of companies that go through all the stuff posted here (and Bugtraq/Full-Disclosure, and every other security list on the planet). This means rather then HUNDREDS of people having to hunt down the specific source code links/patches the original CVE requester makes sure it gets taken care. This scales and is much more efficient. Plus the original requester is a lot more likely to get it correct.  You're not asking for CVE's in a vacuum. CVE's are widely used by literally millions of people and organizations, we need to make sure they are done right or we will cause an obscene amount of time and money to be wasted.  CVE assignment to follow tomorrow because it's 3am here.   - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =8Vjl -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
