In [1] Steven Chamberlain pointed out that in upstrem the "start" and "end" time fields are still not filtered.  Tobi Oetiker fixed this in a commit following the release at [2]. But this version is no yet released.   [1]  [2]  Does this also needs a separate CVE, as a subsequent fix to the release?
