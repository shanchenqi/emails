A specially crafted archive file can be used to trigger creation of arbitrary files in any location, writable by the user executing the extraction, outside the current working directory. This behaviour is triggered when the option 'Keep directory structure' is selected from the application 'Extract' dialog.  The issue is present on File Roller installations which have been compiled with libarchive support, used to handle tar, cpio, lha, 7zip, ar archiving formats and ISO images. The libarchive support is enabled by default.
