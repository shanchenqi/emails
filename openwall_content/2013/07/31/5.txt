The details (I assume) are here  As far as I know none of the pip maintainers requested it. I assume (going by the bugzilla) that CVE is for the fact pip didn't use TLS or any other authentication method when downloading from the central index. That was fixed in 1.3 which was releases March  I don't know who "owns" that CVE or anything about it. The only reason I even know it exists is the red hat page showed up in a google search when I was looking for pip CVE's to match fixes up to. I'm not sure what I can (if anything?) do as a pip developer to unreserve it?  ----------------- Donald Stufft PGP: // 7C6B 7C5D 5E2B F04F 6E3C BCE9 DCFA   Content of type "text/html" skipped  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
