The latest release makes use of shared memory with permissions to maintain slots with one struct for each connection/process. An unprivileged user can mark mark all remaining slots as occupied (and optionally wait for remaining clients to leave to block those slots, too).  To demonstrate the issue, I have written a small command line tool. It's free software and can be found at [2].  Use it like this:    # make   cc -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic local-dos.c -o local-dos    # ./local-dos   USAGE:     ./local-dos (block|unblock|show)    # watch -n 1 -d ./local-dos block   [..]  Besides the local DoS it might be possible to attack the call to chdir, since that is reading from shared memory, too.  Any ideas on other attacks based on writing to that block of shared memory?  File /bin/MySecureShell is mode setuid root if that makes it more interesting :-)  Best,    Sebastian   [1] http://mysecureshell.sourceforge.net/ [2] https://github.com/hartwork/mysecureshell-issues  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
