I also tried "https://coinwidget.com/widget/coin.js" and it failed (you can telnet to the port, it's open, but I got an SSL error). If you try "https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=coinwidget.com+" you'll see the same.  > I believe this vulnerability is an example of Does it need > a CVE identifier?  The problem is not in the code, the problem is in how the code is served/distributed. CVE is traditionally for software and not for services. So under a simplistic reading of that strict definition I would say this doesn't deserve a CVE.  However the world is changing, for example a program that included an auto-updater component that was advertised as being "Secure" but went over HTTP would probably qualify for a CVE.  Steve I'm bouncing this to you, I'm inclined to NOT assign a CVE since it opens up a huge can of worms (every single bit of JavaScript served from HTTP and not available via HTTPS ever), but I can also see how it should maybe get a CVE.  The good news is that future versions of Firefox are implementing a security policy that when loading a page from HTTPS they will not load page components from HTTP, which would fix this issue. Hopefully all the browsers do this.  >  > I have copied the creator of Coin Widget on this email. >  > Thank you for your time, Evan Teitelman. >    - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =S3oH -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
