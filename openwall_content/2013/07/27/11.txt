Coin Widget is a Bitcoin and Lightcoin donation widget. Its code is normally downloaded from http://coinwidget.com/widget/coin.js in the following manner.  <script src="http://coinwidget.com/widget/coin.js"></script> <script> CoinWidgetCom.go({     wallet_address:     , currency: "bitcoin"     , counter: "count"     , alignment: "bl"     , qrcode: true     , auto_show: false     , lbl_button: "Donate"     , lbl_address: "My Bitcoin Address:"     , lbl_count: "donations"     , lbl_amount: "BTC" }); </script>  Without SSL or similar protection, it is possible for the code to be modified in transit. A malicious individual could modify the code to replace a legitimate wallet address with his or her own.  I believe this vulnerability is an example of Does it need a CVE identifier?  I have copied the creator of Coin Widget on this email.  Thank you for your time, Evan Teitelman.
