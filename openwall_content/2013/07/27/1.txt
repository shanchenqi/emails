I.   Background  The Network File System (NFS) allows a host to export some or all of its file systems so that other hosts can access them over the network and mount them as if they were on local disks.  FreeBSD includes both server and client implementations of NFS.  II.  Problem Description  The kernel incorrectly uses client supplied credentials instead of the one configured in exports(5) when filling out the anonymous credential for a NFS export, when -network or -host restrictions are used at the same time.  III. Impact  The remote client may supply privileged credentials (e.g. the root user) when accessing a file under the NFS share, which will bypass the normal access checks.  IV.  Workaround  Systems that do not provide the NFS service are not vulnerable.  Systems that do provide the NFS service are only vulnerable when -mapall or -maproot is used in combination with network and/or host restrictions.  V.   Solution  Perform one of the following:  1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.  2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:  The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable FreeBSD release branches.  a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.  # fetch # fetch # gpg --verify nfsserver.patch.asc  b) Apply the patch.  # cd /usr/src # patch < /path/to/patch  c) Recompile your kernel as described in <URL:http://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/kernelconfig.html> and reboot the system.  3) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:  Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the or amd64 platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:  # freebsd-update fetch # freebsd-update install  VI.  Correction details  The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each affected branch.
