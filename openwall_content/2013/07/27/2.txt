I.   Background  BIND 9 is an implementation of the Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. The named(8) daemon is an Internet Domain Name Server.  The libdns library is a library of DNS protocol support functions.  II.  Problem Description  Due to a software defect a specially crafted query which includes malformed rdata, could cause named(8) to crash with an assertion failure and rejecting the malformed query.  This issue affects both recursive and authoritative-only nameservers.  III. Impact  An attacker who can send a specially crafted query could cause named(8) to crash, resulting in a denial of service.  IV.  Workaround  No workaround is available, but systems not running the named(8) service and not using the base system DNS utilities are not affected.  V.   Solution  Perform one of the following:  1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.  2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:  The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable FreeBSD release branches.  a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.  # fetch # fetch # gpg --verify bind.patch.asc  b) Execute the following commands as root:  # cd /usr/src # patch < /path/to/patch  Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as described in <URL:http://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.  Restart the named daemon, or reboot the system.  3) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:  Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the or amd64 platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:  # freebsd-update fetch # freebsd-update install  VI.  Correction details  The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each affected branch.
