Personally speaking, I would strongly oppose membership even if they throw up some security related web pages as it's obvious that this isn't a long term effort but "oh we should join distros@, throw some web pages up? ok, done!" Until a vendor has shown some long term effort to do security properly I suspect letting them onto distros@ would only increase the chances of a leak and devaluing the list in general.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =Caum -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
