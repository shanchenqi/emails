Any tenant is able to show and boot any other tenant's private flavors by guessing a flavor ID. This not only exposes the flavor's name, memory and disk size, swap allocation, VCPU count and similar flavor properties, but potentially allows circumvention of any resource limits enforced through the os-flavor-access:is_public property.  Havana (development branch) fix:  Grizzly fix:  Folsom fix:  Notes: This fix is included in the havana-2 development milestone and will appear in a future release.
