OOM?  I'll recheck, but at first glance this is simple, unshare_userns() populates new_cred which is not freed by bad_unshare_cleanup_fd if create_user_ns() fails. And create_user_ns() _should_ fail (iiuc) when CLONE_NEWUSER is called for the second time and later due to !kuid_has_mapping().  I'll send the patch, but perhaps there is something else. Eric?
