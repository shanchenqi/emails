Based on this Novell/OpenSuSE bug report, I believe OpenSuSE made a typo:  I can't find any info about but the mitre page says it's reserved.  Perhaps that CVE has already been allocated for some other piece of software?  If so, this might cause some confusion.  I'm not sure how this should be handled, but I thought it would be appropriate to point this out.
