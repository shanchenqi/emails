In the above case, since libtiff isnt able to open the file, it returns a NULL, Our "exploit" code above tried to run TIFFGetField() on it, and results in a "fixed value deference",so this is user-mistake and not a vulnerability.  I want to ask to REJECT this CVE.  --  Huzaifa Sidhpurwala / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
