I think this is a  bug in RFC and the fix in NSS is sound, but it could still result  in surprising behavior if the root store is used unfiltered with TLS  implementations that lack this bug fix.  For reference, here is the RFC errata I submitted:  -------------------------------------- Type: Technical Reported by: Florian Weimer <fweimer@...hat.com>  Section:  Original Text -------------     DNS name restrictions are expressed as host.example.com.  Any DNS     name that can be constructed by simply adding zero or more labels to     the left-hand side of the name satisfies the name constraint.  For     example, www.host.example.com would satisfy the constraint but     host1.example.com would not.   Corrected Text -------------- [Add this to the paragraph]      If an implementation extracts DNS names from the subject     distinguished name, DNS name restrictions MUST be applied     to these names as well.   Notes ----- When used with TLS and HTTP (according to RFC section  Name Constraints, is technically a NOP that doesn't constraint the CA  that has this attribute because RFC mandates processing of the  common name attribute in the subject distinguished name.  Consequentially, the constraint can be bypassed by issuing a certificate  without a subject alternative name.  The fix is to apply the DNS name  restrictions to the relevant parts of the subject distinguished name,  too, as implemented here:   --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
