We'll send another message here after we have CVE assignments or another outcome.  Our preference is to assign the CVE IDs after there seems to be agreement among security researchers about how many different vulnerabilities contribute to the problem. Ultimately, the observed problem seems to be:       Several people have reported their BTC stolen ... It has been   noticed that the coins are all transferred in a few hours after a   client improperly signs a transaction by reusing the same random   number.   Here is an example reference that suggests more than one vulnerability:     Other information we are currently considering includes:  and suggest that they are a communication from the "Android Developer Relations team" stating "This was fixed in Android 4.2 when we switched from BouncyCastle to OpenSSL as the underlying crypto provider. I don't know why you'd still be seeing this on Android 4.2."  and refer to "The same k will lead to the same x1 coordinate, which will lead to the same r."  and describe multiple issues in four different products.  And, finally, says "They [ ] claim the problem lies with 'a component of Android'. One of them told me that the solution was to switch from using SecureRandom to reading /dev/urandom directly. The actual source changes appear not to be public, and he wouldn't tell me details about the issue."  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =7Oks -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
