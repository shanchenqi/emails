I've been doing further tests on this exploit, and it turns out it is very hard to exploit; it depends on having a very exact kernel memory layout with a user-mappable address at exactly the right place.  Thus despite the vulnerability being there from 3.2 through I've only been able to exploit it on kernels, which probably limits the  exposure from this bug (it does oops on all kernels, but doesn't call into user code exept on and newer).  Since the bug is now fixed and the exploit seems unlikely to trigger on kernels, I've released my code describing the issue in more  detail.  See my perf_event_tests package:    https://github.com/deater/perf_event_tests  A simple test for the bug can be found under:    crashes/arm_validate_event_oops.c And the exploit (with details in the source code comments) is here:    exploits/arm_perf_exploit.c  Vince  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
