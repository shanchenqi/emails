Probably the best mechanism to track actively-syncing peers is pool.sks-keyservers.net  (*not* sks-keyservers.net on its own).  The various pools in the pool.sks-keyservers.net subzones are well-maintained DNS round-robins.  for more details, see:   http://sks-keyservers.net/overview-of-pools.php  If you want to discuss the keyserver network, the dominant keyserver implementation (SKS) or the DNS pools, the best place to do so is:    SKS development list <sks-devel@...gnu.org>  GnuPG's default keyserver of keys.gnupg.net is now a CNAME for pool.sks-keyservers.net, fwiw.  ---------------  I agree with Moritz Naumann's analysis of the weakness of the postgresql RPM key overall -- a 5.5 year-old DSA key is probably not appropriate for use any more.  If the psql RPM folks are going to do any work to improve this, they're probably better off starting with a new, strong key entirely.  If they want to upgrade their key but don't want to change their documentation at all, they can contact me off-list and i'll help them generate a RSA key that has the matching short keyID, since short keyIDs are trivial to spoof these days :P  	--dkg   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
