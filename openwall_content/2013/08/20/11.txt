In fact, we do this for Debian/Ubuntu already at https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc. The intention was to do it for the rpm keys as well, but that seems to have slipped off the todo list somehow.  Devrim, can you provide the key for this, and update the instructions accordingly? I believe you have the required commit bit on the website repository, but if not, send me the keyfile as it should be, and I can apply it for you (and of course, confirm out of band what the fingerprint is of the correct key).
