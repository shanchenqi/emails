Do you have an idea in mind how to do that in practice? E.g with openssl? Checking name constraints and the logic of verifying server identifiers is at different layers there. Ie openssl makes sure certificate name constraints on subjAltNames are applied but the special interpretation of the CN as host name is left to the applications unfortunately.  An alternative approach would be to disallow that legacy CN interpretation as host name in chains that use name constraints.  cu Ludwig  --    (o_   Ludwig Nussel   //\   V_/_  http://www.suse.de/ SUSE LINUX Products GmbH, GF: Jeff Hawn, Jennifer Guild, Felix ImendĂśrffer, HRB (AG NĂźrnberg)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
