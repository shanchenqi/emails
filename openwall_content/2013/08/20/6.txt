I'm happy to answer, but am not on some of the list's CC'ed, so feel free to pass my reply on. ;)   keys.fedoraproject.org is just recently revived. We had some issues with the sks software that runs on it and it was down for quite some time. Those issues are hopefully solved now so we can bring it up full time.   Hopefully google will notice it once it's been up for a while.   > This actually raises a good point, what are the key > servers now? The big 3 used to be: >  > http://pgp.mit.edu/ > http://keyserver.pgp.com/ > http://sks-keyservers.net/  keys.fedoraproject.org should sync with sks-keyservers.net.  Not sure about the other 2.   kevin -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  AeZZpZZPugIEychcXVL0 =mXzc -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
