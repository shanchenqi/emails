I can't comment on that CVE specifically but on the reserved thing:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures  Description[edit source | editbeta] This is a standardized text description of the issue(s). One common entry is:  ** RESERVED ** This candidate has been reserved by an organization or individual that will use it when announcing a new security problem. When the candidate has been publicized, the details for this candidate will be provided.  This means that the entry number has been reserved by Mitre for an issue or a CNA has reserved the number. So in the case where a CNA requests a block of CVE numbers in advance (e.g. Red Hat currently requests CVEs in blocks of the CVE number will be marked as reserved even though the CVE itself may not be assigned by the CNA for some time.     - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =yTEy -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
