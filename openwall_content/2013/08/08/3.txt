One common entry is:  ** RESERVED ** This candidate has been reserved by an organization or individual that will use it when announcing a new security problem. When the candidate has been publicized, the details for this candidate will be provided.  This means that the entry number has been reserved by Mitre for an issue or a CNA has reserved the number. So in the case where a CNA requests a block of CVE numbers in advance (e.g. Red Hat currently requests CVEs in blocks of the CVE number will be marked as reserved even though the CVE itself may not be assigned by the CNA for some time. Until The CVE is assigned AND Mitre is made aware of it (e.g. the embargo passes and the issue is made public) AND Mitre has researched the issue and written a description of it entries will show up as "** RESERVED **".  Mitre: can we consider changing the text to be more explanatory, I get requests for this constantly (people seem t think I run the database or something ;).  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  iQIcBAEBAgAGBQJSAwCdAAoJEBYNRVNeJnmTdgIP/izRNpjULBIuwKrGmDbEwsHy bR/LbIzhq9TnZs6qWTxr =Jov8 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
