Anyway, couple of security flaws were found by Florian during security review:  * Issue #1: Log file created with insecure (world-writable) permissions      A security flaw was found in the way Trace module of WiMAX, an user space   daemon for the Intel Wireless WiMAX link, used to set permissions   when opening the log file (was created with world-readable / writable   permissions). A local attacker could use this flaw to, in an unauthorized   way, alter the content of WiMAX daemon log file (possibly leading to un-enforced   actions to be performed by system administrator).  * Issue #2: (OSAL crypt module): By setting encrypted password writes unencrypted passwords to log files      A security flaw was found in the way OSAL crypt module of WiMAX, an user   space daemon for the Intel Wireless WiMAX link, used to perform   its internal encrypted password setting action (a failed attempt to set   the encrypted password was logged into the WiMAX's log file with provided   password logged in plaintext form). A local attacker could use this flaw   to obtain sensitive information or conduct unauthorized actions on behalf   of the user setting the encrypted password.  * Issue #3: Supplicant agent ships RSA private key in the package      A security flaw was found in the way supplicant agent of WiMAX,   an user space daemon for the Intel Wireless WiMAX link, used to   manage its private key (private key was shipped together with the source   code). A local attacker could use this flaw to obtain security sensitive   data or, to conduct actions on behalf of private key owner.  * Issue #4:  Three integer overflows, leading to heap-based buffer overflows when handling PDUs for L5 connections      Three cases of integer overflow, leading to heap-based buffer overflow flaw,   were found in the way socket dispatcher and connector modules for L5   connections of WiMAX, an user space daemon for the Intel Wireless   WiMAX link, used to handle certain payload data units (PDUs) for L5   connections. A remote attacker could issue a connection request with   specially-crafted PDU value that, when processed would lead to socket   dispatcher / connector module crash or, potentially, arbitrary code   execution with the privileges of the user running these modules.  There are no patches for these issues yet. They were checked previously privately with Dan Williams and the suggestion was to file public bugs even when there are no patches available for these.  Could you allocate CVE ids for these?
