Only Nova setups making use of the security group extension in Grizzly are affected. Only Cinder setups making use of the backups or volume transfer API extension in Grizzly are affected.  Havana (development branch) fixes: Nova: Cinder:  Grizzly fixes: Nova: Cinder:  Note: The Nova and Cinder Grizzly fixes will be included in the upcoming stable release.
