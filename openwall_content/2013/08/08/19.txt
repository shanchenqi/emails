My understanding would be no.  A follow-up CVE would be assigned if it a) didn't fix the underlying security issue (it does) or b) introduced a new security issue (it doesn't).  Botching the fix so that _functionality_ no longer works would not be grounds for another CVE (although anyone backporting these would surely want the additional fixes).  --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
