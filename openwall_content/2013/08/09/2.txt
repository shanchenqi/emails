Perhaps that CVE has already been allocated for some >other piece of software?  In this specific situation, it happens to be possible for MITRE to arrange for the CVE web site's entry to refer to as the correct identifier. There's a standard wording that we use for this scenario, so the entry will end up looking very similar to this one:     This should be completed on the CVE web site in the coming days. In general, the cve-assign@...re.org address can be used for any reports of a CVE typo in a disclosure. Depending on the exact state and usage of each of the CVEs, sometimes we need to do a multi-vendor typo coordination, and sometimes it's simpler than that.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =l15v -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
