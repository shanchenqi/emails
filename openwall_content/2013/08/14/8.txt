It occurs while mounting a DFS  share wherein the server provides DFS referral names of certain length. The  memory corruption leads to an unresponsive kernel and subsequent crash  resulting in Denial of Service.  An user/program able to mount a file system could use this flaw to crash the  kernel resulting in DoS.
