Problem #2: it redirects to  production.cf.rubygems.org which is on cloudfront so has certificate mismatch, so either users have to accept insecurity, or... well there is no second choice =(.  https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=production.cf.rubygems.org  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =PZMb -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
