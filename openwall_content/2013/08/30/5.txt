Ver 1.9. OSVDB IDs: & Product Websites YingZhi Python Interpreter is a native python development application for the iPad/iPhone. It is available for iOS 4 and above. The product is packaged with its own httpd and ftpd servers. Enabling the local daemons for development by Touching Computer<->This Machine starts up an httpd server and ftpd server, both daemons are bound to device IP not localhost.  httpd server allows upload of arbitrary files to root WWW directory. Browsing to presents an index page in which anyone can upload files to the web servers root directory.  Use Support for anonymous upload is, at least, rare in HTTP servers and this behavior would seem to violate reasonable user expectations.  If you have any further information about the specific statements in OSVDB entry please let us know. For example, have you confirmed that the default configuration of this HTTP server enables a PHP interpreter, such that uploads of .php files are especially dangerous?    I just checked and it appears the http server doesn't interpret .php, .cgi or .py, it only serves basic content.   telnet Trying Connected to Escape character is '^]'.

The file system supports txt, pdf, chm, mp3, zip, gif, png, html, py  I originally thought .py support might have meant the http server interpreted python, but I have not had success in testing this.       ftp server vulnerable to ../ bug The ftp server doesn't sanitize user input and allows remote users to read and possibly write to the devices storage.  Use   The ftp server doesn't bother authenticating users, any username/password combination will allow you in.  We're not immediately assigning a CVE ID for this authentication behavior because it might be an intentional part of the vendor's design, and might have been reasonable in the vendor's envisioned development environment. If there is any documentation suggesting that this is instead an authentication bypass (e.g., the product allows the user to configure a username/password combination), the assignment can of course be reconsidered.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =pgG9 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Content of type "text/html" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
