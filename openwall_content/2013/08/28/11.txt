Just going to cut and paste from our bugzilla:  It was reported [1],[2] that ID-software (libdigidoc):  "Fixed one critical bug in the DDOC parsing routines. By persuading a victim to open a specially-crafted DDOC file, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to overwrite arbitrary files on the system with the privileges of the victim."  The patch is in svn (not the repository from code.google.com/p/esteid, but from svn.eesti.ee) [3] (r98).  This patch was backported for Mageia [4] and looks applicable to what we ship in Fedora (although we have a much older version).  The patch from Mageia (or upstream) won't apply without changes, however, as it's adding a new error code.  Judging from the patch, it's just making sure that the file name doesn't include '/' or '\\' (so no paths in the filename).
