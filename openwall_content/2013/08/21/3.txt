Checking the inode may result in perfectly reasonable behaviour suddenly not working:     my-suid-program > logfile  for instance will fail if the setuid owner doesn't have permission to write to logfile which would surprise a lot of people (and break a lot of things).   Moreover,    my-suid-program | tee logfile >/dev/null  would work.   On the other hand, selinux takes care of both of these: it only forbids the write() when it's wrong will (often) track the write across a pipeline.  jch  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
