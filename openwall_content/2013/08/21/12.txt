Christey" <coley@...re.org> Subject: Kurt go byebye for vacation next week  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1  So I'll be gone next week, no emails due to vacation. In that time Mitre will take over public assignments on OSS-Security. If you need private assignments go email secalert@...hat.com and someone on SRT will take care of you.  Also I'm trying to catch up on CVE assignments, sorry I've let them pile up a bit.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =Td6W -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
