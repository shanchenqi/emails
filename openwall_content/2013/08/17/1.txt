Well, there's a problem with HTTP -> HTTPS transition if it happens during or after user authentication: if a login form resides on a page obtained through HTTP, there's a opportunity for an attacker to steal users' credentials by tampering the page's content during MitM before the transition occurs. Of course you can redirect users to a separate login page over HTTPS, but: - IMHO, if they get used to HTTP and the lack of HTTPS indication during their anonymous experience, then the chances they will check the bar before filling the form may be lower than if they would have been using HTTPS by default. - Some people may consider it much less ergonomic and somewhat contrary to the original look and feel, especially for the Pjax-based sites.
