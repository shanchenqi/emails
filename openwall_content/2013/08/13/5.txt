The dhclient-script in dhcp packages in recent Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions allow administrator to define hook scripts which are sourced by the dhclient-script.  Those hooks can unset environment variables set by dhclient before they are processed by the dhclient-script.  Not sure if other distros may want to add similar mechanism:  http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/dhcp.git/plain/dhclient-script  But as mentioned before, NetworkManager does its own processing and does not use the standard dhclient-script.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
