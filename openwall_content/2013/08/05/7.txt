Where they already requested? (Cc'ing also the security@...cloud.com team, reading from [3] it's not clear if they where already assigned).  But the following might be emphasized (from [3]):  <AnybodyElse> Luigi12_work: I'll release them as soon as possible. Sorry. I'm actually *very* busy with my job. <AnybodyElse> Luigi12_work: that said: the vulnerabilities aren't really severe and only exploitable in some very special and unusuable setups   [2] http://owncloud.org/about/security/advisories/  [3]  Regards, Salvatore  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
