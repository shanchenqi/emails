AFAICS filezilla embedding putty in vulnerable version is used in build for fzsftp. See [3] for the corresponding bugreport for putty itself.  If you fix the vulnerability please also make sure to include the CVE (Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures) id in your changelog entry.  For further information see:  [0] [1] [2] [3]  Please adjust the affected versions in the BTS as needed.  Regards, Salvatore  ==============  Personal comment: it would be great if software embedded other software/code (e.g. libxml2/expat are common ones, as is zlib and other compressors) could be listed in a semi standard fashion in the source code (e.g. maybe an "EMBEDDED.txt" or something?) along with the date/version that was embedded.   - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =LlIe -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
