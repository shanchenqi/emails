Hi Tavis,  Your approach definitely has my support (FWTW), but there are two aspects that surprised me, and are different from bash and FreeBSD's sh:  You named the option nopriv, while bash and FBSD use the name privileged. I think it is likely to confuse people if "bash -o privileged" and "dash -o nopriv" do the same thing, and that it would be better to match bash and give the option a positive name, such as "priv", or perhaps even match them exactly and use "privileged".  In bash and FBSD, after starting with -p, set +p can be used to drop privileges. With your patch, dash accepts set +p, but silently ignores it.  How does something like the attached, to be applied on top of your patch, look?  Cheers, Harald  View attachment "dash-priv-addon.patch" of type "text/x-patch" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
