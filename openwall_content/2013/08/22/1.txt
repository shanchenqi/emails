Corrected:      UTC (stable/9, 9.2-PRERELEASE)                 UTC (releng/9.2,                 UTC (releng/9.1,                 UTC (stable/8, 8.4-STABLE)                 UTC (releng/8.4,                 UTC (releng/8.3, CVE Name:        For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the following sections, please visit <URL:http://security.FreeBSD.org/>.  I.   Background  The SCTP protocol provides reliable, flow-controlled, two-way transmission of data.  It is a message oriented protocol and can support the SOCK_STREAM and SOCK_SEQPACKET abstractions.  The SCTP protocol checks the integrity of messages by validating the state cookie information that is returned from the peer.  II.  Problem Description  When initializing the SCTP state cookie being sent in INIT-ACK chunks, a buffer allocated from the kernel stack is not completely initialized.  III. Impact  Fragments of kernel memory may be included in SCTP packets and transmitted over the network.  For each SCTP session, there are two separate instances in which a 4-byte fragment may be transmitted.  This memory might contain sensitive information, such as portions of the file cache or terminal buffers.  This information might be directly useful, or it might be leveraged to obtain elevated privileges in some way.  For example, a terminal buffer might include an user-entered password.  IV.  Workaround  No workaround is available, but systems not using the SCTP protocol are not vulnerable.  V.   Solution  Perform one of the following:  1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.  2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:  The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable FreeBSD release branches.  a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.  # fetch # fetch # gpg --verify sctp.patch.asc  b) Apply the patch.  # cd /usr/src # patch < /path/to/patch  c) Recompile your kernel as described in <URL:http://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/kernelconfig.html> and reboot the system.  3) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:  Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the or amd64 platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:  # freebsd-update fetch # freebsd-update install  VI.  Correction details  The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each affected branch.
