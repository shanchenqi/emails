The security  implications are unclear.  A straight copy of a long name to a stack  buffer should trigger a crash because it hits the guard page, but even  that could be a problem for daemons.  On the other hand, it's impossible to know for sure that no GCC version  ever lays out the stack in such a way that we end up with a problem.  Multi-threaded programs linking in script interpreters are more exposed  to these problems, too.  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
