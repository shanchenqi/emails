I didn't say HTTPS could make it riskier. And since you seem to put words in my mouth, please, read carefully what you're replying to.  > I'm honestly tired of the "we shouldn't change the status quo of no > security because we might not do the new security perfectly", guess  I didn't mean or say that neither. I objected to calling HTTPS "a good approximation" to content signing. Because:  - It's not. It just doesn't address many problems and risks that content signing does, and that were proven to be statistically (even more) significant in practice.  - When someone calls HTTPS a good approximation to content signing or something like that, expect no other integrity/authenticity checking measures to be implemented. I wonder, are there any major practical examples that prove the contrary? Doesn't seem so.  Besides, content signing isn't perfect or even isn't something new, at all. It has been available for more than a decade. It even has known issues, including unsolved or even unsolvable (in practice) ones. Yet it's much more suitable for the task than HTTPS.  I'm tired of people who propose flawed or inappropriate solutions on the premise of "doing something is better than doing nothing" when at the same time there are better solutions available and practically applicable, many of which are even considered to be common practices.  There are variations of that misguiding fallacy: - "The perfect is the enemy of good" - "Perfection is unreachable"  Except the proposed half-measures are usually not good at all. And their good available alternatives are not perfect. Just like HTTPS is not good as a replacement to content signing, and content signing is by far not perfect yet is reachable (applicable) pretty much.  Sure, it's much easier to just plug HTTPS in and go like "ok, it's good enough". No, it's not. Even statistically - it's not.  > what: you're not going to get any better at this without practise, > when I was in my early 20's O bought a copy of stronghold and an SSL > cert for seifried.org, Thawte had no idea how to sell a certificate to > an individual (as opposed to a company), we compromised on a scan of > my passport (since I had no business papers for it, being that it was > just my name and not a company).

And the only way to find a lot of these  Well, as long as we're talking about HTTPS, I don't see any mistakes that were corrected. It has many flaws, and even though solutions do exist for some of them, it's like no one cares to implement and/or use them. HTTPS is being misused, over-advertised, inappropriately implemented, overcomplicated and in many cases provides false sense of security instead of any due security.  > mistakes is to actually do it.

So I refuse to follow your advise and instead will continue to say against implementing ineffective half-measures and spreading false sense of security. And perhaps it's you, for whom you should "set up a room", where you could speak of behalf of anyone.
