For example, if I want to publish something really interesting for list subscribers (say, an image at http://hren.tebe.ru/noise.png which actually is just a random data), then HTTPS will add nothing except our (and all transit) ISPs wouldn't know what did you really downloaded from that server, but http://hren.tebe.ru/noise.png.sig (or just my note that given file has the size of bytes and its' SHA1 hash is together with this signed message will prove its' integrity.   >>> this would also work for the case where you first use HTTP to  >>> get a redirect to HTTPS  >> The most annoying behavior...

Then protect the data, regardless of the communication channel's protection.  Untrusted channel may deliver valid data, and trusted channel may deliver invalid data. That's the only idea why I've started this subthread.   --  Alexey V.
