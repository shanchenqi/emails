HTTPS should be used only for non-anonymous access, otherwise plain HTTP is preferred. In any case, let the users choose whether they want to use it.  Compare to FTP vs SCP/SFTP: first is for getting files from anyone (into /incoming) and giving files for everyone (from /pub), second is for transferring your own files. Obviously, I presume FTP daemon to be configured for anonymous-only access.   > intercepting and modifying HTTP is trivial.  Yes. But intercepting and modifying HTTPS requires just an ability to issue client-trusted certificates (sufficient for 99% of HTTPS applications), so the content signing should always be preferred over distributor validation.   --  Alexey V.
