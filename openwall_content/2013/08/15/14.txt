[...]  Dragging this back onto the original topic, hopefully, the above concerns are far less relevant for a tool focused on downloading packages from a single site. The gem utility could absolutely pin its validation expectations to a single signing authority or even to a single server certificate (and make it a configurable list to support private package repositories and mirrors where desired). The transport security implications for a system with basically one distribution endpoint offer significantly different solutions than a many-to-many association like Web browsing. --  { PGP( ); FINGER( fungi@...ulhu.yuggoth.org ); WWW( http://fungi.yuggoth.org/ ); IRC( fungi@....yuggoth.org#ccl ); WHOIS( STANL3-ARIN ); MUD( ); }  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
