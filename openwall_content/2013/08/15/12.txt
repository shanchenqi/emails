Some sites are much more evil than interceptors.  #1 is technically true but because there's no way to programmatically determine if a interception or modification is "evil" systems should default to disallow and allow the user to allow it (by trusting another CA for instance for the interceptor).  I don't understand how #2 relates to HTTPS at all, TLS doesn't state anything about the safety of the server you're connecting to only the safety of the transport.   >  >> You do realize HTTPS can be just as "anonymous" (ignoring the >> fact you have the persons IP/time stamp, browser string, etc =) >> as normal HTTP. >  > Yes.

It means you've connected to the right server and no attacker in the middle has modified the data (nor can they see the data). It makes no assertion about if the data the server gave you is correct, it only protects the transport.  >  >> this would also work for the case where you first use HTTP to get >> a redirect to HTTPS >  > The most annoying behavior...

But NEVER force the visitors of your site to use it :-)  Completely disagree.

Just because data is public doesn't mean you don't want to be assured that nobody has modified the data between the server and your computer. It also completely misses the fact that just because data is public it doesn't mean you want third parties to be able to see that you're accessing that data.  >  >> and as an offshoot of these two properties, and the magic of key >> exchanges you can also handle authentication securely, if desired. >  > How many sites do use the HTTPS client certificates for authentication? > My estimation: less than 1%, as most use trivial username + password > over the encrypted connection. >  >  > --  > Alexey V.
