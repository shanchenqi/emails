I'd go one step further and claim that anyone using a setuid program to solve anything is doing it wrong in the first place :-)  > Unfortunately, many set*id executables don't do that: notably, many > su(8) implementations call into PAM (and hence into arbitrary > distribution- or sysadmin-chosen libraries) with a caller-supplied > environment. I think sudo might do the same, but it wasn't clear to me.  That's kind of mandatory. Some pam modules rely on having access to the calling user's environment (pam_xauth or pam_krb5 for example IIRC).  > I asked the PAM mailing list what their security policy is[1] but > haven't seen any reply so far.  I doubt there is any policy. Has PAM evolved at all the last few years?  Wrt su IMHO replacing that setuid binary with an implementation that uses a client/server model (think of a local ssh) is long overdue. su (and sudo) as is just doesn't fit into todays world anymore. The security issues are just one symptom of that.  cu Ludwig  --    (o_   Ludwig Nussel   //\   V_/_  http://www.suse.de/ SUSE LINUX Products GmbH, GF: Jeff Hawn, Jennifer Guild, Felix ImendĂśrffer, HRB (AG NĂźrnberg)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
