Seems like a strong maybe.  I don't think so -- it isn't the shell at fault when a setuid program fails to manage its privileges properly.  Incidentally, I'm curious to know how the vmware-mount problem was discovered. Was it discovered because dash does not have bash's mitigation in place? Or was it discovered via some other mechanism?  Regardless of the answer, it is probably worth using bash's mitigation in dash, but I'm curious if we'll make discovering future bugs in setuid programs more difficult to spot by happenstance by doing so.
