It seems likely that the addressbook group vulnerability could cross privilege boundaries if the "click on this group after creation" action were performed by an administrator who was visiting the addressbook of an unprivileged user.  The other issues were discovered by und3r and affect version At least one of these issues (JavaScript code in the signature) also affects version 1.0-git. There seems to be a dispute about whether this signature issue crosses privilege boundaries. Apparently a user can use the signature issue to attack himself, but there is no discussion of whether an administrator can visit the "identity configuration page" of an unprivileged user, and thereby become a victim of the XSS attack. The signature issue might be interpreted as a regression. Also, there is some indication that all of the issues discovered by und3r might have a root cause of 'This kind of problem is present in all parts where there is the "MCE" editor (or, more specifically, where there is a <textarea> with the CSS class "mce_editor").'  Thus, so far, it seems that we should have one CVE for the addressbook group vulnerability, and one CVE for all of the vulnerabilities discovered by und3r. If anyone has established that the vulnerabilities discovered by und3r don't all have the same affected versions, please let us know. Also, if anyone thinks that the vulnerabilities discovered by und3r were actually the responsibility of a third-party product (such as TinyMCE), please mention that as well.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =WaFU -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
