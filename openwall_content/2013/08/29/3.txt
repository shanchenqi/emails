Specially crafted photo files may trigger a division by zero, an infinite loop, or a null pointer dereference in libraw leading to denial of service in applications using the library. These vulnerabilities appear to originate in dcraw and as such any program or library based on it is affected. To name a few confirmed applications: dcraw, ufraw. Other affected software: shotwell, darktable, and libkdcraw (Qt-style interface to libraw, using embedded copy) which is used by digikam.  Google Picasa apparently uses dcraw/ufraw so it might be affected. dcraw's homepage has a list of applications that possibly still use it: http://cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/  Affected versions of libraw: confirmed: but it is likely that all versions are affected.  (not listing all the other applications as I'm only considering libraw as the piece with CVE relevance, given the fact that it is a library.)  Fixed in: libraw   Specially crafted photo files may trigger a series of conditions in which a null pointer is dereferenced leading to denial of service in applications using the library. These three vulnerabilities are in/related to the 'faster LJPEG decoder', which upstream states was introduced in LibRaw and support for which is going to be dropped in  Affected versions of libraw:  Fixed in: libraw  Patches: Future  (upstream decided to commit all fixes in a single commit. The missing changes in the patch for are the ones that correspond to I.e. patchset is while the patchset is +  Upstream states that there will be backported fixes for the branch but there won't be any new release and "[they] should use branch from github repo".  BCC'ing Dave Coffin, author of dcraw.  I would like to thank upstream, Alex Tutubalin, for his cooperation.
