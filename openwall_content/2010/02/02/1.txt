Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE request - kvm: cat /dev/port in the guest can cause host DoS  The problem is pit_state->channels[] has 3 elements, and pit_ioport_read  uses "addr" as index to pit_get_count, so reads (and  potentially writes) into other data of kvm_kpit_state.  PIT control word (address is write-only, reads are undefined.  Triggering this can cause a general protection fault on the host.
