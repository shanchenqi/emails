Links that point to areas            within the directory tree exported by the server are always            allowed; this parameter controls access only to areas that are            outside the directory tree being exported.             Note that setting this parameter can have a negative effect on your            server performance due to the extra system calls that Samba has to            do in order to perform the link checks.             Default: wide links = yes   This is samba Note the name is wide links, not wide_links.
