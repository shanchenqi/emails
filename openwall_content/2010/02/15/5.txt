Oh well.  Here's what I wrote ("Futon" is the web front end which runs in the browser and served from the same domain as the database itself; the database uses a RESTful interface, meaning predictable URLs):    Due to CSRF issues, Futon cannot use that API.  You really need to   include some sort of token in the URL (or in an HTTP header) which   does not get passed on automatically by the browser.  Right now,   you're relying on HttpOnly support in the browser, which is not   available universally.      You also have a cross-site scripting issue with uploaded document   attachments.  Right now, it is possible to use an inline document   attachment in a POST request for a new document to upload Javascript   to the server, and have it served back to you for execution.  At this   point, the same-origin restrictions do not apply anymore.   Unfortunately, it is a bit difficult to stop browsers from   interpreting crafted blobs as HTML, so I have no good advice to offer   here.  Even if the first issue is addressed, you still have to deal   with Futon users viewing attachments accidentally.  No reaction from the developers so far.  Note that older versions (such as are not affected by this because they apparently lack any authentication whatsoever.  Sorry for this, I would have reported it privately if I had realized that this particular ship had already sailed...
