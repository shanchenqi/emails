Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org>,         Thomas Waldmann <tw-public@....de> Subject: CVE Request -- MoinMoin --  Hi Steve, vendors,     multiple security issues have been reported against different versions of MoinMoin -- complete list here:    [1] http://moinmo.in/SecurityFixes (part moin  Yesterday was released:    [2] http://moinmo.in/  fixing "major security issues in miscellaneous parts of moin":    [3] http://moinmo.in/MoinMoinRelease1.8    [4]   From what I can tell, when mapping [4] to [1] the:    a, "A major security issue was discovered that could affect        all moin versions up to and including For now,        you can avoid the issue by not having any user names in your        superuser list" was fixed.    b, "Exclude (disable) xmlrpc and SyncPages actions" -- this was        'only' disabled -- "Improved package security:        cfg.packagepages_actions_excluded excludes unsafe or otherwise        questionable package actions by default now.".        Though there are xmlrpc related fixes in        "xmlrpc:         * Process attachname in get/putAttachment similarly.         * revertPage: convert pagename to internal representation." --         Thomas are these also security related fixes?     c, " Do not use OpenID auth code" -- not sure about state of this.  Also, Changes file for MoinMoin mentions:    [5]      d, "* Fixed sys.argv security issue." -- not sure, if this is        specific or affects also prior versions of MoinMoin.  Other references:    [6]  Last message in:    [7] suggests only the "superuser list" issue was fixed in and more fixes are about to come -- "<ThomasWaldmann> planned in about 1 or 2 weeks".  Cc-ed Thomas Waldmann on this post, so he can detail what was fixed to know, how many CVE identifiers are needed / sufficient for MoinMoin of version  Thanks && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
