Miller" <Todd.Miller@...rtesan.com> Subject: CVE assignment notification -- -- sudo fails to reset  group permissions if runas_default set  Hi vendors,     1, apologize for separate post (needed to investigate the       issue first).     2, more about sudo "fails to reset group permissions       if runas_default set" issue:        Sudo failed to properly reset group permissions, when       'runas_default' option was used. If a local, unprivileged       user was authorized by sudoers file to perform their       sudo commands under default user account, it could lead       to privilege escalation.  Upstream bug report:    [1]  Upstream patch:    [2] (against v1.6 branch)    [3]  Other references:    [4]  Affected versions:    a, issue tested and confirmed in version, prior v1.6.x       based versions might be also affected. Issue fixed       in upstream version.    b, v1.7.x based versions of sudo are not affected by this       flaw due the differences in the way sudoers file is parsed.  CVE: CVE identifier of has been already assigned to this issue.  Thanks && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team  P.S.: Thanks to Todd C. Miller for pointing me to [2] and sudo        v1.7.x situation clarification.
