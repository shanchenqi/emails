For the record...  This was reported to Novell Bugzilla by our business partner IBM as a beta test bug on our Service Pack SLES 11 SP1, from rcvalle@....  The report contained the Ooops backtrace, caused by runs of the "flail" tool, ( )  I spotted this 1 bug in the actual code though and mailed security@...nel.org to get it fixed ASAP for and our product.  Usually IBM wants to just have their bugs fixed, but this seems to be different in this case. So sorry for not giving credit where credit is due.  That there was an Oops is however a good indicator that memory corruption is also possible.
