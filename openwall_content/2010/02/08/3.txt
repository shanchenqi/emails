In version it is possible to circumvent the security of screen locking functionality by changing the physical monitor configuration.  Details are available in our bugzilla, along with the patch being used by upstream to correct the issue:   We have assigned to this issue.  The code that caused this issue went into gnome-screensaver during the development cycle, but auto-configuration of hotplugged monitors didn't show up until and that is a pre-requisite for triggering the bug, so only is vulnerable.
