Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE request: kernel: NFS DoS related to "automount" symlinks  fix LOOKUP_FOLLOW on automount "symlinks"  "Make sure that automount "symlinks" are followed regardless of  LOOKUP_FOLLOW; it should have no effect on them."  Upstream commit:  Note: + * This is a temporary kludge to deal with "automount" symlinks; proper + * solution is to trigger them on follow_mount(), so that do_lookup() + * would DTRT.  To be killed before  This affects kernels version onwards.
