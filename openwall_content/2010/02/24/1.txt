Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: kernel: execution possible in non-executable mappings in recent 2.6  kernels (SPARC only)   sparc64: Fix sun4u execute bit check in TSB I-TLB load.  TSB I-tlb load code tries to use andcc to check the _PAGE_EXEC_4U bit, but that's bit 12 so it gets sign extended all the way up to bit 63 and the test nearly always passes as a result.  Use sethi to fix the bug.  I'm not requesting a CVE for this as this does not affect any of our  kernels. But just a heads-up for those not aware of this.
