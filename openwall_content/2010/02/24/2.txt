Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: kernel: RTO (Retransmission Timeouts) Remote DoS  "Make sure, that TCP has a nonzero RTT estimation after three-way  handshake. Currently, a listening TCP has a value of 0 for srtt, rttvar  and rto right after the three-way handshake is completed with TCP  timestamps disabled. This will lead to corrupt RTO recalculation and  retransmission flood when RTO is recalculated on backoff reversion as  introduced in "Revert RTO on ICMP destination unreachable" This behaviour can be  provoked by connecting to a server which "responds first" (like SMTP)  and rejecting every packet after the handshake with dest-unreachable,  which will lead to softirq load on the server (up to 30% per socket in  some tests).  Thanks to Ilpo Jarvinen for providing debug patches and to Denys  Fedoryshchenko for reporting and testing.  Reported-by: Denys Fedoryshchenko <denys@...p.net.lb>"  Just a heads-up. Red Hat is not requesting a CVE name for this as it did  not affect any of our supported kernels.
