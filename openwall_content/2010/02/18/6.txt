Being able to crash the system by plugging in a USB device (for example)  is about as easy as the defenestration exploit - i.e. throwing the  computer out the window - so in that case I wouldn't view it as a  vulnerability.  If someone with physical access can read the kernel memory  that's being leaked, if don't already own the box, that seems a little  more like a vulnerability to me.  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
