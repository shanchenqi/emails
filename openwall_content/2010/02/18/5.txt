Hmm.  Or you exploit the desktop user and then wait until he plugs in such a device (ok, kind of a theoretical scenario, lets ignore).   Are we considering "giving desktop local users unintended rights" a security issue or not?  (Hmm, init=/bin/sh booting and pressing reset might come into  play here too. Then we would not consider that.)  Ciao, Marcus  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
