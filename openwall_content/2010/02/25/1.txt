There is a bit of confusion around the description of  This was due to some miscommunication as to whether or not the full extent of the flaw was public, which is why I didn't send a message sooner to explain why it was assigned.  >Name: >Status: Candidate >URL: >Final-Decision: >Interim-Decision: >Modified: >Proposed: >Assigned: >Category: >Reference: MLIST:[scm-commits] rpms/systemtap/devel systemtap-1.1-tighten-server-params.patch, NONE, 1.1 systemtap.spec, >Reference: >Reference: >Reference: >Reference: >Reference: >Reference: >Reference: > >stap-server in SystemTap 1.1 does not properly restrict the value of >the -B (aka BUILD) option, which allows attackers to have an >unspecified impact via vectors associated with executing the make >program, a different vulnerability than  The original fix for was incomplete, as noted in the upstream bug report for the original flaw:   This is still the same root flaw as not a different vulnerability, so we had assigned as a "fix for the incomplete fix of due to the fact has this description:  "stap-server in SystemTap before 1.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in stap command-line arguments in a request."  The original fix secured only the first link (stap server -> stap), but the second link (stap -> make) was not fixed.  The -B option is not the problem so much as an example of the problem.  I think Frank will agree that this is not a new flaw, so the CVE description should be changed to reflect that.  The -B option is not the problem so much as an example of the problem.  Upstream's bug report has links to the two patches that solve the remaining unfixed bits of (#c10).  Thanks, and my apologies for the confusion on this.  --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
