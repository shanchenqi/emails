Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE request - kernel: ip6_dst_lookup_tail() NULL pointer dereference  ipv6: Fix OOPS in ip6_dst_lookup_tail().  This fixes kernel bugzilla "TUN with neighbours: ip6_dst_lookup_tail NULL crash"  dst->neighbour is not necessarily hooked up at this point in the  processing path, so blindly dereferencing it is the wrong thing to do.  This NULL check exists in other similar paths and this case was just an  oversight.  Also fix the completely wrong and confusing indentation here while we're  at it.
