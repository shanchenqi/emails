These IDs are from a Secunia advisory about mikmod: .. ======================================================================  3) Vendor's Description of Software   "Mikmod is a module player and library supporting many formats, including mod, s3m, it, and xm.".  Product Link: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mikmod/  ======================================================================  4) Description of Vulnerability  Secunia Research has discovered some vulnerabilities in libmikmod, which can be exploited by malicious people to potentially compromise a user's system.  1) Three boundary errors in the Impulse Tracker parser when parsing  an instrument containing a column, panning, or pitch envelope with  more than ENVPOINTS (32) points can result in a heap-based buffer  overflow.  2) A boundary error in the Ultratracker parser when parsing a file  with more than UF_MAXCHAN (64) channels can result in a heap-based  buffer overflow.  Successful exploitation may allow arbitrary code execution in the context of the process using the libmikmod library when opening a specially crafted module file.     --   Thomas Biege <thomas@...e.de>, SUSE LINUX, Security Support & Auditing  SUSE LINUX Products GmbH, GF: Markus Rex, HRB (AG Nuernberg) --   Wer aufhoert besser werden zu wollen, hoert auf gut zu sein.                             -- Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
