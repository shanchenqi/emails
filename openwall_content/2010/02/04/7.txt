Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: clarification needed - samba/fuse/ncpfs symlinks   Regarding these bug reports:   It seems that a separate CVE should be assigned for samba, fuse, and  ncpfs, since these are all distinct codebases.  Since the Samba bug report says that Debian assigned to the  Samba part, it looks like two new CVEs are needed, one for fuse and one  for ncpfs.  Am I missing something here?
