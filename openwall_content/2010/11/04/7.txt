It is in the ofa_kernel package, and SUSE ships it e.g. in the "ofed" packages.   The net/rds/ code inside of it is pretty much the same as the Linux kernel module. It also is autoloading with module aliases.  seems to be there up to the latest version after looking at the code (I tried the 1.4 version).  seems to be present in some versions, but not in the latest version. Unverified.   Does this need new CVEs? The projects are different, but the history seems clear and the code basically the same.
