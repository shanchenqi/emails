The point of my post was to generate discussion on a particular class of information leakage and talk about how to address it.  That said, MITRE's website defines an "exposure" (the "E" in "CVE") as follows [1]:  "An information security 'exposure' is a system configuration issue or a mistake in software that allows access to information or capabilities that can be used by a hacker as a stepping-stone into a system or network.  CVE considers a configuration issue or a mistake an exposure if it does not directly allow compromise but could be an important component of a successful attack, and is a violation of a reasonable security policy."   I don't think it's appropriate to use CVEs as a blackmailing tool, and I don't actually think these issues need CVEs.  But claiming that it would be inappropriate to assign them because they're not "security problems" is a bit misguided.  We're not talking about leaking function addresses here - we're talking about leaking the addresses of live kernel data structures, which in my opinion is more of a risk.  -Dan  [1] http://cve.mitre.org/about/terminology.html   On Tue, Nov 23, at AM, Marcus Meissner <meissner@...e.de> wrote: > On Tue, Nov 23, at Yves-Alexis Perez wrote: >> On lun., at Michael Gilbert wrote: >> > Oh, and if you get CVEs assigned, that kind of forces them to fix the >> > problem, right? >> > >> I'm not that sure (there are CVEs for issues considered too small by the >> developers involved, not only in Linux, which are still opened), and I'm >> not sure using CVE system for âblackmailingâ is a good usage for that >> tool. > > CVEs are for security problems.
