One of the reasons I posted this here was that previously, I felt as if I were fighting a one-man, futile battle against the kernel devs.  It's obvious to me that plenty of people not actively involved in kernel development who care about these kinds of security issues, and it's those opinions I want to bring to the table.  -Dan  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
