I think that the only way to support your goal is to make the case that the CVE definition does cover such exposures.  In my opinion it certainly does; although at the lowest possible severity.  The best course of action is to ask for the assignments, and perhaps Steve Christey will clarify.  That's not "blackmail" or anything nefarious, that's simply the proper procedure for disclosing a security-relevant issue.  For those that are against increased CVE assignments due to the inevitable sensational "high bug count journalism", get over it. Realize that the people that do this simply do not recognize the hidden factors at play and the fact that quantity does not equal quality. They're a lost cause.  Oh, and Dan, don't get discouraged so easily.  You're tackling a hard problem (well, a technically straightforward problem, but a hard social problem). You're bound to run into barriers simply due to human nature. If it were easy it would already be done.
