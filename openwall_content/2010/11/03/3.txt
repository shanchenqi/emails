The below post also mentions a heap overflow.  While there is a semantic overflow (17 bytes being copied into a 9-byte buffer), in reality, the object whose member is being overflowed resides in a kernel heap slab cache that includes enough padding that there is no possible corruption.  So, it's a bug but not a vulnerability.
