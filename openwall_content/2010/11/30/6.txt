Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE request: kernel: pipe_fcntl local DoS  "Export 'get_pipe_info()' to other users  And in particular, use it in 'pipe_fcntl()'.  The other pipe functions do not need to use the 'careful' version, since  they are only ever called for things that are already known to be pipes.  The normal read/write/ioctl functions are called through the file  operations structures, so if a file isn't a pipe, they'd never get  called.  But pipe_fcntl() is special, and called directly from the  generic fcntl code, and needs to use the same careful function that the  splice code is using."  In other words, this is a pipe_fcntl local DoS.
