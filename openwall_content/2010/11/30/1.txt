Kernel stack overflow in econet_sendmsg NULL pointer dereference in PF_ECONET Missing check for capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN) in econet SIOCSIFADDR  is interesting because it's a bug class I haven't seen before, although maybe people who have been around longer have. econet_sendmsg() can be made to allocate > bytes on the kernel stack, overflowing the two pages allocated for the stack, and allowing an attacker to clobber the 'struct thread_info', which provides several easy exploit vectors.  Jon Oberheide has done a more detailed writeup about this bug class here:  is mostly interesting because without it, there is no way an unprivileged user can trigger the first two bugs unless an administrator has already configured an econet address somewhere (econet_sendmsg fails quickly if there are no econet addresses configured on the system).
