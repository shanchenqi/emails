Hi, This is regarding the "utf-8 security issue in php", which was discussed on this list[1] >From the php bug[2], it is clear that this issue has been assigned  However yesterday another CVE was assigned to this bug i.e.  The upstream bug report, describes two issues: a. An integer overflow b. flaw in handling ill-formed UTF8 characters.  The integer overflow issue was solved somewhere in year which was however not a complete fix since the ill-formed UTF8 chars., were still not properly validated. The rest of the issues were solved sometime back.  It seems that the integer overflow is not exploitable on its own, you need to couple it with the second issue for the exploit to really work.  Therefore do we really need two CVEs for this issue?
