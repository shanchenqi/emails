Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: kernel panic via futex  Discovered by Tavis Ormandy, the exception fixup code for the  __futex_atomic_op1, __futex_atomic_op2, and  futex_atomic_cmpxchg-_inatomic() macros replaced the LOCK prefix with a  NOP instruction. This can cause the exceptions to not match the  exception table fault fixup. A local, unprivileged user could use this  flaw to cause a denial of service. This is assigned with   Thanks, Eugene --  main(i) { >> (i-1) * && main(++i); }  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
