We see this for example when various PDF CVE ids get shared between xpdf and poppler.  If it's the same flaw, but essentially different code, they need new IDs.  >From what you describe, it sounds like they are the same, as your package is the parent of what upstream currently has.  If you think it needs some though, let me know.
