While many of the sources for YUI imply that there's only one XSS, one of  our CVE analysts observed that the "Affected Files and Patches" section at  the end of makes it clear that three  separate .SWF files are affected, and they are all patched in slightly  different versions.  So, I'm going to REJECT and SPLIT it into the following 3  CVEs:  charts/assets/charts.swf YUI through   uploader/assets/uploader.swf YUI through   swfstore/swfstore.swf YUI through   > * Customised HTML Purifier upgraded to > * Customised phpMyAdmin upgraded to > > These two have no real information I can see.

Generally, we take  the approach of assuming that such changes are related to vulnerabilities  that originate from the third-party package, but sometimes the  vulnerability is in glue code from the main package to the third-party  package, so there are limitations to this assumption.  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
