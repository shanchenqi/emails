This needs a tighter upper bound, since the calculation of total iov_size can overflow, resulting in a small sock_kmalloc() allocation.  This would probably just result in walking off the heap and crashing when calling rds_rdma_pages() with a high count value.  If it somehow doesn't crash here, then memory corruption could occur soon after.  This is closely related to which also concerned various integer overflow and memory corruption issues in rds_cmsg_rdma_args().  In fact, I'd say it's due to an incomplete fix.
