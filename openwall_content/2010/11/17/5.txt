This is already rather boring. Can we keep this about what has a problem that people actually use and would be problematic (at risk) if the software was subject to a man in the middled attack.  I don't know about getmail, but offlineimap also has 'this problem'. See  Really 'the issue' is two fold: 1. there is software which *should* check that the ssl connection is secure but don't even bother to do any kind of checking. (e.g. offlineimap) 2. then is software which attempts to do the checks that the developers thought were sufficient but really were not enough (e.g. bzr, mercurial)  If python blocks these problems in the ssl module and enforces the checks(all of them *that* it should be doing) by default in the various http (and other modules) then we can stop 'guessing' at what may have a problem. I would also like it if python did not have sslv2 enabled by default in the ssl module methods. [0] However, with openssl changing, this will also change afaik.
