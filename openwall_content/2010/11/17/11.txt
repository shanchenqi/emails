Let me add that for an experienced user it should/may be clear that command line arguments may be visible in process list or via the proc fs. The MySQL GUI-tools _and_ mysql command line tool do in fact that they care about sensitive information (eg. user, password, host). But then the GUI does this epic fail calling 'mysql' through an 'xterm -e mysql ...' call. Or some other kind of terminal. This is a kind of stupid.  >  > Cheers, >         Moritz  - --   Martin Drescher  Manfred-von-Richthofen-Strasse  Berlin   80  Mobil: 73  Email:<drescher@...fu.de>  USt-IdNr.
