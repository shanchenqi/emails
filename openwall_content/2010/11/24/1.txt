Great. There's plenty of precedent for CVE assignment to vulnerabilities that leak information that can assist an attacker in exploitation.  In particular, I'm thinking about the handful of ASLR information leaks (eg. [1]), where userspace addresses are leaked via /proc, assisting an attacker in exploiting a vulnerability in a setuid userspace binary.  In this case, we have an analogous situation, except that we're leaking kernel address via /proc, assisting an attacker in exploiting vulnerability in the kernel.  I don't see any reason why it would not be entirely appropriate to assign a CVE here.
