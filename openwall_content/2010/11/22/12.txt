Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: Re: CVE Request: gif2png: command-line buffer overflow  problem   I'm typically uncomfortable assigning CVEs for such issues, since this  makes the distinction between bugs and vulnerabilities even fuzzier than  they already are, and potentially creates a "snowball effect" where  suddenly CVE sets a precedent and inadvertently grants legitimacy to large  numbers of issues that are of very little security concern to most  consumers.  However, when there are common usage scenarios in which the product is  used that produce a vulnerability, these have been given CVEs in the past.  (Non-exploitable browser crashers kind of fall under this reasoning,  because of the common usage scenarios where (1) users will click on links,  and (2) users will have multiple tabs/windows/sessions open, so a  browser-ending crash will affect those sessions.)  That's a long way of saying to use for this issue.  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
