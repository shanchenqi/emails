I don't see why it should be considered unacceptable to require CAP_NET_ADMIN to be able to debug these low-level interfaces. In what scenario would someone attempting to do so not have the ability to elevate privileges on the system they're working on?  Better yet, how is requiring elevated privs actually a real problem for this use case? Your patches don't actually prevent debugging, they just require the user/debugger to get authorization to do so.  Tell the kernel devs that they need to explain why this is a real problem, and that their habitual "no" is not acceptable.  You're doing great, thankless work. Keep on fighting the good fight, and thank you.  Oh, and if you get CVEs assigned, that kind of forces them to fix the problem, right?
