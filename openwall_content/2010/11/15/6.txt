This is a big can of worms CVE-wise, since there can be multiple ways to  fix a single issue.  As a result, I've come to believe that you shouldn't  try to define a vulnerability exclusively in terms of its fix.  In  practice within CVE, if a single fix addresses an already-public CVE-xyz  and a whole bunch of other things, then we (generally) keep the  already-public CVE as is, and assign a new CVE(s) to the "bunch of other  things" that are simultaneously addressed.  For example - in package XYZ, you might have both XSS and SQL injection,  where the XSS is fixed by input validation (say, by ensuring that a  numeric input is actually converted to a number).  This fix will  inadvertently address SQL injection, but a different XSS fix - say, proper  encoding - would not.  This is one of those areas where we can't be completely consistent in CVE,  and the amount of available information directly affects how many CVEs get  assigned.  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
