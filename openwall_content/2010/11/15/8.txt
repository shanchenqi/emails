Maybe Python "should" get the CVE, but the decision to push the issue to  application developers means that those developers will each have to  provide fixes, and software consumers will have to track these related  vulns at the application level.  (One could make the same argument about fundamental design flaws in  standards-based protocols, for which CVE generally assigns a single  identifier, but those issues generally feel "different" to me.  Quite  logical, I know...)  Anyway, I think we need to assign separate CVEs for each affected product  as an instance of "an implementation not working around security-relevant  design limitations of APIs" (which is consistent with the approach that  CVE has taken with respect to the DLL hijacking / insecure library loading  issues of the past couple months.)  I've been tempted to start assigning a single CVE to design limitations  such as this Python certificate issue, and (where needed) independent CVEs  for affected implementations, but I'm not feeling adventurous enough yet.  it kind of goes against the idea where each vuln has only one CVE  associated with it.  So - use for the issue in Mercurial, and feel free to  consult with me privately for the other issues if you wish.  - Steve    On Sun, 14 Nov Marc Deslauriers wrote:  > On Mon, at Josh Bressers wrote: >> Steve, >> >> Can I defer this one to MITRE?
