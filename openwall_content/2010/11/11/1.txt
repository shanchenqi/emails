As you already know, we have released 4 issues in and gained a lot of experiences working on them. For we have some great plans for our readers.  Our main focus for next year is to publish more high quality articles and for that reason, we are now announcing a Call for Articles. =)   TOPICS  Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the following:  * New Attack and Defense Techniques * Reverse Code Engineering * Network Security * Forensics and Incident Response * WLAN, GPS, HAM Radio, Satellite, RFID and Bluetooth Security * Cryptography * Hardware Hacking * Malware Analysis * Lock Picking / Physical Security  HITB Magazine is a deep-knowledge technical magazine. Articles that are more technical or that discuss new and never before seen attack methods are of more interest than a subject that has been covered several times before.
