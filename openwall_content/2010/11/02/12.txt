Duly noted, but I have something to say anyway ;-) From a CVE purist  perspective, successful exploitation gets something more than what you can  get with CAP_NET_RAW alone, thus there is a violation of the intended  security model, no matter how small.  One exception that I sometimes  wonder about is whether you already have chained privileges [1] (e.g.  where legitimate use of privilege A can automatically get you privilege  B), but that kind of thing sometimes makes me wonder why there are 2  separate privileges in the first place.  So, it would be reasonable to have a CVE, even though its severity would  be knocked way down because of the combination of the minor infoleak and  requirements for already-high privileges.  I recognize that this approach is probably at odds with many developers  who have to implement protection mechanisms related to privileges and  access control.  - Steve    [1] where "privilege" is placeholder for "privilege, capability, access,  permission, etc., whatever the term is that is used for the particular  software you have in mind that is an implicit or explicit statement of  what a particular user or group of users is allowed to do."
