This structure is then copied to userland.  It leads to leaking of contents of kernel stack memory.  We have to initialize them to zero.   ===========================================================  net/packet  packet_getname_spkt() doesn't initialize all members of sa_data field of sockaddr struct if strlen(dev->name) < 13.  This structure is then copied to userland.  It leads to leaking of contents of kernel stack memory.  We have to fully fill sa_data with strncpy() instead of strlcpy().   ===========================================================  net/tipc  Structure sockaddr_tipc is copied to userland with padding bytes after "id" field in union field "name" unitialized.  It leads to leaking of contents of kernel stack memory.  We have to initialize them to zero.   ===========================================================  Regards, Jon Oberheide  --  Jon Oberheide <jon@...rheide.org> GnuPG Key: Fingerprint: DA66 6EDD  F47C 17FE  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
