Cite: "Otherwise, it is possible for users to bypass permission settings under the  following circumstances:      * Feeds are enabled     * Any of the posts or topics feeds are enabled     * The unauthorised user - or one of the groups they are a member of - have  forum permissions set on a private forum     * If you have excluded a forum from the list of forums that provide feeds,  it is unaffected"   Also, I think this phpbb still has no cve (I requested that before  here): # [Sec] Only use forum id supplied for posting if global announcement  detected.
