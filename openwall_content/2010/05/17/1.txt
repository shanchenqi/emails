The lwp-download script is shipped along with the libwww-perl library.  Unsafe behaviours have been found in lftp and lwp-download handling the Content-Disposition header in conjunction with the 'suggested filename' functionality.  Additionally, unsafe behaviours have been found in wget and lwp-download in the case of HTTP 3xx redirections during file downloading. The two applications automatically use the URL's filename portion specified in the Location header.  Implicitly trusting the suggested filenames results in a saved file that differs from the expected one according to the URL specified by the user. This can be used by an attacker-controlled server to silently write hidden and/or initialization files under the user's current directory (e.g. .login, .bashrc).  The impact of this vulnerability is increased in the case of lftp/lftpget as the default configuration allows file to be overwritten without prompting the user for confirmation. In the case of lftp the get1 command is affected. This command can be invoked directly by the user from lftp's command line interface or indirectly by using the lftpget script, packaged within the lftp distribution.
