Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Cc: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: Re: CVE request: lxr  Sorry for not making this explicitly clear.  There are three issues:  1.  XSS in the ident parameter, as described in  2.  XSS that is reflected via the search results page after issuing a search.  3.  XSS that is reflected via the <title> tag on the search page, as described in Raphael's original e-mail a few days ago, which Josh just assigned  Bugs 1 and 2 were fixed simultaneously, as indicated in the changelog entry for LXR:   mbox  	* ident, search: Fix for from Dan Rosenberg  	  Avoid a XSS vulnerability  Bug 3 was fixed a few days later on as indicated by:   mbox  	* lib/LXR/Common.pm: Fix XSS exploit in title string  So, while my original intent at the time of disclosure was to have a single CVE identifier assigned to cover all three of these issues, that obviously did not happen.  As it stands, bugs 1 and 3 have their own CVE identifiers, and bug 2 remains unassigned.  -Dan  On Thu, May 6, at PM, Steven M.
