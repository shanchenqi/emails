Another factor is when they are published at the same time.  > Can someone verify what is the policy by the book?  It's never as easy as just a couple rules, unfortunately.  In this case,  has been around for a long time, so it's strongly attached  to *only* the "i" parameter/ident issue.  It's too risky to change the  fundamental meaning of a CVE after it's been published.  (So even though  the intention of Dan's original request may have been to cover other  issues, that's not what it looks like to the public any more.)  Josh assigned for the search page issue, and now Dan has  alluded to a third issue that is neither ident nor search page, but we  don't know what that third issue is.  If Dan's issue is what he calls "a third XSS bug" in  then I'd want a  different CVE for it - since it's addressed in a separate "version" than  the other two XSS bugs.  The crux of the problem here is that the original bug report alluded to  "several" XSS but only listed the ident issue; our CVE description  typically might say "multiple XSS, for example this particular vector,"  but we didn't do that... and neither does the vendor specifically indicate  that the other vaguely-specified issues were actually addressed.  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
