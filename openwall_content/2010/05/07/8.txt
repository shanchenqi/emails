This should probably receive a second CVE.   -Dan  On Fri, May 7, at AM, Josh Bressers <bressers@...hat.com> wrote: > A file contents disclosure flaw was found when gdomap is suid root: > > > > > I assigned to this. > > Thanks. > > -- > Â  Â JB >  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
