Is it possible to assign CVE IDs for these issues as well? It should be noted that these issues I am referring to are PHP issues, not PHP applications.  Additionally, is there anyone who has a contact with upstream about these issues? It would be really helpful to know the state of these issues (whether fixed, wheter in php bugzilla, etc)  [0] http://php-security.org/  Here is a list that I also mailed to bugtraq and full-disclosure in response to Stefan Esser.  > Vulnerabilities in PHP > ---------------------- >  > PHP preg_quote() Interruption Information Leak > Vulnerability - http://bit.ly/cUYsbj > PHP ZEND_SR Opcode Interruption Address Information Leak > Vulnerability - http://bit.ly/bwT28V > PHP ZEND_SL Opcode Interruption Address Information Leak > Vulnerability - http://bit.ly/a3BonY > PHP ZEND_BW_XOR Opcode Interruption Address Information > Leak Vulnerability - http://bit.ly/cdMzTo  Not assigned yet  > PHP sqlite_array_query() Uninitialized Memory Usage > Vulnerability - http://bit.ly/bhHyrj > PHP sqlite_single_query() Uninitialized Memory Usage > Vulnerability - http://bit.ly/8Z8xYt  - (for both issues)  > PHP html_entity_decode() Interruption Information Leak > Vulnerability - http://bit.ly/doxAXk  -  > PHP shm_put_var() Already Freed Resource Access > Vulnerability - http://bit.ly/b4NBD8  -  > PHP chunk_split() Interruption Information Leak > Vulnerability - http://bit.ly/cVoWoM  -  > PHP addcslashes() Interruption Information Leak > Vulnerability - http://bit.ly/b5gkaf  -  > PHP dechunk Filter Signed Comparison Vulnerability - > http://bit.ly/bXDivD  -  > PHP hash_update_file() Already Freed Resource Access > Vulnerability - http://bit.ly/aZDRha  Not assigned yet  Thanks, Eren  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
