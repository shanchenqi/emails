Instead it appends a suffix .1, .2 etc to the newly downloaded file. wget also prints the file name it used. So IMO it's perfectly fine and useful for wget to take the server provided file name by default.  cu Ludwig  --   (o_   Ludwig Nussel  //\     V_/_  http://www.suse.de/ SUSE LINUX Products GmbH, GF: Markus Rex, HRB (AG Nuernberg)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
