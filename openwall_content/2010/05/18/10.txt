Since cloning results in the creation of a duplicate copy owned by the user who performed the cloning operation, this is an information disclosure vulnerability.  -Dan  On Tue, May 18, at AM, Eugene Teo <eugene@...hat.com> wrote: > The existing [btrfs] code would have allowed you to clone a file that was > only open for writing.
