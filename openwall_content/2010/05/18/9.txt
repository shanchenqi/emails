However, the announcement comes from the vendor so we will ultimately call  it an unspecified vuln with unknown impact and attack vectors related to  "forum id" and "global announcement" or some equally useless description.  So this could use a CVE, too.  At worst it's a signal to consumers that  they need to patch, even if the developer isn't clearly explaining why.  Not much different than your typical Linux kernel bug, actually :-/  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
