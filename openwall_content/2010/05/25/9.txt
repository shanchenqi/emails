For Squirrelmail:  Here are some important notes from the slide:         * Default plugin <mail_fetch>, emulates POP3 fetcher with fsockopen()           PHP functions, Post Authentication only             - No verification on IP / PORTS         * You can transform SquirrelMail as a kind of Nmap scanner          This has been assigned by the discoverer.          The danger is that this attack could be used to bypass a firewall.  Let's use for Squirrelmail.   For Horde:          * You can transform a default Horde installation to a kind of           advanced network TCP scanner with banner grabbing, etc          Pre-auth           Let's use for Horde   If anyone has more links or information for these, please pass them along.
