Additionally, we at the Horde project disagree entirely with the   characterization that this is an exploit.  We have specifically warned   users for *at least 7 YEARS* that allowing the test scripts to remain   executable after using them is inadvisable (see    At   a minimum, it is a bit disingenuous for security researchers to   "announce" a exploit that is explicitly mentioned in the documentation   shipped with the software package.  That being said, with framework changes that have already been made in   Horde 4, test scripts are now globally disabled by default, which will   help protect somewhat against lazy administrators.  Until then, for H3   admins simply need to disable/restrict the test scripts as we have   been telling them to do for years.  michael  --  ___________________________________ Michael Slusarz [slusarz@...de.org]   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
