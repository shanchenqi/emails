For Gv there is also the issue with pdf2dsc.ps (and the Debian lenny version with the temporary filei creation stuff), so it needs to be fixed anyway.  Gs's -P- not working (at least for gs_init.ps), is definitly a bug that needs to be fixed.  I personally would also suggest fixing gs to not look in the current directory by default (looking for important stuff in the current directory is really always a bad idea). I guess the problem is how to fix it.  I think (though I am not really sure) a gs that has -P- activated by default would for example break pdf viewing of gv versions to because (I think) -P- also causes files in the current directory can no longer be opened from other postscript files with -dSAFER and the gv versions above only use -dSAFER and not -dDELAYSAFER as it would need for pdf2dsc.ps generated files. (I think -P- already has that effect, even though it has no effect on gs_init.ps).  	Bernhard R.
