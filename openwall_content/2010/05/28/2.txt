This problem may affect fairly old samba version, I've seen the same code / issue in some oldish 3.0.x versions.  The crash is not too reliable though, I've only seen crash on some (recent) versions using stratsec reproducer (you've noticed already their advisory incorrectly labels reproducers and has them mixed-up, right?).  > It seems that 3.3.x is also vulnerable as the same code seems to > exist in this release as well.

NULL deref should only affect 3.5.x, as it occurs in this code, which does not exist in 3.4.x:   On 3.3.x, reproducer causes smbd to follow error code path where smb_panic is called.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
