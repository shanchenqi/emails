Hello,  It seems thath Samba 3.3.x is also vulnerable. I sent a mail to samba-technical list, but I haven't got a reply for 3 days. It would be really helpful if anyone knows the situation of 3.3.x. I am attaching the e-mail and a patch.

It seems that 3.3.x is also vulnerable as the same code seems to exist in this release as well. However, I couldn't see any reference for 3.3.x being vulnerable. I would really appreciate a statement from Samba team as to the status of 3.3.x  Attached is the patch that I made accordingly to the changes committed to GIT repository, and hopefully it fixes the issues.
