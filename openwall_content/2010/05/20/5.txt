Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org>,         oss-security <oss-security@...ts.openwall.com> CC: Tim Bunce <Tim.Bunce@...ox.com>, Rafael Garcia-Suarez <rgs@...sttype.org>,         Tom Lane <tgl@...hat.com> Subject: reject request (dupe of and  description modification request  Hi Steve,     this is due:       a, [1]          This is duplicate CVE identifier for the Perl Safe.pm module flaw,         identifier has been originally assigned to:          [2]       b, [3]          The description of this incorrectly states, it's PostgreSQL issue, but the true         source code base, responsible for this deficiency is Perl's Safe.pm         implementation. The source of this confusion is:         [4]  Attached are advisories from my original posts to vendor-sec channel for all four issues: i, Perl's Safe.pm and below deficiency, when handling     implicit methods:       [5]  ii, PostgreSQL's PL/Perl deficiency, present due dependency / use of      Perl's Safe.pm extension module:        [6]  iii, PostgreSQL's PL/Tcl deficiency by handling autoload():        [7]  iv, Perl's Safe.pm and below deficiency (see attached archive for      more information)        [8]  Flaw history:    1, Red Hat Security Response Team has been notified on with the details       of this issue. Later has been assigned to this (but in that moment       wasn't aware Rafael did already pseudo-published flaw details on his blog:         [9]    2, Later Tim Bunce identified similar deficiency in PostgreSQL's PL/Perl implementation.       identifier has been assigned to this:         [10]     3, Later Tom Lane identified similar deficiency in PostgreSQL's PL/Tcl implementation -- this       is what has been assigned for:         [11]     4, And finally, Tim Bunce and Rafael Garcia-Suarez recognized a yet another deficiency       in Perl's Safe.pm implementation, allowing to bypass the Perl's Safe compartment constrains,       by evaluation of unsafe code, returning returning references to subroutines, whose truly       execution was delayed to happen later, outside of the Safe compartment.         [12]  Have checked today with Tim, there isn't any new perl Safe.pm extension module issue (besides and cases), which would desire a new CVE id is dupe of  Steve, could you please:    a, reject as a duplicate       CVE identifier for and,    b, update description of       so it would reflect the true reason of the flaw, it was originally assigned for.  Hope this clarification is sufficient. In case of any doubt / need of further background information, related with above four issues, please ask.
