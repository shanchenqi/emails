Though the exploits were not given during HITB (?), some friends have recently shown me that they found how both products (Squirrelmail and Horde) might be abused to be transformed, so that they become some kind of nmap scanner (banner grab, port scan, etc). It helps at discovering a remote DMZ, internal LAN, etc, by using those webmails as evil internal nmap proxies.  More info available on the slides of the corporate hackers who found the 0-days : -> Squirrelmail: page 69 (post auth vuln) -> Horde: page 74 (pre auth vuln)  Regards,  M@X  NB: Useful links :  SquirrelMail: http://www.squirrelmail.org (one of the most excellent Webmail / Opensource) Horde: http://www.horde.org (one of the most excellent Webmail Opensource) TEHTRI-Security: http://www.tehtri-security.com (seems to be some kind of corporate hackers group / company ? who found some 0-days recently) HITB: http://conference.hitb.org/ (HITB Security Conferences)   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
