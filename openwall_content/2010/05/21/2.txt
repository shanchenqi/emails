We were only notified just before the presentation   which I have to say didn't impress me personally, as it violates   fairly well established best-practices for reporting security issues.  That said, we don't really consider it a bug.  If the administrator   reads and follows that documentation, their systems are not exposed.    Part of the problem on our end is that the tool being abused needs to   be turned on by default to help configure new sites, but many   administrators also want to leave these tools enabled after the site   is running and simply lock them down through other means (web server   configs, application-level firewalls, etc.).  However, most of those   means are beyond the ability of Horde to detect, so we can't   distinguish between admins who don't read the documentation and admins   that choose other ways of protecting themselves.  We're considering possible features we might add in future versions   that would help make sure things are as secure as possible without   reducing the flexibility we strive for.  As with any software that   exposes your system(s) to the public, the best protection is to read,   understand, and follow the documentation (docs/INSTALL and   docs/SECURITY to be specific here).  As Norm Abram says, "Be sure to read, follow, and understand all of   the safety rules that come with your power tools.  Knowing how to use   your tools safely greatly reduces the risk of personal injury."  Good   advice for woodworkers and IT administrators.  If you have any more concerns, please let us know.  --  Marcus I.
