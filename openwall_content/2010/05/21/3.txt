What they basically assert is, that as an authenticated user using the POP3 fetch mail plugin, you could repeatedly change the POP3 server settings and as such could 'portscan' a remote target.  This seems just as much a vulnerability as that you could use telnet, or fetchmail, or Thunderbird, to be a 'portscanner', as these all have the option to change a remote server address at will. Or that having a shell account at a system is a security vulnerability as you would be able to write a bash script to repeatedly netcat to remote hosts. I don't buy this.  Note that you need to be an authenticated user to do this.
