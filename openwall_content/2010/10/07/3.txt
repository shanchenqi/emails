Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: Re: CVE request, security issues fixed in MySQL   Looks like there were 8 security bugs reported at  not 7.  These all have different affected versions claimed, so each gets a  separate CVE.  - Steve   - incorrect propagation of type errors in evaluation of arguments to extreme-value functions        "create table .. select crashes with when KILL_BAD_DATA is returned"     - The server could crash after materializing a derived table that required a temporary table for grouping.        "user variable assignments crash server when used within query"     Bug - A user-variable assignment expression that is evaluated in a logical expression context can be precalculated in a temporary table for GROUP BY. However, when the expression value is used after creation of the temporary table, it was re-evaluated, not read from the table and a server crash resulted.        "crash with user variables, assignments, joins..."     - Pre-evaluation of LIKE predicates during view preparation could cause a server crash.        "create view cause Assertion failed: 0, file .\item_subselect.cc, line     - GROUP_CONCAT() and WITH ROLLUP together could cause a server crash.        "crash when group_concat and 'with rollup' in prepared statements"        see: [23 Jul Alexey Kopytov  - Queries could cause a server crash if the GREATEST() or LEAST() function had a mixed list of numeric and LONGBLOB arguments, and the result of such a function was processed using an intermediate temporary table.        "crash with longblob and union or update with subquery"     - Queries with nested joins could cause an infinite loop in the server when used from stored procedures and prepared statements.        "Server hangs during JOIN query in stored procedure called twice in a row"    Dahlia, bzr_mysql-6.0-codebase-bugfixing  - The PolyFromWKB() function could crash the server when improper WKB data was passed to the function.        "crash when loading data into geometry function polyfromwkb"      Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
