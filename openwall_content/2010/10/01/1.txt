Pointer value may be controlled by PDF content, hence if pointed to attacker-controlled memory, code execution may be possible via virtual method call.  This should date back to very old xpdf versions.  seems similar to the above one.  Pointer is to the class that has not virtual methods, but may be used to corrupt memory.  This should only affect poppler versions after  array indexing error / underflow.  On platforms where atoi can return negative result, this can allow out-of-array-bounds write. Code appears in old xpdf versions too.  There are few that don't seem worth calling security: - memory leaks - - NULL deref - - infinite/deep recursion - - OOB read - +  I'm not yet sure about these:  Prevents use of random value for PDF object that is not of numeric type as expected.  This patch, however, does not seem to guard against invalid numeric values, so if some random value used due to an incorrect object type can cause crash later, I'd expect malicious numeric value to be able to achieve the same.  Similar to the previous, commit message here does not explicitly mention this addresses any crash.  Commit message does not indicate this is should address any crash.  getPos seems mostly used for error reporting.  Does anyone have any different findings?  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
