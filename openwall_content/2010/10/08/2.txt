An attacker, able to get a carefully-crafted certificate signed by a Certificate Authority could use the certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and potentially confuse Mercurial into accepting it by mistake.  References: [1] [2] [3] Upstream patch: [4]  According to [1] the true reason for this problem is the new python SSL module implementation: [5] [6]  and as stated in: [7]  it should be decision made by application designers, if the subject CN field will be checked despite of the python SSL module implementation.  So could you allocate a CVE identifier for this issue(s)?
