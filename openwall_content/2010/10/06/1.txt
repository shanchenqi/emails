We have a whole bunch of similar patches in Mandriva, just fetch the cooker  source rpm packages and do something like:  rpm -qlp *.src,rpm | grep format  It would be a major task to push that to the upstream projects.  Just checked the ones I fixed (in  $ rpm -qlp /SRPMS/contrib/release/*.rpm /SRPMS/main/release/*.rpm | grep  format_not_a_string_literal_and_no_format_arguments | wc -l  So, at least new CVE assignments there.
