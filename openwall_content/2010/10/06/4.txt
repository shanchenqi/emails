Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: Re: CVE request: multiple kernel stack memory  disclosures   When dealing with findings of this scale, sometimes the best we can do  (within a reasonable amount of time) is to combine things.  Let's consider the general guidelines of "split by vuln type" and "split  by affected version."  Although the severity of each bug may vary, they  all appear to be related to "not initializing re-used memory."  The remaining question is how to determine "affected version."  Ideally  one might like to know the minimum set of affected versions for each bug  (both in 2.6 and 2.4), but this might not be readily available.  We could  then just decide to split things based on which bugs got fixed in which  2.6.x.y release.  If Dan, Eugene, or someone else has that kind of  information (which is painful for me to research as a kernel "outsider"),  then we can group bugs that are fixed in the same 2.6.x.y release, then  assign a single CVE to each group.  We effectively exclude those one-off issues that are already assigned  CVEs.  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
