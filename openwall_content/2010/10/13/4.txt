As stated in:    [1]  the mingw32-curl package is not affected by this issue, as the error is only present in curl command line tool and that tool is not bundled in the final compiled form of mingw32-curl rpm.  So the CVE request applies really only to native systems, using backslash as directory entries delimiter / separator.
