Apparently the bad code has a assert() in front which causes this assertion failure:  $ LD_AUDIT=\$ORIGIN ping Inconsistency detected by ld.so: dl-open.c: dl_open_worker: Assertion `(call_map)->l_name[0] == '\0'' failed! $   If glibc was built with -DNDEBUG the assert() is empty and the code will proceed into the exploitable parts.  Sebastian Krahmer of my team looked at this yesterday and was quite confident that the problematic zone is protected by this assert(). The source code is however quite a labyrinth of c files, headers and macros so we might have missed something.  Andreas Schwab of Redhat has posted candidate patches to fix the problems:  Ciao, Marcus  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
