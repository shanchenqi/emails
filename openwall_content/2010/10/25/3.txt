Dan, thanks for being so diligent about digging up more information!  That couldn't have been easy, let alone fun.  - Steve   ========================================================================   Author: Dan Rosenberg   >  ipc/shm.c (shmctl), reported and fixed by Kees Cook >  Affects >= >= > >  Reference: >     >  ipc/compat.c (compat versions of semctl, shmctl, and msgctl) >  Affects >= > >  ipc/compat_mq (compat versions of mq_open and mq_getsetattr) >  Affects >= > >  Reference: >     ========================================================================   Author: Dan Rosenberg  Due to the high variation in affected kernel versions, most of these are SPLIT.    >TIOCGICOUNT stack leaks:  (see  >  usb/serial/mos*.c >  Fixed in >  Affects >=    >drivers/serial/serial_core.c >Not fixed yet (Alan Cox's fix will be in >Affects >=     >drivers/char/amiserial.c >Not fixed yet (Alan Cox's fix will be in >Affects >= >=    >drivers/char/nozomi.c >Not fixed yet (Alan Cox's fix will be in >Affects >=    >drivers/net/usb/hso.c >Fixed in >Affects >=  Already assigned -   >FBIOGET_VBLANK stack leaks:   >drivers/video/sis/sis_main.c >Fixed in >Affects >=    >drivers/video/ivtv/ivtvfb.c >Not fixed yet (patch has been queued) >Affects >=    >Miscellaneous device ioctl stack leaks:  >Fixed in >Affects >= (hdsp.c), >= (hdspm.c)  These are SPLIT because the affected files are in different versions.  hdsp.c -  hdspm.c -   >drivers/video/via/ioctl.c >Fixed in >Affects >=    >drivers/net/cxgb3/cxgb3_main.c >Fixed in >Affects >=   Already assigned -   >drivers/net/eql.c >Fixed in >Affects >= >=   Already assigned -   >System call stack leak:  >ipc/sem.c >Not fixed yet (patch queued) >Affects >= >=  Presumably the lack of a current patch means this will affect a different version than (ipc/shm.c shmctl), see above.    - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
