The issue has already been reported upstream [2], and a proposed patch is available on [3].  It seems that all GNU libc versions are affected, including derivatives like EGLIBC.  Could we please get a CVE id for this issue?  Thanks, Aurelien  [1] [2] [3]  --  Aurelien Jarno	                        GPG: aurelien@...el32.net                 http://www.aurel32.net  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
