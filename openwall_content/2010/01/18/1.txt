Hi,  We received a bugreport for Evolution from "Francis Provencher for Protek Research Lab's" (protekresearchlab@...oo.ca).  The issue is that if Evolution accesses a malicious POP3 server the latter can by sending an overly long ERR message cause a X11 error (BadAlloc) likely due to a overly wide Message Box and so cause evolution to abort.  The commit in evolution that fixes it: it also checks for utf-8 validity.   I am still undecided whether this is a real security issue or not. On one hand getting rid of this malicious server from evolution might be difficult if it is auto-opened. On the other hand, malicious servers have also other denial of service possibilities (like sending mailheaders).
