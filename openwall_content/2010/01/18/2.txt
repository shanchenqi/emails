I've mailed the BerliOS admins with no reply. I'm wondering if anyone has  any additional details regarding this.  The Apache group had a similar incident some years back, and did an  incredible job of documenting things:  I suspect that given the large number of distributions this will affect,  some sort of coordinated effort may be in order. Unless we are given  evidence to the contrary, I think it must be presumed that source hosted at berlios.de is not secure and needs to be inspected.  This topic was briefly brought up on a Fedora mailing list:  I suspect each distribution will have their own list of sources that need inspection.  Thanks.  --      JB  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
