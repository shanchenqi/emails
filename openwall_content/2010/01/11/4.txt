I did a little testing with a Linux NIS client and a Linux NIS server, also with the same client and a Solaris NIS server. I used tcpdump to look at the network traffic and saw that, when ypcat is called as root, it uses privileged ports. Of course, when called by a non-root user, it only uses non-privileged ports.  It seems that Linux NIS servers as well as Solaris NIS servers expect that the request is sent from a privileged port when someone wants to look at the "secret" maps, so it is not possible for every user to see the encrypted NIS passwords, but only for root. This is still a security risk in an environment where every user can connect his or her own notebook, but that's another problem.
