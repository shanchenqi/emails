We are thinking about informing our maintainers to  check the upstream tarballs. But given the replies in the lwn thread and a  look at git.berlios.de doesn't give the impression so far that anything has  been fixed in a secure manner. I'll keep you updated but so far at least (and  this is my personal opinion) it doesn't look to me like it would be a wise  decision to host files at BerliOS currently and that BerliOS is interested to  do what apache has been done.
