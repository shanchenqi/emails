I defer to Josh on this, but in a series of patches that is referred to as  "mremap/mmap mess" in some linux-kernel subject lines, for which a  specialist like Eugene is not entirely certain about, in which some of the  patches are assembly-level changes for individual architectures, and where  few of the patch diffs make it clear what the underlying problem was - we  could collectively spend a week of labor trying to figure everything out  from a purist CVE perspective, or anchor on a single series of commits  that are hopefully attached to a single kernel RC or minor version  release.  I suspect the latter would be more helpful to the general CVE  consumer community, so my recommendation is for a single CVE, assuming  that all of these patches make it into a single kernel update.  - Steve  P.S. for those with a long memory, the vim issues were different, just  don't ask me how.   > I rated these > > Here are the related links and patch descriptions: > 1) untangling do_mremap(), part 1 > > > 2) do_mremap() untangling, part 2 > > > 3) do_mremap() untangling, part 3 > > > 4) fix checks for expand-in-place mremap > > > 5) fix the arch checks in MREMAP_FIXED case > > > 6) fix pgoff in "have to relocate" case of mremap() > > > 7) kill useless checks in sparc mremap variants > > > 8) file ->get_unmapped_area() shouldn't duplicate work of get_unmapped_area() > > > 9) arm: add arch_mmap_check(), get rid of sys_arm_mremap() > > > 10) Kill ancient crap in compat mmap > > > 11) arch_mmap_check() on > > > 12) Cut hugetlb case early for 32bit on ia64 > > > 13) Unify sys_mmap* > > > 14) fix a struct file leak in do_mmap_pgoff() > > > 15) Take arch_mmap_check() into get_unmapped_area() > > > 16) switch do_brk() to get_unmapped_area() > > > 17) sparc_brk() is not needed anymore > > > 18) Get rid of open-coding in ia64_brk() > > > 19) fix broken aliasing checks for MAP_FIXED on sparc32,mips,arm and sh > > > 20) Add missing alignment check in arch/score sys_mmap() > > > Reference: > > > Thanks, Eugene >  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
