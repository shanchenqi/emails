The kernel allows processes to access the  internal ".reiserfs_priv" directory at the top of a reiserfs filesystem  which is used to store xattrs. Permissions are not enforced in that  tree, so unprivileged users can view and potentially modify the xattrs  on arbitrary files.  CERT/CC (http://www.cert.org/), report ID   Thanks, Eugene  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
