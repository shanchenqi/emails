Accordingly to ClamAV bug it is  possible to crash the daemon with crafted file, which is not the intended  behavior.  I think these can be flagged as vulnerabilities. However, I am not sure if  these are critical issues. Accordingly to secunia, these are highly-critical.  Is there a standard way to classify the vulnerabilities? Do anyone know how  Secunia classifies vulnerabilities?
