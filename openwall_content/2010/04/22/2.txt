Unfortunately merely enabling some checkbox in the UI isn't necessarily sufficient either. If the RADIUS server uses a certificate signed by a public CA one can easily forget to apply additional constraints (e.g. matching subject, common name etc) to restrict acceptable certificates. Failure to set such constraints allows anyone with a valid domain to forge the wireless network and impersonate the RADIUS server. That finding isn't exactly new, yet it's hardly mentioned anywhere. So I've decided to write a paperยน about it.  I've also contacted NetworkManager upstream since NetworkManager's certificate handling is rather limited. Using NetworkManager for WPA2 Enterprise is basically only safe if a private CA is used. It's planned but not a priority for them to improve the situation.  So if you are using WPA2 Enterprise better check your setup.  cu Ludwig  [1]  --   (o_   Ludwig Nussel  //\     V_/_  http://www.suse.de/ SUSE LINUX Products GmbH, GF: Markus Rex, HRB (AG Nuernberg)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
