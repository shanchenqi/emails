I'm sorry. This was a mistake on our part. We had intended to send the information to vendor-sec and coordinate with other potentially affected vendors. Then once a reasonable coordinated time had passed to send it to security@...nel.org as well as oss-security and lkml.  Our standard procedure:  * contact vendor-sec and coordinate with other affected vendors * send the information to the project specific security list * once public send the information to:     * oss-security@...ts.openwall.com     * other appropriate public project list(s)  Mark Hatle Linux Security Incident Lead Wind River Systems  > Hi Hui, >  > Just FYI, oss-security is a public mailing list.
