Petr Pisar discovered a format string bug in wordnet while doing review of wordnet packages in Fedora / RHEL:       We're not treating this as security issue (no good attack vector, fortify source mitigation) and fixing it as a regular bug.  Though as the issue can be triggered in a similar way as and some vendors fixed that one as security, bringing this to attention if anyone wants to use a different approach.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
