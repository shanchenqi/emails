So at first sight, this seemed like a bugfix for a non-existing feature. Looking at it again, it seems worse.  There is not much explanation in the linked bug, so I'm making some assumptions. Correct me if they're wrong. What you can do in irssi, is configure a proxy, and then attempt to connect to an SSL IRC server through that proxy. Unfortunately, irssi currently can't do that, because there is a bug (not a vulnerability) in irssi that in that case makes it send the configured "proxy_string" encrypted in SSL instead of in plain text. This misbehaviour could be used in an akward setup to connect to a proxy that requires SSL, by pretending to connect to an SSL irc server. To do that you would have to enable SSL when connecting to the server, even when it's not an SSL server. By looking at the code, I suspect the patch is about making that setup work without getting certificate checking errors. Is that correct?  Because it's more familiar, maybe it's more clear in the webbrowser equivalent: it is like configuring an http proxy in your browser, without saying that it requires SSL. Then you surf to https://example.com, encrypting your connection to the proxy, but letting the proxy get http://example.com.  It is intended behaviour in irssi that the certificate check fails here. This patch makes that check pass. That means the proxy is kind of always doing a MITM attack. The user is given the impression he is securely connecting to an IRC server, but his actual IRC connection (between proxy and irc server) is plain text.  To me this additional patch looks like a security vulnerability.  Regards,  Wouter.
