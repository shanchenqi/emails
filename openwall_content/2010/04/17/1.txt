This allows useful use of -ssl_verify without   -ssl_cafile/-ssl_capath, using OpenSSL's default trusted CAs.   Call OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms(), may be needed to verify   certs with certain versions of OpenSSL.   network-openssl: Show why a certificate failed validation.   Do not use SSLv2 protocol. From Bazerka.  However, after rolling it out Steve Langasek discovered a bug when connecting to an SSL irc proxy server[1].
