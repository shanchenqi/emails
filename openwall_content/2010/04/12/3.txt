The SSL commit is here:  >From reading the code it really fixes two things.  It fixes the old "does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) field" flaw, plus also verifies that the server being connected to is the one listed in the certificate.  Let's assign these as such: irssi /0 in CN field irssi certificate host validation  The crash bits mentioned in the changelog are very ambiguous. The git tree isn't any more clear than that. There appear to be two crashes, both sound like NULL pointer dereferences that cannot be triggered by an attacker. If I'm wrong, please speak up.  --      JB  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
