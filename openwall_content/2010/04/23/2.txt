The second quarterly HITB eZine (issue has been released! Grab your copies from here:   ===  3 months ago, our newly 'reborn' ezine was a completely new experience to our small team and we didn't expect it to have a lot of followers considering its absence for many years. But to our surprise, we received over 20K downloads just weeks after its re-launch! Despite all this, there are still many things for us to work on and improve upon. Our team is still working hard to make sure our ezine will not only become a resource our readers love to read, but also something they would like to keep. Our promise is that every issue will have something unique to offer. You can be a CSO or a hardcore security geek, we're confident our content offers something for everyone.  For the second issue, all the articles are now in high resolution. We hope by doing this it will increase the quality and and clarity of the materials. In addition, the articles are now organized into their respective sections and the code listings in them have been improved and are now easier to read. Also, a new "Interviews" section has been added and for this issue, we have interviewed two well known experts from France for their thoughts on the state of computer security.  Finally, we are always looking for feedback from our readers. It's very important for us to know how we can improve in terms of content and design. Please feel free to drop us an email if you have some constructive feedback or ideas that will help us to raise the bar even higher.  See you in the summer (Issue will be released at - Amsterdam)   --- Hafez Kamal HITB Crew Hack in The Box (M) Sdn. Bhd.
