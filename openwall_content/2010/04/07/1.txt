An attacker who controls a user account on the target wiki can force the victim to log in as the attacker, via a script on an external website. If the wiki is configured to allow user scripts, say with "$wgAllowUserJs = true" in LocalSettings.php, then the attacker can proceed to mount a phishing-style attack against the victim to obtain their password.  Even without user scripting, this attack is a potential nuisance, and so all public wikis should be upgraded if possible.  Our fix includes a breaking change to the API login action. Any clients using it will need to be updated. We apologise for making such a disruptive change in a minor release, but we feel that security is paramount. ============  Regards, ~reed  [0] [1]  - --  Reed Loden - <reed@...dloden.com>  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =lq2I -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
