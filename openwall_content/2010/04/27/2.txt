And then, its space (which is  gained by find_keyring_by_name()) is broken by accessing the freed  keyring as the available keyring:  1) If the space of the freed keyring is reallocated for other purpose  (ie. filp SLUB), the data of the filp object may be destroyed by the  user of the freed keyring. (SLUB configuration can share the freed space  with other same-size slabs.)  2) If the slab space of the freed keyring is released into the system,  the system panic may happen because accessing the space of the freed  keyring causes the page-fault.  Example: (we can easily confirm this problem if CONFIG_SLUB is "y".) [1] with CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG_ON While we are executing my reproducer (which is attached), we can notice  that the user of the freed keyring breaks its space: - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - # ./reproducer & ... # dmesg ... ============================================================================= BUG key_jar: Poison overwritten [...]  More info:  Thanks, Eugene  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
