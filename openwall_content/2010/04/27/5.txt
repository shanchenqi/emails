I would agree with you if IRC proxies were autoconfigured the way web browser proxies often are; in that case, that would clearly be a MITM problem.  In *this* case, the IRC proxy I'm connecting to has been painstakingly configured to provide SSL-encrypted proxying to the SSL-enforced IRC servers I use, and modulo this bug where any valid certificate might be substituted for my proxy's certificate, was working entirely as expected.  Whether or not irssi "has SSL proxy support", I've been successfully using it with an SSL proxy for several years, precisely as I was intending to use it, with no security vulnerabilities inherent in my setup.  To have this stop working in response to a security update is unacceptable collateral damage - my only options then are to stop using a proxy, stop *securing* my proxy with SSL, or to stop using irssi.  These are not choices I should have to contend with in response to a security update.  --  Steve Langasek                   Give me a lever long enough and a Free OS Debian Developer                   to set it on, and I can move the world.
