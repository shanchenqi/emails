FYI. We use in one of our products. As far as I see from include/linux/tty.h in archive that pgrp member in tty_struct is already converted to "struct pid". I haven't checked the older kernel releases but this issue exists in It would be very helpful if someone checked older kernel releases to correctly determine which releases are vulnerable.
