Instead, the first page was being written beyond its end. This buffer  overflow can cause a kernel panic. Since only the value field in struct  gfs2_quota needs to be updated and it's a 64-bit quantity that doesn't  ever straddle a page boundary by itself, we can seek to the proper page  where this value lies and write to it.  Steps to reproduce:  My colleague will be posting the patch for the upstream kernel soon.
