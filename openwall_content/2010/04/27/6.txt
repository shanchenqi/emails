This allows a local attacker to create a denial of service condition and discloses sensitive information to unprivileged users. This also reduces usability of this software, because one can't run more than one wafp- instances at the same time. This issue can also be leveraged to delete arbitrary files or directories via a symlink attack.  I notified the project: http://code.google.com/p/webapplicationfingerprinter/issues/detail?id=8  Can I get CVE-identifier for this issue?  --- Henri Salo  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
