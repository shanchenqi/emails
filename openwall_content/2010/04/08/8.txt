I've not investigated this to see if it is more than a DoS.  People wanting to fix this may want to more thoroughly look at the patch[1]. After a cursory glance at it, I'm not sure it is enough: 1. it uses:   if (strcmp(ptr, "get ") && strcmp(ptr, "gets ")) {  Why not use something like (*totally* untested):   if (strncmp(ptr, "get ", 5) && strncmp(ptr, "gets ", 5)) {  just in case ptr is not NULL terminated? I haven't checked if this is an actual issue, but it certainly wouldn't hurt. '5' should probably be changed to something more reasonable.  2. As I read the patch, couldn't an attacker send crafted input after the 4 reallocs and then achieve the same thing (a DoS)?. Perhaps this isn't a problem since it limits the object size to 1MB (according to the FAQ [2]).
