Romain Kuntz and I had the same problem for our bugfixes and additional features against UMIP. We ended up maintaining a parallel git tree on umip.org: it provides bug fixes, code simplifications, addditional features ... We also maintain Debian packages and additional trees.  USAGI people have been warned but - just like you - we got no feedback.  >> > I polished the patch to fit in the current commit.  The >> > bugs were not fixed during the two years.  Can someone assign CVE(s)?  FWIW, the two bugs you report have been fixed (along with others if you are interested) in our tree (http://www.umip.org/git/umip.git) for a while:  commit Author: Romain Kuntz <kuntz@...it.u-strasbg.fr> Date:   Sun Oct 25      Additional sanity checks for ND options length  commit Author: Arnaud Ebalard <arno@...isbad.org> Date:   Sat Oct 24      Security fix: Check origin of netlink messages in netlink helpers.          Sending multicast Netlink messages requires some privileges. Sending     unicast ones can be done by common users. Then, this is up to the     receiver to filter incoming messages to verify the origin and     prevent security issues. See for     more information.           As UMIP expects only kernel messages, this patch adds additional     checks where needed to verify the kernel is the emiiter of the     message. Note that this check needs to be done early (before     checking if recvmsg() return value is not 0) to prevent someone     sending us an empty message and returning.          This patch is based on an initial version by Romain.   If you find additional bugs on UMIP, don't hesitate to drop a mail on the Mailing List: http://ml.nautilus6.org/mailman/listinfo/support. It is also available via Gmane (gmane.network.ipv6.nautilus6.general).
