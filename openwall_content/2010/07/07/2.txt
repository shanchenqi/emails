It's highly unlikely that any distro would be tracking this unstable version/branch, so is a CVE really required? If so, Mozilla can assign one from its pool.  I usually deal with getting CVEs assigned for Bugzilla issues, and I just didn't think this one required one... However, maybe I was mistaken in that.  ~reed Mozilla Security Group  - --  Reed Loden - <reed@...dloden.com>  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  pFMAoLBKcbef1hSrDiyeRUm7bTCoCmZY =EhY+ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
