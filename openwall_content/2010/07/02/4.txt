"feature" of SQLite; it bails if you have  too many almost-but-not-really-utf8 chars in a 'like' query. We can  probably add a workaround for that."  So the problem "seems" to be caused by SQLite but should be necessary to see in its manual if there are references about limitations that the developers should respect or something else.
