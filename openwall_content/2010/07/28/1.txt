Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> CC: oss-security <oss-security@...ts.openwall.com> Subject: CVE Request -- KVIrc -- Remote CTCP commands execution via specially-crafted  CTCP parameter  Hi Steve,     user with nickname 'unic0rn' reported:      [1]  a deficiency in the way KVIrc IRC client extracted the "next" CTCP parameter from message pointer. A remote, authenticated attacker, valid KVIrc user, could send a specially-crafted DCC Client-To-Client Protocol (CTCP) message, like:  /ctcp nickname DCC GET\rQUIT\r /ctcp nickname DCC  which could lead to / allow remote (KVIrc) CTCP commands execution. Different vulnerability than    [2] and    [3]  Upstream patch:    [3]  Workaround: (from [1])    /option boolNotifyFailedDccHandshakes 0  References:    [4]  Could you please allocate a CVE id for this?
