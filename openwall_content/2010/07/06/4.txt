However, there does not seem to be a  : CVE for the Session Fixation flaw, so could you possibly assign one for  : it too?  Can we also get a CVE assigned for the other issues I found in  issues.apache.org dating back to CVE covers 73 of the  issues, some much more serious than session fixation in Axis.  On a more serious note, does it have to be posted to Bugtraq or F-D to get  attention here? If you search osvdb.org by reference for  "issues.apache.org", you will see a substantional amount of  vulnerabilities that are higher risk (e.g., auth bypass, XSS, arbitrary  file disclosure, cleartext password disclosure, etc). Consider there were  almost two dozen more vulnerabilities that didn't get added to OSVDB  because the bug reports were too vague, inconclusive and/or the Apache  staff never responded in any fashion to clarify the severity or verify the  report. If we had more time to actually dig into the report / code, they  likely would have been added.   I am not entirely sure why this one is important enough to warrant an  individual request to CVE for assignment, when much more serious issues  exist, some of which are still oustanding last I checked.  If CVE does assign an entry to this, please assign one to OSVDB for  an Apache Wicket Session Fixation issue too.
