Summary =======  Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of software projects. The following security issue has been discovered in Bugzilla:  * In the development snapshot, adding bugs using email_in.pl   or the WebServices Bug.create method would not restrict bugs to   Mandatory or Default groups.  All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible.  Vulnerability Details =====================  Class:       Unauthorized Access to Confidential Information Affects:     3.7, Fixed In:    Description: Bugzilla administrators can set certain groups as being              "mandatory" for when a new bug is filed. (That is, bugs              are always restricted to access by those groups.)              Administrators can also set some groups as "Default",              meaning that if the user makes no selection about groups,              the new bug will be restricted to the groups set as              Default. In the unreleased 3.7 code and development              snapshot, restricting a bug to mandatory or default groups              would not happen when the bug was newly created using the              inbound email interface (email_in.pl) or the "Bug.create"              method in the WebServices interface. This means that these              bugs could be publicly available, when they should have              been restricted to being accessible only to certain              groups.
