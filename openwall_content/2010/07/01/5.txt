(Josh, notice the RHEL one).  For CVE, we will typically cover client-side crashers, although many don't  think those are important enough unless there's evidence of a possibility  of code execution or some broader problem.  For OSS vendors, I have kind  of an unspoken, informal agreement that they might not assign CVEs to  crashers, but we might do so after they get published.  With a library, though, you don't know what that crash is going to affect,  because it depends on what software is using the library - it could be an  image server, web spider, cron job, etc. for which a crash has worse  consequences than just inconvenience.  So, crashers in libraries are  especially deserving of a CVE.  Personally, I also think that any client that can support multiple  "sessions" at the same time should also treat crashers as a security  issue.  e.g. in a web browser, someone may be surfing multiple web pages,  or in an IRC client, particpating in multiple chats.  An attacker from one  "thread" could cause a DoS to all other threads.  Technically, IMO, this  violates a security model in which only the endpoints of a communication  channel have the "privilege" to close that channel... even if it's really  low priority for most people.  - Steve   ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Reference: Reference:  The TIFFYCbCrtoRGB function in LibTIFF and as used in ImageMagick, does not properly handle invalid ReferenceBlackWhite values, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted TIFF image that triggers an array index error, related to "downsampled OJPEG input."   ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Reference: Reference:  The OJPEGPostDecode function in tif_ojpeg.c in LibTIFF and as used in tiff2ps, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and application exit) via a crafted TIFF image, related to "downsampled OJPEG input."   ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference:  The TIFFVStripSize function in tif_strip.c in LibTIFF and makes incorrect calls to the TIFFGetField function, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted TIFF image, related to "downsampled OJPEG input" and possibly related to a compiler optimization that triggers a divide-by-zero error.   ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Reference:  LibTIFF in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 3 on platforms, as used in tiff2rgba, attempts to process image data even when the required compression functionality is not configured, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted TIFF image, related to "downsampled OJPEG input."
