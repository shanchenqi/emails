Thanks Eugene.  After some further looking at this, I'd like to retract the request for a CVE name as premature.  This is not a security issue because the output strings from vzlist are fixed.  So it would need to be compromised in some way (fake binary, etc.) before it could cause any problems for libvirt, at which point you have a bigger problem on your hands.  Since libvirt is calling vzlist with hard-coded parameters as well, it is not feasible to have "garbage" returned that could cause this overflow in libvirt.  Sorry for the noise; please don't assign a CVE name to this issue (bug).
