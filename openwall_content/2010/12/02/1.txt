A remote attacker, with Author-level privilege could use this flaw to conduct SQL injection attacks (gain further access to the site, which should be otherwise prohibited).     References:    [1]    [2]    [3]    [4]  The two XSS issues below are minor, as they need Wordpress administrator to perform the attack, but according to CVE philosophy, the CVE ids should be assigned for them too. But these two opened / left for further discussion:     2), XSS in requesting user credentials in order to connect to the filesystem    References:    [7]    [8]    [9]     3), XSS when deleting a plugin    References:    [10]    [11]    [12]  Note: The other issues mentioned in:                should be only bugfixes.  Steve, could you allocate CVE identifiers for this / these issue / issues?
