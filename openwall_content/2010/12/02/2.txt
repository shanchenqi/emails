When the kernel performs an address limit override via set_fs(KERNEL_DS) and subsequently faults or BUGs before restoring USER_DS, the error path includes calls to put_user() to a user-controlled address.  Calls to put_user() include access_ok() checks on the provided address to ensure it lies in userspace.  However, because of the address limit override, these checks will always pass in this case, allowing the process owner to turn an OOPS into a write to an arbitrary kernel address, which can easily lead to privilege escalation.  This problem requires an additional vulnerability to exploit, but as Nelson points out, it's not too uncommon for such issues to exist. (NULL pointer dereference in Econet) is a recent example that can be triggered under KERNEL_DS and used to escalate privileges via this bug.
