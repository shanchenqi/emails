I remember that). Â If PHP is addressing NULL > byte injection beyond just file_exists(), then that may need a separate CVE.  We fixed it for all file functions.

I hope not :)  Cheers, --  Pierre  @pierrejoye | http://blog.thepimp.net | http://www.libgd.org  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
