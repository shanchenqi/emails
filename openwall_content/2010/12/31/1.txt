Because the provided 'name' argument isn't guaranteed to be NULL terminated at the expected 32 bytes, it's possible to overflow past the end of the last element in the mixer_vols array. Further exploitation can result in an arbitrary kernel write (via subsequent calls to load_mixer_volumes()) leading to privilege escalation, or arbitrary kernel reads via get_mixer_levels().  In addition, the strcmp() may leak bytes beyond the mixer_vols array."   This only affects users who are using OSS (not to be confused with the OSS emulation provided by ALSA), and requires access to a device file normally restricted to users in group audio.  -Dan  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
