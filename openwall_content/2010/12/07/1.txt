IO::Socket::SSL: unexpected fallback to VERIFY_NONE if certificate file(s)  are not specified.  cakephp: code execution via unserialize() call with untrusted data http://malloc.im/CakePHP-unserialize.txt  collectd: DoS via the RRDtool and RRDCacheD plugins  gnash: insecure handling of temp files at build-time  ocrodjvu: insecure handling of temp files  hypermail: XSS  libcloud: "doesn't verify ssl certificate" It appears that what it doesn't verify is the certificate's CN. From the  references provided in the Debian bug report it looks like it is a  widespread issue on the SSL implementations in Python. Not sure how MITRE would like to handle those.  https://github.com/tjfontaine/linode-python/issues/issue/1#issue/1  piwigo: a1) CSRF a2) SQL injection a3) stored XSS (the issues mentioned by the exploit-db entry appear to be the same that  were fixed in b) search.php SQL injection c) CSRF in the admin panel: (the exploit-db entry details two other issues, but are "admin-only" -- feel  free to assign or ignore those.)
