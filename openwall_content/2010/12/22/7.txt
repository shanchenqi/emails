A local attacker    could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code, with the privileges    of the user running the pcscd daemon, via a malicious smart card    with specially-crafted value of its serial number, inserted to    the system USB port.

A local attacker could    use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges    of the user running the pcscd daemon, via a malicious smart    card inserted to the system USB port.     References:    [1]    [2]    [3]    [4]     Upstream changeset:    [5]  Could you allocate CVE ids for these two too?
