I ask the interested parties verify that the fix addresses concerns raised as I would like to make a formal release as soon as possible.  Summary of fix:    mhtxthtml.pl filter modified to reject any message with   nested tags. This is invalid HTML, so any message   that contains it would likely indicate a possible attack.  Whenever a formal, public, announcement of these vulnerabilities are raise, please include link to the MHonArc FAQ that discusses the security risks of HTML mail and how to disable HTML mail in mhonarc archives:    http://www.mhonarc.org/MHonArc/doc/faq/security.html#htmldata   http://www.mhonarc.org/MHonArc/doc/faq/security.html#htmlexchow  This may be useful for users who may not be able to upgrade to the latest release, but need a work-around solution to secure their sites.
