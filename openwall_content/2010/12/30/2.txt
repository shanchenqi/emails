I'm tempted to disable HTML mail support by default rather than try to improve it. What do you think about the idea? What do you think about implementation? The package does not have control over the resource file, so it would probably have to be a code patch.  -Jeff   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
