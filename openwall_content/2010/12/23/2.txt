If an attacker was able to get    a carefully-crafted certificate signed by a    Certificate Authority trusted by OfflineIMAP,    the attacker could use the certificate during a    man-in-the-middle attack and potentially confuse    OfflineIMAP into accepting it by mistake.     References:    [2]    [3]     II), Allows SSLv2 protocol     Description:    In commit:    [4]     when SSL server certificate validation support was added    to OfflineIMAP it was still possible to use SSL v2 protocol    version. Version 2 of SSL protocol version is known    to be prone to multiple deficiencies, each of them    having security implications (to mention some of them):    [5] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer#Security     Thus SSLv2 protocol version should be disabled in OfflineIMAP.

(though opened for discussion of any / none of them worthy of it)  Thanks && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
