The given patch from Sebastian Spaeth has been released in I encourage distribution maintainers who want this fix to either    deploy the RC release as is  or     backport the fix against the last release they own.  I expect to release a new stable soon but I still didn't have feedback from users using SSL. The lack of feedback could mean that    OfflineIMAP users don't expect SSL to work by still refering to the   documentation they know (stating that SSL checks is not supported)  or     they don't hit problems at all.  So, I'll wait a bit more before releasing the next stable.  >   II), Allows SSLv2 protocol >  >   Description: >   In commit: >   [4] >  >   when SSL server certificate validation support was added >   to OfflineIMAP it was still possible to use SSL v2 protocol >   version.

(though opened for > discussion of any / none of them worthy of it)  As the maintainer of OfflineIMAP, I think both issues should have their entry in the CVE List.
