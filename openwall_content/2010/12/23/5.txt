Since I was CC'd, I'm assuming  someone is looking for some historical perspective.  This isn't recent.  OfflineIMAP didn't check the certificate because it  was impossible to do so in Python until Python 2.6; Python's built-in  SSL API (socket.ssl) simply didn't provide any way to do it.  OfflineIMAP's SSL support *significantly* predates Python 2.6 (it has  been in OfflineIMAP since at least  This limitation has been well  and widely documented, both in OfflineIMAP and in Python.  For instance,  at http://docs.python.org/release/2.5/lib/module-socket.html in the  description of ssl:  "Warning: This does not do any certificate verification!"  So if you're going to have a list of vulnerable versions, it probably  goes back all the way to  It is up to you folks whether you want to issue a CVE for it or not.  In my *personal* opinion, it's a little silly; you might as well issue a  CVE on telnet because it is vulnerable to sniffing and MITM attacks.  "Well, yes it is," you might say, "and everybody knows it is, and it's  widely known, so why issue an advisory?"  SSL support in OfflineIMAP  provided some measure of utility to connect to servers that only  accepted SSL connections, as well as some measure of making attacks more  difficult.  It was all that was practical in Python at the time.  But I  don't expect to have a voice on that now, so feel free to ignore my opinion.  That's not to say I was happy with the situation.  I wasn't.  But such  was all that was available.  I have seen patches to address this go across the mailing list, and I'm  sure Nicolas could discuss that better than I at this point, so with  that I'll bow out and leave this discussion of what to do with this to  the people that are involved with the project presently.  - John  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
