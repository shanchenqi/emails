[1]  The release from June was also a security-fix release, for some lesser problems [4]. We suggest that this is the release that is safest for deployment.  We encourage all Exim users to remain up-to-date with Exim releases. The exim-announce list [2] is a low-volume moderated list which announces new releases.  We regret that the full impact of the problem fixed in was not appreciated and that we did not draw more attention to it than the ChangeLog notice "Potential buffer overflow in string_format". With more pro-active notification on our part, vendors who package old releases and backport minimal fixes may have included this fix too.  We expect that the release of Exim will include changes that protect against the privilege escalation seen in the exploit. Some of the changes in behaviour may cause issues in certain configurations and there may be configuration changes required as a result; we take pride in retaining full backwards compatibility of configurations within a major number, but we are prepared to make an exception in this case.  As always, full details of changes will be listed in "NewStuff" and "ChangeLog" and we shall, for the release, explicitly detail what changes in behaviour may cause issues.  We'd like to thank Eugene Bujak for noticing and patching the problem originally and Sergey Kononenko for reporting the active exploit. Thanks are due to Intel, UC Berkeley, Red Hat and Astaro AG for their work to identify the problem exploited and their work on fixes for  This is an update to the earlier notification [3] sent to the exim-dev list.
