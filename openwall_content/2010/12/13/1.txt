My patches assume the max nest depth is 64. Some code in dbus-message.c breaks if a DBusMessage goes over so I'd recommend not going over that. But would be pretty easily possible if desired.  I used "2 * DBUS_MAXIMUM_TYPE_RECURSION_DEPTH" instead of adding a new constant to dbus-protocol.h since that was already the max nesting in a signature if you nested arrays in structs. But maybe it should be a new constant, especially if it isn't 64.  Someone else will need to pick this up tomorrow and get it pushed, but I hope my start on it is helpful.
