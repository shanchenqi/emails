When your release notes indicate "fixed foo" under the heading "Security Enhancements and Fixes", one assumes they are security-relevant, and if they're security-relevant, generally they get CVE names.  >> * Fixed extract() to do not overwrite $GLOBALS and $this when using >> EXTR_OVERWRITE. > >Not sure either if it requires one.  I can't tell because I can't find any information, however if you don't believe this is security-relevant, I won't pursue it.  However, I would question whether or not it is worth listing under "security enhancements and fixes" instead of just "key bug fixes"?  >> Also doesn't seem to be much info on these readily available. >> >> The first seems to be related to this SVN commit (don't see a bug for >> it): >> >> >> >> The second seems to be Windows-specific and is this bug (haven't found >> the SVN commit for it yet): >> >> >> >> The third seems to be 5.2-specific (no mention in the 5.3 changes), but >> I've not yet found the bug or SVN commit. > >In any case I would like to remember you security@....net as well.

I wasn't sure if I had missed some discussion about this or not, so instead of burdening the security team directly, I brought it up here (also under the assumption that others would read the release page notes and see those items listed under security fixes and may have the same questions).
