A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted email message and trick the local user to convert it into HTML format. Subsequent preview of such message might potentially execute arbitrary HTML or scripting code (XSS).  References: [1] [2]  Public PoC: [3]  Further issue note: ------------------- MHonArc properly escapes for example:  <script>alert("elsa");</script> =>  &lt;script&gt;alert(&quot;elsa&quot;);&lt;/script&gt;  But fails to do the same example for a string in the form of:  <scr<body>ipt>alert("elsa");</scr<body>ipt> =>  <script>alert("elsa");</script>  Affected versions: Issue confirmed in latest version  Could you allocate a CVE id for this issue?
