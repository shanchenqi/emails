If not, I can look into it during the holiday break to get a fix for it.  Note, even if there is a fix for the case you provided, there is no guarantee that there could be other data input sequences that get by the filter. Hence, those concerned about security disable the HTML filter:    http://www.mhonarc.org/MHonArc/doc/faq/security.html#htmlexchow  --ewh  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
