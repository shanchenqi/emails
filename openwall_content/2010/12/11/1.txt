So in fact, the bus daemon does crash with a few tens of thousands of nested  variants, at least on (tested Debian D-Bus and Ubuntu D-Bus http://www.remlab.net/op/dbus-variant-recursion.shtml  I already filed the issue as FreeDesktop bug  The issue might also affect other non-libdbus-based implementations but I have  not tested any of those. It might also affect programs that parse 'any' message  recursively such as dbus-send, but again I have not tested that.   I should note that I could not convince libdbus to write a deep enough  message. At about two hundred nested containers, libdbus made the glibc heap  checks abort - probably a separate bug. If run under valgrind then libdbuds  'cleanly' failed to write a message with about nested containers.  --  Rémi Denis-Courmont http://www.remlab.net/  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
