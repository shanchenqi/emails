Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: Exim remote root  A number of sites are reporting an exim remote root based from this report:  Quoting David Woodhouse: "There are two bugs here. First a remote exploit  where the attacker somehow tricks Exim into evaluating data it shouldn't,  and honouring a ${run {/bin/sh...}} directive which ends up giving the  attacker a shell (as user 'exim').  Secondly a privilege escalation where the trusted 'exim' user is able to  tell Exim to use arbitrary config files, in which further ${run ...}  commands will be invoked as root."  The remote vulnerability is still being investigated.  However it is worth  allocating the CVE names now to help with co-ordination.  exim vuln that allows remote code execution as 'exim' exim vuln that allows privilege escalation 'exim' to root  A patch for  Thanks, Mark -- Mark J Cox / Red Hat Security Response  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
