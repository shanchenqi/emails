Attackers can inject boundary of multipart/x-mixed-replace.     It may be able to be used for HTTP Header injection.      It has been fixed in new perl-CGI upstream version via the following commit:     [3]      The Changelog from [3] mentions:     [SECURITY]      1. The MIME boundary in multipart_init is now random         Thanks to Byron Jones, Masahiro Yamada, Reed Loden, and Mark Stosberg       Since perl-CGi is different code base than Bugzilla, we suspect a new CVE id is required      for this issue? Steve, could you please allocate one? (id #1)       2. Further improvements to handling of newlines embedded in header values.         An exception is thrown if header values contain invalid newlines.         Thanks to Michal Zalewski, Max Kanat-Alexander, Yanick Champoux         Lincoln Stein, Frederic Buclin and Mark Stosberg          Chris, Mark, could you please provide more details about the issue? Is it         related to          Steve, could you please allocate CVE id for this? (id #2)     Yet, back to Masahiro mentions in [2], that perl-CGI-Simple is prone    to same deficiency, as in Bugzilla was:    [4]     Looks, like it was already fixed in perl-CGI-Simple too:    [5]     Relevant perl-CGi-Simple patch:    [6]     Steve, could you allocate new CVE id for this issue? (id #3)  Thanks && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team            Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
