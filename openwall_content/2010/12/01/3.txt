Steve, could you please allocate one? (id #1)  CGI.pm is used by the Bugzilla code base. However, Bugzilla may not always be vulnerable to issues in CGI.pm depending on they use it.  >     2.

However, later testing found that the issue wasn't completely fixed in A new patch has been developed, and is currently pending review and acceptance by the primary CGI.pm author, Lincoln Stein.

I submitted a patch, but it has not been applied, as seen in the Network view:  https://github.com/markstos/CGI--Simple/network  However, even the patch I submitted is not fully complete, as it mirrors the state of CGI.pm, and thus also needs further work. Once CGI.pm has a final update to address the remaining header injection issue, I'll share the same patch with CGI::Simple.
