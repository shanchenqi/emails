CERT has a bulletin up regarding a DoS in the getSymbol() function (integer overflow vulnerability):  http://php.net/manual/en/numberformatter.getsymbol.php  Only affects PHP 5.3.x and probably PECL intl >= as those are the only versions with that function.  Does anyone know if a CVE has been assigned to this?  If not, could one be assigned?  --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
