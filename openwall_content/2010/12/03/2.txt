A remote    attacker could create a FIG image with specially-crafted    color definition, and trick the local, unsuspecting    user into opening it, which could lead to xfig executable    crash or, potentially, arbitrary code execution with    the privileges of the user running the executable.     Public PoC:    [2]     Flaw severity note:    On systems with compile time buffer checks (FORTIFY_SOURCE)    feature enabled, the impact of this flaw is mitigated to    be only crash.  Could you allocate CVE id for this?
