Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: Re: CVE request: kernel: CAN information leak, 2nd attempt  I'm ok with this, but I wanted to point out that the previously mentioned heap overflow is a semantic overflow only.  Because the field that is being overflowed is the last field in a struct that is always allocated in a chunk significantly larger than the struct itself, the overflow will never result in any kind of corruption, so it has essentially no security impact.  -Dan  On Mon, Dec 20, at PM, Petr Matousek <pmatouse@...hat.com> wrote: > "The CAN protocol uses the address of a kernel heap object as a proc > filename, revealing information that could be useful during > exploitation." > > Reference: > > > > Credit: Dan Rosenberg > > ------------ > > Please note that there has been one attempt to request CVE for this > issue already [1].
