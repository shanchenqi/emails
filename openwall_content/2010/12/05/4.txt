"Even if the memset is not removed, a compiler could implement 'x.b = 2' by -setting the low byte of a 32-bit register to 2, leaving the high bytes unchanged -storing all 32 bits of the register into memory which would store    nonzero data in the high bytes, possibly containing sensitive information. "  In this case,even after doing a memset the compiler could copy some sensitive  information from the 32 bit register into the padding bytes. So, I feel it is necessary to implement it by copying it to a new equivalent  struct.
