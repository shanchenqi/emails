Personally, I don't see why slabinfo could represent a threat. I'm regularly using it as a normal user just to check where all my RAM is going from time to time. The more we restrict access to harmless information, the more we'll have sudoers in the wild for special users who need special accesses. And sudoers are generally not as well managed as permissions, believe me ;-)  Cheers, Willy   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
