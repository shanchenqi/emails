Re-read some older messages again trying to grok this and it looks like these checks were introduced in so they would _not_ affect earlier versions if I'm understanding correctly.  So only and the second issue without a CVE name affect  So what about previous versions that _don't_ have privilege switching in pam_env and pam_mail?  Would that require yet another CVE or would the addition of privilege switching be considered an enhancement, not a security fix?  --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
