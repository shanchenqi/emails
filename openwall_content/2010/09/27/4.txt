These that are partially fixed are fixed in that git commit you noted previously?   Or are they fixed in different commits?  It looks like they should all be fixed in that commit, but I want to double-check.  Are there patches available to fully fix these issues?  And are there patches for and yet?  I'm assuming also that those issues have always existed although you say 'in but they would affect earlier versions yet, right?  Thanks for any clarification.  I'm trying to wrap my head around this and the impact of these issues.  They all strike me as relatively minor issues, but it is possible that I am missing or misunderstanding something here.  --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
