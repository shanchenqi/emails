As noted elsewhere in this thread, such wildcard handling can be found elsewhere too, with fixes handled as security enhancements, rather than security flaw fixes.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
