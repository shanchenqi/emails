I agree that distros also have to do some homework there, but there are things that we cant just do via init harden scripts. Take /proc/pid/stack. Other files like my prefered friend /proc/net/netlink gives info that allows exploitation-deluxe if you overwrite your socket destructor.  The list I have given was by no means complete (and even didnt mean slabinfo will leak addresses, but was an example of leaking other useful info) and I prefer an inventory of 'problematic' /proc, /sys or whatever files if you speak about inventory of programs using it.   > I know the impulse is to immediately copy what we're doing in  > grsecurity, but the reason we do some of the things in the way we do  Its always my first thought :)  > them is that we can be used on any distro and have no control over  > whatever distro that happens to be.

Sure. It was just a proposal since I felt nobody really cared about the low hanging fruits. It wont make your system rocket proof but it makes some head-scratching for exploit developers which is all you need if you make them stuck in doing that.
