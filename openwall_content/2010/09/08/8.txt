That's true too -- I was just talking about the ones mentioned in the  original post.  /proc/pid/stack goes away when you disable  CONFIG_STACKTRACE btw, but the best solution going forward (as a lot of  these and other infoleaks have been added recently through new features)  is this: the internals of the kernel should be a black box to  unprivileged processes.  This needs to be considered by the people who  write and approve these new features that push out all kinds of  information via /proc and elsewhere.  If it doesn't get considered  before it goes into the kernel, then we have to play this game after the  fact of staying compatible with apps that now depend on that behavior.  > Sure.

Be careful about assuming head-scratching -- if something can be worked  around (like in the kallsyms case), it only takes one person.  Everyone  else can reuse that work without any head-scratching.  -Brad  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
