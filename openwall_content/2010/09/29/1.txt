Although this is a behaviour change, I do not think there is any real case  where an empty item was added in purpose (I even have yet to see one that  uses '.'.) We are therefore considering making this change starting with our next  stable release.  What do the others think about it? do you think you would follow that change  too?  This change has been proposed by some people multiple times along the years,  yet nothing has changed (not even properly discussed, I believe.) Has this  change ever been proposed to glibc upstream? (maybe the RedHat people can  help with this.)   There is a similar issue with $PATH, but we have no plans for it so far  (execvp(8) claims ":/bin:/usr/bin" is the default if $PATH is unset, in some  setups.)
