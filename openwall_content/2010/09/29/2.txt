Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE request - kernel: prevent heap corruption in snd_ctl_new()  Reported by Dan Rosenberg. The snd_ctl_new() function in  sound/core/control.c allocates space for a snd_kcontrol struct by  performing arithmetic operations on a user-provided size without  checking for integer overflow.  If a user provides a large enough size,  an overflow will occur, the allocated chunk will be too small, and a  second user-influenced value will be written repeatedly past the bounds  of this chunk. This code is reachable by unprivileged users who have  permission to open a /dev/snd/controlC* device (on many distros, this is  group "audio") via the SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_ELEM_ADD and  SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_ELEM_REPLACE ioctls.
