OK.  BTW, I think this is not exploitable on current kernels, at least not via RLIMIT_NPROC (it does not apply to fsuid), yet it is desirable to check the return value from such syscalls.  What about the completely missing privilege switching in (the bug found by Sebastian)?  I don't recall if it already had a CVE id assigned or not.
