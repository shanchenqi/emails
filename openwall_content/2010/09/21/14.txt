If there's *no  way* that these API functions can be used safely, then that would be  associated with Rails, and a single CVE could be assigned.  If they *can*  be used safely, but lots of different programmers just screw it up (a la  strcpy() in C), then the individual applications would get their own  separate CVEs.  In this case, while the issue is probably not a problem for the bulk of  Rails programmers, it might be for some - so a single CVE assignment seems  reasonable.  Hope that made sense.  - Steve   On Wed, 22 Sep Michael Koziarski wrote:  > On Wed, Sep 22, at AM, Thomas Biege <thomas@...e.de> wrote: >> I got no answer from the POET paper authors yet but it can be >> that is invalid. > > I'm not sure what the criteria for a CVE is but there's nothing > exploitable here in the vast vast bulk of rails applications. > > It's certainly true that an application using the low level > encrypt/decrypt API is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, but as > you mentioned those apis aren't actually used anywhere within rails > itself. > > Given the 'shoot yourself in the foot' nature of those low level apis, > we'll probably deprecate them as public apis and advise people to use > encrypt_and_sign/decrypt_and_verify instead. > > > >> Cheers >> Thomas >> >> >> Am Dienstag 14 September schrieb Josh Bressers: >>> I've assgiend two.
