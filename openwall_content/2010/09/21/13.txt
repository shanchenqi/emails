I'm not sure what the criteria for a CVE is but there's nothing exploitable here in the vast vast bulk of rails applications.  It's certainly true that an application using the low level encrypt/decrypt API is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, but as you mentioned those apis aren't actually used anywhere within rails itself.  Given the 'shoot yourself in the foot' nature of those low level apis, we'll probably deprecate them as public apis and advise people to use encrypt_and_sign/decrypt_and_verify instead.    > Cheers > Thomas > > > Am Dienstag 14 September schrieb Josh Bressers: >> I've assgiend two.
