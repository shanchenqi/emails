Brad, sorry, I have bad news. glibc sysconf(_SC_ARG_MAX) is implemented by hard coded RLIMIT_STACK/4 heuristics. That said, at least _now_, we can't change this even though you disliked. That said, we can't break userland even though userland library is very crazy.  I don't dislike your "1/Xth of the min(rlimit, TASK_SIZE dependent upon  > personality)" idea. however I think You and Roland haven't agreed this point yet. he seems to want "unlimited" works as "unlimited". then, now I don't make such patch. Instead, I would propose to insert  __vm_enough_memory() check in execve() pass. It prevent almost argv attack.
