The fix has been applied to the library included in MantisBT releases,  and a patch has been submitted upstream for future releases of NuSOAP.  See for further details.  Also included with are another round of XSS fixes to MantisBT,  improved excel export, translation updates, and bug fixes to the SOAP  API, installation, plugin system, and email notifications."   So although it's both xss, one is in mantis itself and one in the  shipped/bundled nusoap, so we should have 2 CVEs.  --  Hanno Bรถck		Blog:		http://www.hboeck.de/ GPG:  http://schokokeks.org - professional webhosting  Download attachment "signature.asc " of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
