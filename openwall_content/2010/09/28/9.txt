Can MITRE take it?  This changelog is too vague to be certain which issues are really about  "security" versus which ones are enhancements or feature additions.  So,  I'll need some help here.  Here are ones that smell like security issues:    * Fixed path normalization to better handle backreferences that extend     above root directories.  Reported by Sogeti/ESEC R&D.    * Fixed failure to match internally set TX variables with regex     (TX:/.../) syntax.    * Fixed failure to log full internal TX variable names and populate     MATCHED_VAR* vars.    * Fixed memory leak in v1 cookie parser.  Reported by Sogeti/ESEC R&D.   Here are ones that *might* be security issues, but it's unclear:    * Fixed nolog,auditlog/noauditlog/nolog controls for disruptive actions.    * Fixed SecUploadFileMode to set the correct mode.    * Trim whitespace around phrases used with @pmFromFile and allow     for both LF and CRLF terminated lines.    * Allow for more robust parsing for multipart header folding.  Reported     by Sogeti/ESEC R&D.    * Reduced default PCRE match limits reducing impact of REDoS on poorly     written regex rules.  Reported by Sogeti/ESEC R&D.    * Do not escape quotes in macro resolution and only escape NUL in     setenv values.   Here are ones that smell like "defense in depth" or "fixing non-security  bug in security feature" or "addition of new 'signature' type" (thus no  CVE):    * Added SecUploadFileLimit to limit the number of uploaded file parts     that will be processed in a multipart POST.  The default is    * Added PCRE match limits (SecPcreMatchLimit/SecPcreMatchLimitRecursion)     to aide in REDoS type attacks.  A rule that goes over the limits will set     TX:MSC_PCRE_LIMITS_EXCEEDED.  It is intended that the next major     release of ModSecurity (2.6.x) will move these flags to a dedicated     collection.    * Enabled PCRE "studying" by default.  This is now a configure-time     option.    * Now support macro expansion in numeric operators (@eq, @ge, @lt, etc.)    * Fixed SecAction not working when CONNECT request method is used     [Ivan Ristic]   - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
