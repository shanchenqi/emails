Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org>, Tom Lane <tgl@...hat.com> Subject: Re: CVE Request -- MySQL -- multiple DoS  flaws   Sorry for the delay...  There are several issues of the same bug type, but based solely on the  "Version" field in the associated MySQL bug IDs, it appears that each  issue has a different set of affected (fixed?) versions.  So these all  wind up being SPLIT from each other.  > 1, Security Fix: After changing the values of the innodb_file_format or >                 innodb_file_per_table configuration parameters, DDL  > statements >                 could cause a server crash. >   References:   >                 >   Reason:       Assertion failure leading to server abort.     > 2, Security Fix: Joins involving a table with a unique SET column could cause >                 a server crash. >   References:   >                 >   Reason:       NULL pointer dereference leading to (temporary) server DoS.     > 3, Security Fix: Incorrect handling of NULL arguments could lead to a crash >                 for IN() or CASE operations when NULL arguments were either >                 passed explicitly as arguments (for IN()) or implicitly >                 generated by the WITH ROLLUP  modifier (for IN() and CASE). >                 >   References:   >                 >   Reason:       NULL pointer dereference leading to (temporary) server DoS.     > 4, Security Fix: A malformed argument to the BINLOG statement could result >                 in Valgrind warnings or a server crash. >   References:   >                 >   Reason:       Use of unassigned memory leading to (temporary) server DoS  > (crash).     > 5, Security Fix: Use of TEMPORARY  InnoDB tables with nullable columns could  > cause >                 a server crash. >   References:   >                 >   Reason:       Assertion failure leading to server abort.     > 6, Security Fix: The server could crash if there were alternate reads from >                 two indexes on a table using the HANDLER interface.  > >   References:   >                 >   Reason:       Assertion failure leading to server abort.     > 7, Security Fix: Using EXPLAIN with queries of the form SELECT ...
