The vulnerability affects the flic file format parser, insufficient restrictions on a writable buffer can be exploited to execute arbitrary code via the heap memory. A specific flic file can be crafted to trigger the vulnerability.  The MPlayer multimedia player is also affected as it statically includes libavcodec, the flic codec can be disabled in codecs.conf configuration file in order to workaround the issue.  Affected version:  libavcodec <= 0.6  MPlayer <= snapshot  Fixed version:  libavcodec >= (see References)  MPlayer >= snapshot  Credit: vulnerability report and PoC code received from Cesar Bernardini <cesar [dot] bernardini [at] gmail [dot] com> and Felipe Felipe Andres Manzano <felipe [dot] andres [dot] manzano [at] gmail [dot] com>.
