You see a lot of vulns with the same type, but many of  them are SPLIT because of different versions.  Some issues have the same  label, but it's pretty clear that they're really talking about different  vuln types that happen to have the same consequence, so they're SPLIT.  When all is said and done, only 2 XSS issues are MERGED in this case.  - Steve    -------------  Multiple XSS (subcomponent #1: Backend)    - fixed: XSS  (subcomponent #1: Backend)    - fixed:    - in Extension manager   ------------- Open Redirection (subcomponent #1: Backend)     - fixed:   ------------- SQL Injection  (subcomponent #1: Backend)     - fixed:   -------------  Arbitrary Code Execution  (subcomponent #1: Backend)    - fixed: or    - Note: CVE calls this "unrestricted file upload"   ------------- Information Disclosure (subcomponent #1: Backend)    - fixed: or    - error message infoleak of path to web root   ------------- Information Disclosure (subcomponent #1: Backend)    - fixed:    - SPLIT: reading contents of arbitrary files by "forging a special      request parameter."  Issue is probably path traversal, thus      different vuln type than "error message infoleak"   ------------- Insecure Randomness  (subcomponent #2: User authentication)    - fixed:   ------------- Spam Abuse (subcomponent #3: Frontend)    - fixed:    - could be same vuln type as "forging a special request" issue in      Backend, but that one is probably path traversal   ------------- Header Injection  (subcomponent #3: Frontend)    - fixed:   ------------- Open Redirection (subcomponent #4: Frontend Login)    - fixed:    - SPLIT: different versions than open redir in Backend   ------------- XSS (subcomponent #4: Frontend Login)    - fixed:    - SPLIT: different versions than XSS in Backend   ------------- Insecure Randomness  (subcomponent #4: Frontend Login)    - fixed:    - SPLIT: different versions than insecure randomness in User authentication   ------------- Broken Authentication and Session Management (subcomponent #5: Install Tool)    - fixed:    - Note: CVE calls this session fixation   ------------- XSS (subcomponent #6: FLUID Templating Engine)    - fixed:    - SPLIT: different versions than XSS in Backend and Frontend Login   ------------- Information Disclosure  (subcomponent #7: Mailing API)    - fixed:    - SPLIT: different 'type' of Information Disclosure than others   ------------- XSS (subcomponent #8: Introduction Package)    - fixed:    - SPLIT: different versions than XSS in other components   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
