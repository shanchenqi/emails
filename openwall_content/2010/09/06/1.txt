These are not backward compatible, and so only apply to new filesystems.  Issue (3) is not directly addressed.  A workaround is to enable per-block MAC headers, or per-block random bytes.  A patch going into allows per-block random bytes to be configured independently of MAC headers.  It would be possible to change the default settings such that per-block random bytes are always used.  Adding new encryption modes is not planned for encfs 1.x.  regards, Valient     Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
