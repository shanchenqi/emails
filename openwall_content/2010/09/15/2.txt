Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org>, jeffm@...e.com Subject: Re: CVE request: kernel: numerous infoleaks  Jeff Mahoney correctly pointed out that the first case (drivers/net/tulip/de4x5.c) is not a security issue because the copied data is from a union, not a struct.  I've gone through these again to confirm that the remaining three are actually security issues.  Therefore, should be marked as invalid.  -Dan  On Tue, Sep 14, at PM, Josh Bressers <bressers@...hat.com> wrote: > ----- "Eugene Teo" <eugene@...hat.com> wrote: > >> Reported by Dan Rosenberg, >> >> drivers/net/tulip/de4x5.c: reading uninitialized stack memory >> >> > > > >> >> drivers/net/cxgb3/cxgb3_main.c reading uninitialized stack memory >> >> introduced in >> > > > >> >> drivers/net/eql.c: reading uninitialized stack memory >> >> > > > >> >> drivers/net/usb/hso.c: reading uninitialized memory >> >> introduced in >> >> > > > > Thanks. > > -- > Â  Â JB >  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
