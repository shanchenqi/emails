Any specific reason to only give CVE to epiphany if you want to start giving CVEs for this kind of flaw?  IIRC, not long ago, no WebKitGtk-based browser I tried verified server SSL certificates and all connected without any complaint or indication that SSL certificate was not verified.  None seemed to offer any configuration option to enable certificate checking.  I guess there may be / was some limitations on WebKitGtk side that can explain this.  I noticed midori now uses different address bar background color, which seem to be similar to the epiphany fix described in the Debian bug.  Oh, now I see you're probably asking for CVE for behavior, not right?  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
