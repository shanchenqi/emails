Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: Re: CVE request: epiphany not checking ssl certs   If an application does not advertise a security feature, then in general  we will not give a CVE because of its absence of the feature (I don't want  to give out CVEs for every protocol that does cleartext  transmission... or uses DES... etc.)  Similarly, we generally avoid  assigning CVEs to "defense in depth" fixes, although the line between  "vulnerability" and "defense in depth" can get fuzzy.  The title says  "Does not longer check certificates" which could be interpreted to mean  that it used to check certs, and now it doesn't.  If that's the case, then  it makes sense to assign a CVE.  - Steve   On Fri, 17 Sep Tomas Hoger wrote:  > On Fri, 17 Sep Hanno Bรถck wrote: > >> >> >> >> Did this get a CVE yet? > > Any specific reason to only give CVE to epiphany if you want to start > giving CVEs for this kind of flaw?
