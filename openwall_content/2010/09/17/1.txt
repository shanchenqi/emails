[1] 2) SQL injection [2] 3) XSS [2]  2) and 3) are from so I guess we are going to need some help from  Steven for those ones. The only information about those is [3] which has  some other changes.  It also appears to be using PHP_SELF in some places, so that's another XSS  vector. Will confirm it later.  [1] [2] [3]  Cheers, --  Raphael Geissert - Debian Developer www.debian.org - get.debian.net    Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
