That being said, it *might* be acceptable to obfuscate the kernel-side addresses.  Still print them, but they're all zeroes.  I doubt if many tools at all are actually using those.  Perhaps a runtime knob which obfuscates those addresses for unprivileged users, something like that.  That also being said, I'm not seeing any kernel-side addresses in slabinfo or zoneinfo anyway and I believe some distros already hide kallsyms.  More specificity is needed.
