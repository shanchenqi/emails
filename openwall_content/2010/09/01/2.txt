Description (from [1]):      It was possible to conduct a XSS attack using error messages in PHP backtrace.     Affected versions (from [1]):    For 3.x: versions before are affected.    Branch is not affected by this     Upstream commit:     phpMyAdmin upstream seems to reference as CVE id to this flaw.  But was previously assigned to: [2] [3] [4]  which affected both (from [4]): For versions before are affected. For 3.x: versions before are affected.  so this is different issue and new CVE id should be allocated (due different affected versions).  Could you please allocate one?
