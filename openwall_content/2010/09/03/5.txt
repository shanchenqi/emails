Yes, it's a security bug that isn't yet fixed in a released version of Firefox. As such, it is restricted until at some point after the release has been made and most users have upgraded.  If you (as a @debian.org person) require access to the bug for the purpose of coordinating security releases, please contact Moritz Muehlenhoff, as he represents Debian on the Mozilla Security Group.
