If an attacker is able to get a carefully-crafted certificate,       signed by a Certificate Authority trusted by Firefox, the attacker       could use the certificate during the man-in-the-middle attack and       potentially confuse Firefox into accepting it by mistake. Different       vulnerability than        References:       [1]       [2]      2, Qt software toolkit (QSslSocket) handled wildcard (*) character       in the Common Name field of a digital certificate.       If an attacker is able to get a carefully-crafted certificate,       signed by a Certificate Authority trusted by Konqueror / Arora web browsers,       the attacker could use the certificate during the man-in-the-middle attack       and potentially confuse Konqueror / Arora into accepting it by mistake.       Different vulnerability than        References:      [3]      [4]  Yet, in [1] Richard and Simon mention: "27 August  At the time of writing the NSS (Firefox) and Qt repositories                   both contain fixes for this issue that will be included in                   their releases."  so it is possible these two flaws already got their CVE identifiers. But if not, could you please allocate them?
