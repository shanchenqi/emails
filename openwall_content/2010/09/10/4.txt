That probably makes sense.  Note that cred_guard_mutex is also overloaded for ptrace_attach, so this would add some more serialization of attaches to threads in the same group.  But as long as actual attachment serializes on tasklist_lock anyway, it doesn't make a material difference.  (Even without that, it would presumably be the same debugger attaching serially to threads in the same group, so it wouldn't degrade anything in practice.)
