Hmm... Probably my poor english leaded to misunderstood. I didn't intent glibc is very crazy. I only intended to "even if userland is crazy, I disagree to break userland".  And yes, we obviously need to expose ARG_MAX limit to libc. a duplicated heuristic code easily makes confusion and mistake. nobody want such  fragile state. however, it's a bit offtopic. anyway.
