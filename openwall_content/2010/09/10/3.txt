I'm sorry you think it's "very crazy" to implement the required functionality in the only way available.  POSIX requires that execve fail with E2BIG when the ARG_MAX limit is exceeded.  sysconf has to return the correct actual limit that execve will enforce so that a conforming application knows how much it can safely attempt to use. Since the kernel uses the hard-coded RLIMIT_STACK/4 heuristic and does not expose the true manifest limit any other way, sysconf has to parallel the kernel's calculation.
