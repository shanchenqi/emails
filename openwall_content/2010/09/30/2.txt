Hey Everyone, 	We just discovered that ocfs2 could walk off the end of fast symlinks -- that is, symlinks that are stored directly in the inode block.  ocfs2 terminates these with NUL characters, but a disk corruption or an attacker with direct access to the ocfs2 disk could overwrite the NUL.  Following the symlink via the filesystem would walk off the end of the in-memory block buffer.  We're not sure how exploitable this is, but I figured I'd provide a heads-up.  The fix is in ocfs2's git tree and will be sent upstream tonight.  Erratas with the fix are being built. 	If someone thinks we should have a CVE, please provide me with the number.  Otherwise, just FYI.  Joel  --   Life's Little Instruction Book  	"Lie on your back and look at the stars."
