We did try some other openssl based apps but most had either no wildcard support, no real CN validation, or wildcard support that use the old-style shell-globs which is much worse anyway. Unlike NSS openssl doesn't provide a function for performing CN validation which means that apps have generally rolled their own (poor) implementations.
