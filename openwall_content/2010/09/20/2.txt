Looking at what we have on our Distros I found three different kinds of behavior: 1) epiphany with mozilla engine raises a popup window if the    certificate cant't be verified. The status bar displays a broken    lock icon if one chooses to continue anyways. 2) epiphany changes address bar color, displays a lock icon and    connects just fine even if it can't verify certificates. The code    simply uses a strcmp for 'https' as trigger. 3) epiphany shows the broken lock icon as described in the    debian bug report  While the modest security indicators of 3) are probably not the most smartest way to tell the user about a potential problem the real danger is 2). That version of epiphany really is broken. If a program doesn't implement the necessary checks it should at the very least not display common https security indicators either.  cu Ludwig  --   (o_   Ludwig Nussel  //\     V_/_  http://www.suse.de/ SUSE LINUX Products GmbH, GF: Markus Rex, HRB (AG Nuernberg)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
