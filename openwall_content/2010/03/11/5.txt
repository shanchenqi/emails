I'm half way down this discussion and already I'd prefer to  stick needless in my eyes.  So far though consensus seems to be RFC  rules for wildcards.  I notice some of the test patterns suggested would  not work in libESMTP as it stands. >    >> Is it the case that for STARTTLS in SMTP what we are really interested  >> in is encrypting the data on the wire and authentication is only of  >> secondary importance? >>      > > Encryption without authentication makes you prone to MITM. >    Indeed. >    >> Do we know what the best current practice is  >> among CAs when it comes to issuing certificates for STARTTLS? >>      > > The most common implementation is to just allow the simple form > *.something so I'd assume that other patterns are rare in the wild. > The last commenter in the aforementioned Mozilla bug says that > *.*.appspot.com is actually used by Google though. > > Anyways, the matching function in libesmtp certainly is good enough. > I was just surprised that wildcards at the right hand side are > allowed. What about the actual patch I sent though? :-) >    I'm happy that the patch jumps through the right hoops though I'm rather  out of touch with the OpenSSL APIs these days so there is a certain  element of trust here :-)  However I did realise there is another problem with the wildcard match.   Currently match_component() just steps over text when it sees the '*',  however it should really be like a character class i.e. the RE  '[-A-Za-z0-9]*'.  Currently * will match any old junk in the hostname  including punctuation and control codes which gives a possibility of  attacking a system using specially crafted hostnames.  I shall modify  match_component() to deal with this and other issues that may be  relevant, after I've waded through the rest of the mozilla thread. > cu > Ludwig > >    Rergards Brian  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
