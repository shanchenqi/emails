RFCs (IMAP), (NNTP) and (LDAP) restrict wildcards to the leftmost component. The LDAP one doesn't allow wildcards in CN's though and none of them explicitly disallows use of the CN if a subjAltname is present. RFC (SMTP) doesn't tell how matching should be performed. perl-IO-Socket therefore doesn't allow wildcards for smtp. perl-IO-Socket has the most flexible implementation I've seen so far but intentionally only supports one wildcard at the leftmost side. What a mess.  cu Ludwig  --   (o_   Ludwig Nussel  //\     V_/_  http://www.suse.de/ SUSE LINUX Products GmbH, GF: Markus Rex, HRB (AG Nuernberg)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
