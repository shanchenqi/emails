The most common implementation is to just allow the simple form *.something so I'd assume that other patterns are rare in the wild. The last commenter in the aforementioned Mozilla bug says that *.*.appspot.com is actually used by Google though.  Anyways, the matching function in libesmtp certainly is good enough. I was just surprised that wildcards at the right hand side are allowed. What about the actual patch I sent though? :-)  cu Ludwig  --   (o_   Ludwig Nussel  //\     V_/_  http://www.suse.de/ SUSE LINUX Products GmbH, GF: Markus Rex, HRB (AG Nuernberg)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
