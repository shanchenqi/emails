Your reasoning is sound. It's a good discussion to have, and especially good to have in public.  Please don't take this personally in any way, your message just happened to be the one everyone paid attention to.

Just think of all the PR the conference has just gotten :)  Thanks.  --      JB  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
