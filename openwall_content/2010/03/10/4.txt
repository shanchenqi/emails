Iradier Muro" <airadier@...rs.sourceforge.net> Subject: CVE Request -- aMSN -- improper SSL certificate validation (MITM)  Hi Steve, vendors,     Gabriel Menezes Nunes reported:      [1]     a deficiency in the way aMSN messenger validated SSL certificates when    connecting to the MSN server. A remote attacker could conduct man-in-the-middle    attacks and / or impersonate trusted servers.     Affected version:      Issue originally reported against aMSN but further research showed [4]      latest aMSN still suffers from the flaw.     References:      [2]      [3]      [4]      [5]     Upstream (testing) patch:      [6]  Not sure, if this already got a CVE id, but in case if not, could you allocate one?
