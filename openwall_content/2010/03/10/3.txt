However, the match_domain() function probably should be rewritten anyways I guess. It matches patters such as 'foo.bar.*' which is rather weird.  libESMTP also uses the Common Name as fallback even if a dNSName in subjectAltName is present but doesn't match. The Common Name should be ignored in that case according to  The code to perform the checks is quite complicated with openSSL and I'm not an expert so I'd be glad if someone could review the patch. This really belongs into a library ...  cu Ludwig  --   (o_   Ludwig Nussel  //\     V_/_  http://www.suse.de/ SUSE LINUX Products GmbH, GF: Markus Rex, HRB (AG Nuernberg)  View attachment of type "text/x-patch" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
