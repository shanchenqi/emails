Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> CC: oss-security <oss-security@...ts.openwall.com> Subject: CVE Request -- Dovecot -- DoS (excessive CPU use) by processing  email with huge header  Hi Steve, vendors,     Dovecot upstream has released latest version of Dovecot IMAP server:      [1]     addressing one denial of service issue (from upstream announcement):    "mbox users really should upgrade, because by sending a message with     a huge header you could basically cause a DoS (this problem exists only     with v1.2.x, not with v1.0 or v1.1)."     References:      [2]      [3]      [4]  Could you allocate a CVE id for it?
