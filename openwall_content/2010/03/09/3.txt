From what I can tell, two should be enough:    a, libESMTP doesn't properly handle NULL character in Common Name       References:               http://ioactive.com/pdfs/PKILayerCake.pdf (issue 2c)     b, libESMTP's match_component() accepts two strings as equal       if they start equal but don't have equal length => cert forgery       References:            Kees, please correct me, if I omitted something.
