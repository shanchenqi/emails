Thanks.  Unfortunately, this is not usable to screen announcements of those non-academic cons like CanSecWest or HITB.  Also, I would like moderation decisions to be simpler.  Unfortunately, the only way to make them simpler appears to be to get back to rejecting any and all "conference stuff".  Maybe this is the right thing to do, maybe not.  That said, I won't be approving any further "multi-conference" stuff, but I've just approved a HITB announcement...  BTW, Hafez Kamal has been a subscriber to oss-security for a while.
