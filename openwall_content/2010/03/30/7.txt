The affected code is in  ipv4/tcp_input.c and there's no mention of tcp_v6_conn_request() there.  I'm guessing this was fixed in Linux  Arguably this could have been given a ID, but the patch didn't  clearly label the problem as a security issue, so I will treat Eugene's  request as the first widely-public disclosure - thus a date.
