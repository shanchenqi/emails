I am unfamiliar with Alien Arena, but in the original Quake II engine code, this bug is in the sv_user.c SV_ExecuteUserCommand function.  The following line is incorrect:  	Cmd_TokenizeString (s, true);  The 'true' specifies that the server should expand $macros in the string, this is what allows the client to see the values of server-side cvars. The fix is simply to change true to false:  	Cmd_TokenizeString (s, false);  On the same function, you should also verify that the string 's' does not contain any 0xFF bytes, as if these are sent over the net to other clients, it will cause them to think the server message has ended prematurely and disconnect from the server.  The list of Quake II engine bugs posted on the QuakeDev forums is not complete unfortunately, especially as it only lists server exploits. There are numerous issues with the client code that a malicious server could exploit to cause buffer overflows with arbitrary code execution. I would recommend you download my R1Q2 engine source from and grep for any "//r1" comments as all the security fixes are documented in the source.  Regards,  Rich.
