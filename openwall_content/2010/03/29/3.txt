Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> CC: oss-security <oss-security@...ts.openwall.com>,         Richard Stanway <r1ch@...h.net> Subject: CVE Request -- Quake II Server -- two security issues affecting also  Alien Arena  Hi Steve, vendors,     (based on [1]  Richard Stanway posted on QuakeDev Forums page:    [2]  two new vulnerabilities affecting also code, as present in Alien Arena (from [2]):     A, "Multiple auto downloading DoS conditions:        By supplying various invalid parameters to the download command,        it is possible to cause a DoS condition by causing the server to        crash. A path ending in . or / will crash on Linux. Supplying        a negative offset will cause a crash on all platforms."     Proposed patch:    ----------------      [3]     Public PoC ([4]    -----------      cmd download maps/tca-zion.bsp     CVSSv2 Score: 4.0/AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:N/A:P    -------------     B, "Server-side cvar expansion:        By passing an unexpanded string containing $macros to the        server, the server will expand it using it's cvars. This can        be used to leak sensitive information such as the rcon_password cvar."     Proposed patch: N/A    ---------------     Richard, is there a patch for this issue yet?     Public PoC: [5]    -----------    At the client console: "say $rcon_password"     CVSSv2 Score: 4.0/ AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N    -------------  Regarding the B, issue -- not completely sure alienarena-server supports "server-side cvar expansion" (but assuming so). Richard, could you please clarify this?  Steve, could you allocate the CVE ids for these two issues? (once issue B, confirmed).
