Due deficiency in the implementation  of the TSO (TCP segment offloading), the guest's virtio-net driver  transmitted improper data to the particular QEMU-KVM process on the host,  resulting in its termination. A remote attacker could use this flaw to  cause denial of service (guest crash) by sending certain,  specially-crafted data to arbitrary open port on the target guest system.  A remote attacker could exploit this to crash guests which use virtio networking on Linux kernels earlier than  Note that this was previously reported in Canonical's launchpad but no CVE  name was ever assigned AFAIK.
