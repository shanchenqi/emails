Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE Request: ViewVC / -- XSS via user-provided  'search_re' input  Just received an announcement stating ViewVC and were released today (right on the heels of and for which I still haven't received a CVE). Looks like they fix an XSS that needs a CVE assigned.  "security fix: escape user-provided search_re input to avoid XSS attack"   Here's the patch for the XSS:  """ There were too many ways to do something as simple as HTML escaping in the ViewVC codebase.  Simplify, conjoin, remove, etc.  * lib/sapi.py   (escape): New function.  *The* preferred HTML-escaping mechanism.   (Server.escape): New common Server object escape mechanism (which     uses the aforementioned escape(), of course).   (CgiServer.escape, WsgiServer.escape, AspServer.escape,    ModPythonServer.escape): Lose as unnecessary.  * lib/viewvc.py   (Request.get_form): Escape hidden form variable names and values.   (htmlify): Remove.   (): Replace all uses of cgi.escape() and htmlify() with (directly or     indirectly) sapi.escape().    * lib/query.py   (main): Use server.escape() instead of cgi.escape().  * lib/blame.py   (HTMLBlameSource.__getitem__): Use sapi.escape() instead of     cgi.escape().  * lib/idiff.py   (_mdiff_split, _differ_split): Use sapi.escape() instead of     cgi.escape().
