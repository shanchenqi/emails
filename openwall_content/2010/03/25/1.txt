First you say that you agree with my decision to be selective about the announcements (reject some, approve some others), then you state that "such announcements" (all of them?) don't add any value in your opinion.  Please clarify.  > Unless someone has a compelling argument FOR letting these though,  So far, I only got a few "I don't mind to receive these" responses (off-list).  I don't think these count as "compelling arguments", yet I am also not very comfortable about rejecting messages that some people are sending and others don't mind receiving.  > I think this is an acceptable policy.  Please define the policy first.  I think that it's not great to just do nothing about these postings - neither approve nor reject them, letting them get bounced to the senders with an automated message stating that "the list moderators for the oss-security list have failed to act on your post."  It is best to either approve or explicitly reject messages, providing an explanation to the sender.  As you have noticed, I've approved two additional HITB postings recently - one about the videos (somewhat valuable), the other a correction (of little value).  I think the videos posting was in fact desirable, and it felt illogical to reject these after having approved the Agenda posting.

Jonathan Brossard has been on the oss-security list for some months.  I guess you don't want this approved - at least, you're not doing that. If so, I'd appreciate it if you help us define a policy and explicitly reject this posting according to that.  Or should we approve it?  Or do you want us to not get distracted to this topic, continuing to ignore it (as being of little relevance to the purpose of oss-security)?
