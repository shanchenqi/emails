Which will then be disassembled into a series of mail-merged individual invitations (aka. multi-posting, which was worse than cross-posting)?  If that would happen, I'd object.  I also object to "badly cross-posted" invitations.  > 4) Approve posts from list memebers who've been on the list for > 1 month. >     (I suspect this is the best solution)  A "List member[...]" might be a lurker, might be an occasional contributor, or a regular contributor.  As a pointed question: Would you allow spammers to dump their UCE here if they only were subscribers for four weeks?  More seriously, what relevance has the duration of a subscription?  My answer is: none whatsoever.  There simply isn't any merit in being subscribed alone. I find that this criterion, while objective, says nothing about contributions of the subscriber to the list, and is therefore not useful.  I acknowledge that finding objective criteria is hard, but #4 is IMO just a very bad loophole.  FWIW, I'm getting spamvertisements for conferences directed at me personally, and I find that offensive and it should be a reason to prohibit the conference altogether, so as to have a real incentive not to spam.  At the very least, conference advertisements, if allowed in moderation, should be tagged so that people can automatically filter them. Filter instructions could then be on the list's accompanying homepage.  --  Matthias Andree  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
