This bug can at  least be used to perform DoS attacks.  Looking at the code, I can see multiple, similarly affected, calls.  For tracking purposes (and hoping nobody else has run and assigned one  themselves) I've assigned  [1] Z_STRVAL_P(method_name_out) = estrdup(XMLRPC_RequestGetMethodName(response));  Kind regards, --  Raphael Geissert - Debian Developer www.debian.org - get.debian.net  Download attachment "signature.asc " of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
