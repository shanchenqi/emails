More from Bugtraq post:    [1]  "Apache CouchDB versions prior to version are vulnerable to timing attacks, also known as side-channel information leakage, due to using simple break-on-inequality string comparisons when verifying hashes and passwords."  References:    [2] http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Breaking_changes    [3] http://codahale.com/a-lesson-in-timing-attacks/    [4] http://couchdb.apache.org/    [5] http://couchdb.apache.org/downloads.html  Credit:    Jason Davies of the Apache CouchDB development team  [1] references as CVE id, but is Apache Tomcat flaw:    [6]  Since Apache CouchDB is different code base, susceptible to the same issue as in [3], assuming new CVE identifier is required.  Steve, could you allocate one?
