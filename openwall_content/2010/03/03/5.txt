We've been pointed out to public reports of remote SSL server crashes in OpenSSL builds with kerberos support, triggered by the Nessus' ssl_supported_ciphers test.  We've managed to track this problem to a missing return value check, causing incorrect input to be passed to the krb5 library, resulting in NULL pointer dereference crash in krb5 (recent MIT krb5 versions).  Issue can be reproduced with chrooted SSL servers (such as dovecot's login process or chrooted stunnel).  Report we got, with references to previous public discussions:    Details of the flaw:    Upstream patch:    We've assigned to this issue.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
