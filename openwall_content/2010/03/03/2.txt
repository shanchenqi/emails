PHP is a worldwide web language used by individuals as well as companies (Facebook...). This session aims at providing a hands-on focused PHP Hacking experience. After this course, you will really know how attackers work and move through PHP hax0ring so that they can jump deeper down to your networks.  *BONUS* This training will end with a final amazing exercise through a step by step live hacking simulation. It will help students at coming back to offensive and defensive hands-on actions seen during the whole day, thanks to this complete information warfare operation.  For further information, just check :   Register as soon as possible (!) and join us at Cansecwest (http://cansecwest.com)  See you soon in Vancouver for more PHP Hacking :)  -- Laurent OUDOT  Founder & CEO of TEHTRI-Security  http://www.tehtri-security.com             Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
