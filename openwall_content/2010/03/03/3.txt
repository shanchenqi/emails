Several other postings of "this nature" (not training courses but mostly conference CFPs, though) were not approved.  Yet I thought it was time to revisit this issue, and Laurent's posting was a good choice because I knew that Laurent had actually joined the list first (unlike most others who try to cross-post their CFPs in here).  The last time this topic was brought up, two of the list members ("founding members", so to speak) said they were OK with these postings getting through to the list "presuming they stay on the topic of Open Source Security" and "are not badly cross-posted":   In practice, many of the postings were in fact "badly cross-posted" and none of the moderators approved them (so they should have bounced back to the senders in a few days).  Sometimes it is difficult to determine if a posting is cross-posted "badly enough" or not, though.  Another thing to keep in mind is that those cross-posts provide extra visibility to oss-security, making more people aware of this list.  If we don't approve them, then people will stop trying to CC: oss-security on their announcements, so we won't be getting this extra visibility. It is not clear whether this would be a good or a bad thing.  So far, the visibility did not hurt, though - reasonable people were joining the list, and we have pre-moderation for postings by new members anyway.  Can we agree on an approach that would make moderation decisions easier? With about one announcement of this kind per month coming our way lately (on average), maybe we should simply be approving them all, whether cross-posted or not?  Should we treat invitations to cons and training courses with expensive registration differently from those that are free or cheap?  I imagine that Laurent's posting was a for-profit one, which was one of the reasons why I hesitated approving it.  I'd rather not base moderation decisions on this, though, because it'd be difficult to draw the line, and also because these "expensive" postings are not any worse in terms of the visibility they might provide to oss-security (if visibly CC'ed, which was not the case for Laurent's posting).
