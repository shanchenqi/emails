Sorry about not informing oss-security when I did this; I meant to.  has been rejected since it was used heavily for multiple  issues that should have been assigned separate entries.  People weren't  just using for Samba, they were using it for fuse and  others.  This rejection has since been uploaded to the CVE site:   Along with the three new CVEs:  (Samba) (ncpfs) (FUSE)  I try very hard to avoid doing this kind of split (and REJECT) except when  it seems like there will be a lot of confusion; I know how much work it is  to clean these up in advisories and so on.  I recognize that many people  have used for the Samba problem, but it's been used in  for FUSE and for ncpfs, for example.  An  administrator who thinks that is fixed" might have solved  the ncp issue but still be vulnerable to the Samba issue.  I had originally asked oss-security for clarification on this, without an  answer:   (recognizing that I'm the most guilty party for not answering...) but  other situations forced me to clear this out.  > I'm also confused on using a name since our bugzilla entry is > dated and Samba upstream has their reported dated > so these should have received names.  I agree - this was an error on my part, so I apologize for the confusion.  - Steve
