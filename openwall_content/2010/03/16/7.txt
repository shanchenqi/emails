In case of two common names, this is wrong.  So instead of int l = (cert),                              NID_commonName, buf, sizeof buf);  one needs something like:      *name = ;      if(name)                 i=j;     Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
