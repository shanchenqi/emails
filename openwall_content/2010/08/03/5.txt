Redhat already provided CVE  numbers, thanks.  A: (PHPCAS-61) [3] is a serious issue. It allows you to  hijack any authenticated user session if get access to a users service  ticket in any way. The submitted service ticket was used to rename the  http session before actually validating the ticket. If you intercept or  guess a service ticket you can hijack a user session without proper  ticket validation.  B: (PHPCAS-67) [4] is a minor issue. phpCAS is not  sanatizing a submitted value. Might be usable for XSS in cas proxy mode.   The phpCAS library is included in multiple other projects: glpi,moodle,tikiwiki,claroline etc. that might be vulnerable as well   Regards,  Joachim Fritschi   [1] https://wiki.jasig.org/display/CASC/phpCAS [2] [3] https://issues.jasig.org/browse/PHPCAS-61 [4] https://issues.jasig.org/browse/PHPCAS-67      Download attachment "smime.p7s" of type "application/pkcs7-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
