Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: kernel: [PARISC] led.c - fix potential stack overflow in led_proc_write()  Ilja reported way back in Nov A writer to /proc/pdc/led(?) can  cause the kernel to consume an unbounded amount of stack, and result in  stack corruption.   If you need a CVE name, change the subject to indicate that. We are not  requesting one as we do not support the PA-RISC architecture in our  distribution.
