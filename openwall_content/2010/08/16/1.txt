Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE request - kernel: integer overflow in ext4_ext_get_blocks()  This was reported by a customer. Integer overflow flaws were found in  ext4_ext_in_cache() and ext4_ext_get_blocks(). We managed to triggered  the case in ext4_ext_get_blocks() but did not attempt to try the other.  This can trigger a BUG() on certain configuration of ext4 file systems.
