Either way, I  would have thought it should be fixed.  Tim  PS Is it just me or does "I fail to see how RLIMIT_NPROC should have any affect  on setuid." in the comments a touch disconcerting given that it's from the PAM  maintainer? --  Tim Brown <mailto:timb@...-dimension.org.uk> <http://www.nth-dimension.org.uk/>  Download attachment "signature.asc " of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
