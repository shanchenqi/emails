The only  times I've seen empty specifications it's because of bugs such as the one Dan  has reported.  Is there a case to look at harding the dynamic linker to reject empty  specifications; there's not much that one can do where someone has explicitly  set a stupid LD_LIBRARY_PATH?  I appreciate that this might has some unwanted  outcomes (such as breaking compatibility with other POSIX-alike OS) but  sometimes there's a good argument for breaking compatibility if it increases  security (some of the various grsec kernel and GCC compiler hardening changes  would be good examples here).
