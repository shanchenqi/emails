I'll let Josh assign a CVE to avoid the  possibility of dupes.  General practice (subject to modification on a case-by-case basis) is:  - issue was never fixed and never claimed to be fixed: use original CVE    (probably triggers an update to description for affected versions)  - issue was claimed fixed but the fix was incomplete: use new CVE  - issue was never fixed but claimed to be fixed: ??? (it's happened a few    times)    - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
