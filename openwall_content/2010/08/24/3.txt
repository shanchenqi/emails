A configured Border Gateway Protocol    (BGP) peer could send a Route-Refresh message with specially-crafted    Outbound Route Filtering (ORF) record, which would cause the master BGP    daemon (bgpd) to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the    privileges of the user running bgpd.     Upstream changeset:    [1]     References:    [2]    [3]  B, DoS (crash) while processing certain BGP update AS path messages     A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way Quagga's bgpd daemon    parsed paths of autonomous systems (AS). A configured BGP peer could send    a BGP update AS path request with unknown AS type, which could lead to    denial of service (bgpd daemon crash).     Upstream changeset:    [4]     References:    [5]    [6]  Could you allocate CVE ids for these?
