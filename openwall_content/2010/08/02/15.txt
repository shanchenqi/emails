I gave it an ID, as I'm going to presume that the cabextract application is likely used in things like virus and mail scanners, where we don't want a crashing application.  One of the unfortunate aspects of assigning a large number of CVE ids, is sometimes I have to assume things, as I lack the time to properly understand what's going on for everything. I figure it's easier to dispute an ID than end up in the situation where a scary exploit vector is found later. You are welcome to, and should, dispute this if you think I'm mistaken.  I would have likely turned down such a request for say an image viewer.  Thanks for the followup though, it's nice to know someone is watching us watchers ;)  --      JB  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
