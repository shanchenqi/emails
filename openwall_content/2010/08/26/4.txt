HITB SIGINT sessions are designed to provide a quick 15 minute overview for material and research that's up and coming - stuff that isn't quite ready for the mainstream tracks of the conference but deserve a mention nonetheless. Final year students who want to present their projects to industry experts are also strongly encouraged to submit their papers.  These sessions are held during the conference coffee and lunch breaks. The papers would be reviewed by the main CFP panel and student submissions will be reviewed by the HITB Team. The best research paper presented will be voted on by the audience. This session is strictly meant for research papers that are at least 50% COMPLETE at the time of submission.  What you get:  # Chance to present your research at an international conference # Chance to get your research seen and reviewed by industry experts # Full access to the conference on October worth # Best research as voted by the audience will be given ONE FREE training in HITB SecConf Malaysia # Best research will be uploaded to the HITB conference materials segment and mirrored through HITB affiliates / partners (Packetstorm, etc)  Submissions are due 1st October For further details, please see:  --- Hafez Kamal HITB Crew Hack in The Box (M) Sdn.
