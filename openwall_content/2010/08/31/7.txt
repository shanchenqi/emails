(Very old, unwieldy definitions here:  http://cve.mitre.org/about/terminology.html)  The risk may be very minimal, but the FORTIFY_SOURCE protection mechanism  is not working "as advertised" - it can be manipulated for an  admittedly-small information leak.  Use for the issue.  - Steve   On Tue, 31 Aug Josh Bressers wrote:  > ----- "Nico Golde" <oss-security+ml@...lde.de> wrote: > >> Hi, >> >> did this ever get a CVE id?
