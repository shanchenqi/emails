That's  Therefore up to three CVE numbers could be assigned a) insecure default of gs b) applications don't pass -P- c) non working -P-/SEARCH_HERE_FIRST  Fixing a) means b) isn't needed but then it's just a compile time default that may or may not be changed by distros.  Both a) and b) imply a fix for c) though. No idea if a separate CVE is actually useful in that case.  We've decided for a), fix gs once and for all. Hopefully. :-)  cu Ludwig  --   (o_   Ludwig Nussel  //\     V_/_  http://www.suse.de/ SUSE LINUX Products GmbH, GF: Markus Rex, HRB (AG Nuernberg)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
