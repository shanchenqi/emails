I believe we should try to clarify what got actually assigned to, as it seems to be used for more than one thing:  - ghostscript uses CWD to search for initialization files - gv did not pass -P- to gs, leading to problems related to the default   mentioned above - some ghostscript versions search CWD even when started with -P-  > I personally would also suggest fixing gs to not look in the current > directory by default (looking for important stuff in the current > directory is really always a bad idea). I guess the problem is how to > fix it.  As previously mentioned, upstream changed SEARCH_HERE_FIRST default to address this.  I believe SuSE updates did the same change already too.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
