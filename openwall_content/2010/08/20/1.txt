Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE request - kernel: jfs: don't allow os2 xattr namespace overlap  with others  Upstream commit:  Description from the commit: It's currently possible to bypass xattr  namespace access rules by prefixing valid xattr names with "os2.", since  the os2 namespace stores extended attributes in a legacy format with no  prefix.  This patch adds checking to deny access to any valid namespace prefix  following "os2.".
