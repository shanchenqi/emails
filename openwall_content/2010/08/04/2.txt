Arguably, this is the same core bug and could have  been merged into even though the versions are different.  Effectively, you've got multiple independent "streams" of 2.2.x Apache -  which vary by operating system - and there's no overlap between which  "stream" is affected by versus the ones that are affected by   And there are no regression errors.  This general  abstraction difficulty applies to most software that runs on multiple  platforms, where each platform has slightly different up-to-date versions,  or delays in fixes for some platforms versus others.  (You could extend  the logic to how each distro maintains its own versions of common  software...)  However, this is a fairly arcane point that demonstrates the difficulty of  keeping CVE consistent with only a couple simple rules (split-by-vulntype  and split-by-version), instead of getting mired in lots of exceptions.  As a practical matter, this is a fairly important distinction, and if we  were to MERGE into and update the description, that might  not be enough of a "signal" to sysadmins that they have to re-evaluate  their security posture.  So I'm reluctantly OK with leaving  separate - but I don't want to set this up as a formal precedent for these  kinds of abstraction choices for later disclosures.  - Steve   On Fri, 30 Jul Joe Orton wrote:  > Jeremy Sowden discovered an information leak in mod_proxy affecting > httpd version only.
