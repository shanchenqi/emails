Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> CC: oss-security <oss-security@...ts.openwall.com> Subject: CVE Request -- OpenConnect <  did not verify SSL server certificates  Hello Steve, vendors,     OpenConnect upstream has released OpenConnect    [1] http://www.infradead.org/openconnect.html  addressing following security related issues (from [1]):    OpenConnect â       * Always validate server certificate, even when no extra --cafile is provided.      * Add --no-cert-check option to avoid certificate validation.      * Check server hostname against its certificate.      * Provide text-mode function for reviewing and accepting "invalid" certificates.      * Fix libproxy detection on NetBSD.  References:    [2]    [3]  Though not direct security issue(s) [rather security hardening], once the package has SSL support, it should be enabled by default to avoid unintentional MITM attacks (implying from default package configuration use).  Steve, could you allocate a CVE identifier for this? (but opened for discussion if such security hardening fixes aren't considered enough this to be handled as a security issue).
