Maybe obvious and natural conclusion from previous post already, but Panu clarified yet, similar deficiency holds for dealing with posix file capabilities and SELinux contexts, i.e. they are not cleared after pkg upgrade. Not sure second CVE is needed for this, but if one is enough, wanted to explicitly mention this, so it can be described in the text of the CVE too.
