Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: jar, fastjar directory traversal vulnerabilities  Hi all.  A directory traversal flaw was reported in fastjar [1] that was assigned  Upon investigation, it was found that the jar program [2] had a similar problem.  No CVE name was assigned to the jar issue, however it looks like they are two different programs with two different code bases.  There is also some confusion because these issues are similar to (or a result of incomplete fixes for) (fastjar) and (jar).  What makes things worse is that it doesn't look like was ever fixed.  So I'm not sure if this "new" jar issue needs a new CVE name, or if it would be covered under (since nothing ever claimed to fix this directory traversal vulnerability in jar).  Any insight from MITRE would be appreciated.  I've not assigned a CVE name to the "new" jar issue because of this confusion.  --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
