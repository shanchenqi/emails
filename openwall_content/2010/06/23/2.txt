Not requesting a CVE name for this since it only affect  certain thinkpads/xorg.  "Given the right combination of ThinkPad and X.org, just reading the  video output control state is enough to hard-crash X.org.  Until the day I somehow find out a model or BIOS cut date to not provide  this feature to ThinkPads that can do video switching through X RandR,  change permissions so that only processes with CAP_SYS_ADMIN can access  any sort of video output control state.  This bug could be considered a local DoS I suppose, as it allows any non-privledged local user to cause some versions of X.org to hard-crash  some ThinkPads."
