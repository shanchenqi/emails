A remote,    authenticated attacker could use these flaws to alter integrity of the system    (write and / or delete arbitrary files) by providing a specially-crafted list    variable content to the edit or save request.     Florian, please correct me, if I mangled the attack scenario, and it's slightly    different.     Martin, Morten, are these two issues known upstream yet? Is there a patch for them already?     Steve, could you please allocate two CVE ids?    (One for 1, 'edit' case, second for 2, 'save' case.) [Searching "Master Copy of CVE" for "mlmmj"     keyword returned nothing for me.]  References:    [2]    [3]  Thanks && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
