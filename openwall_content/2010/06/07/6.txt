The fix is not in the validation of the vertical label field in the UI  or database, but when the text is used in execution of the rrdtool  command line option for the vertical label.  Please keep all inquiries directed to me.  Thanks,  Tony Roman Cacti Developer  On AM, Larry Adams wrote: > > > On AM, Steven M.
