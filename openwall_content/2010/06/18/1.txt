The badly stretched VLC development team is not currently able to  maintain more than two development branches at a time. The team has been  focusing on the VLC 1.2 future series and the VLC 1.1 stable series.  As a consequence, source code for VLC 1.0 is not officially unmaintained  anymore. There will be no further security or major bug fixes. The last version  was and will be marked formally obsolete if/when a major issue is  discovered. I would also like to remind you that: - the LibVLC API is known to be broken in all 1.0.x releases, - that the Mozilla plugin is broken on X11 platforms in release and - that binary packages (Windows, MacOS) have already been discontinued.  If you need any of these, please update to VLC already, or at  the earliest.  N.B.: VLC and older versions exhibit known published  security issues. Update urgently if you have not already done so.  Best regards,  --  RĂŠmi Denis-Courmont  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
