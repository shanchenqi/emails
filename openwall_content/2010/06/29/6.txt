In these cases, since simply viewing a TIFF image will crash any application linked against libtiff, and given a past record of DoS issues in image libraries (and libtiff in particular) receiving CVEs, I see no reason why these bugs should be treated any differently.  In any case, I leave that decision to those who assign CVEs.  >> 2.  A NULL pointer derefrence in TIFFVGetField() may result in >> application crash >> > > This got from Mitre few days ago.  But I guess you're > going to (or should?) ask for one more for td_stripbytecount case I > pointed out in one of the previous replies (split due to different > fixed-in version).  Sauli's fuzzer to blame for the discovery again ;). >  In that case, we've got three CVE-pending issues, each of which have been described in more detail in previous posts:  1.  OOB read in TIFFExtractData() leading to crash.  2.  NULL pointer dereference due to invalid td_stripbytecount leading to crash (distinct from  3.  OOB read in TIFFRGBAImageGet() leading to crash.  -Dan  > -- > Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team >  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
