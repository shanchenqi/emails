The only real change is to paste.httpexceptions,  > which was using insecure quoting of some parameters and allowed an XSS  > hole,  > most specifically with its messages.  The most notably WSGI  > application  > using this is paste.urlparse.StaticURLParser and PkgResourcesParser.  By  > directing someone to an appropriately formed URL an attacker can execute  > arbitrary Javascript on the victim's client.  paste.urlmap.URLMap is also  > affected, but only if you have no application attached to /.  Other  > applications using paste.httpexceptions may be effected (especially  > HTTPNotFound).  WebOb/webob.exc.HTTPNotFound is not affected.
