Yeah, [C] refers to two issues:    1, SQL injection issue, known under /       Proper patch is here: [1] and     2, OS command injection issue, /       References:  [2]       Proper patches are the following three: (noticed by Tomas Hoger && confirmed by Tony Roman, thanks for it!)         [3]         [4]         [5]  Also, there were also some regressions related with Cacti    [6]   From [6]:  "If you have already upgraded to you can simple move back to and "Cacti will be release on June 7th to address these issues.".  Not sure if Cacti will address yet some security issues, so Cc-ed Cacti Developers and Tony Roman on this email to detail, if necessary.
