When the user uses feh to open a remote file (URL) and uses the --wget-timestamp option, feh passe the unescaped URL to a system() call.  So if an attacker can trick the user into opening an image URL containing shell metacharacters with feh --wget-timestamp, he is able to execute arbitrary shell code with the rights of the user executing feh. This requires the URL to resolve to an existing file, however. Obfuscating the shell code with HTTP escapes (like %20) does not seem to work, and a redirect (via tinyurl or similar) to a malicious URL will also have no effect.  Example: remnant /t/feh > ls remnant /t/feh > feh --wget-timestamp 'https://derf.homelinux.org/stuff/bar`touch lol_hax`.jpg' /bin/cp: cannot stat No such file or directory feh WARNING: lol_hax`.jpg does not exist - skipping feh WARNING: lol_hax`.jpg - File does not exist feh - No loadable images specified. Use feh --help for detailed usage information remnant /t/feh > ls lol_hax remnant /t/feh >  This has been fixed in feh 1.8: <https://derf.homelinux.org/projects/feh/changelog>  Please assign a CVE.
