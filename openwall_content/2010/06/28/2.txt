Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> CC: oss-security <oss-security@...ts.openwall.com> Subject: CVE Request -- libpng and -- memory leak while processing  PNG image with malformed sCAL chunks  Hi Steve, vendors,     libpng upstream has released latest and versions, addressing two security issues: [a], out-of-bounds write to memory -- this already got a CVE id of [b], memory-leak bug, involving images with malformed sCAL chunks, which could     lead to an application crash.  References:    [1] http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html    [2]  Steve, could you allocate a CVE id for the [b] issue?
