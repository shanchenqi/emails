Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE request - kernel: cifs: Fix a kernel BUG with remote OS/2 server  "This was known to trigger with a OS/2 server. The server sets  pSMBr->CountHigh to a incorrect value even in case of normal writes.  This results in 'nbytes' being computed wrongly and triggers a kernel  BUG at mm/filemap.c.       void iov_iter_advance(struct iov_iter *i, size_t bytes)      {              BUG_ON(i->count < bytes);    <--- BUG here  Why the server is setting 'CountHigh' is not clear but only does so  after writing 64k bytes. Though this looks like the server bug, the  client side crash may not be acceptable.  The workaround is to mask off high 16 bits if the number of bytes  written as returned by the server is greater than the bytes requested by  the client."   --  main(i) { >> (i-1) * && main(++i); }  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
