Previous versions were embargoed.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  When guest user code running inside a Xen guest operating system attempts to execute a syscall or sysenter instruction, but when the guest operating system has not registered a handler for that instruction, a General Protection Fault may need to be injected into the guest.  It has been discovered that the code in Xen which does this fails to clear a flag requesting exception injection, with the result that a future exception taken by the guest and handled entirely inside Xen will also be injected into the guest despite Xen having handled it already, probably crashing the guest.  IMPACT ======  User space processes on some guest operating systems may be able to crash the guest.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  HVM guests are not vulnerable.  32- and 64-bit PV guests may be vulnerable, depending on the CPU hardware, the guest operating system, and its exact kernel version and configuration.  MITIGATION ==========  This issue can be mitigated by running HVM (fully-virtualised).  In some cases this issue can be mitigated by upgrading the guest kernel to one which installs hooks for sysenter and/or syscall, as applicable.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch will resolve the issue.  These patches also resolve the (more serious) issue described in XSA-7  These changes have been made to the staging Xen repositories:                     XSA-7:              XSA-8:  xen-unstable.hg       xen-4.1-testing.hg    xen-4.0-testing.hg    xen-3.4-testing.hg    PATCH INFORMATION =================  The attached patches resolve both this issue and that reported in XSA-7   xen-unstable or later    xsa7-xsa8-unstable-recent.patch    xen-unstable or earlier   Xen 4.1, 4.1.x                               Xen 4.0, 4.0.x                               Xen 3.4, 3.4.x                               $ xsa7-xsa8-*patch   xsa7-xsa8-unstable-recent.patch     NOTE REGARDING EMBARGO ======================  The fix for this issue has already been published as xen-unstable.hg changesets and  However, this has not been flagged as a security problem, and since the affected area of code is the same as that for XSA-7 we have concluded that this advisory should be under the same embargo as XSA-7. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =elZi -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----   Download attachment "xsa7-xsa8-unstable-recent.patch" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
