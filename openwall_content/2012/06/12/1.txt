Previous versions were embargoed.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Rafal Wojtczuk has discovered a vulnerability which can allow a 64-bit PV guest kernel running on a 64-bit hypervisor to escalate privileges to that of the host by arranging for a system call to return via sysret to a non-canonical RIP.  Intel CPUs deliver the resulting exception in an undesirable processor state.  IMPACT ======  Guest administrators can gain control of the host.  Depending on the particular guest kernel it is also possible that non-privileged guest user processes can also elevate their privileges to that of the host.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All systems running 64 bit Xen hypervisor running 64 bit PV guests on Intel CPUs are vulnerable to this issue.  Systems using AMD CPUs are not vulnerable to this privilege escalation. AMD have issued the following statement:    AMD processors' SYSRET behavior is such that a non-canonical    address in RCX does not generate a #GP while in CPL0. We have    verified this with our architecture team, with our design team, and    have performed tests that verified this on silicon. Therefore, this    privilege escalation exposure is not applicable to any AMD    processor.  While investigating this, it was noted that some older AMD CPUs will lock up under similar circumstances, causing a denial of service. See XSA-9 for details.  MITIGATION ==========  This issue can be mitigated by running HVM (fully-virtualised) or 32 bit PV guests only.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch will resolve the issue.  These patches also resolve the issue described in XSA-8  These changes have been made to the staging Xen repositories:                     XSA-7:              XSA-8:  xen-unstable.hg       xen-4.1-testing.hg    xen-4.0-testing.hg    xen-3.4-testing.hg    PATCH INFORMATION =================  The attached patches resolve both this issue and that reported in XSA-8   xen-unstable or later    xsa7-xsa8-unstable-recent.patch    xen-unstable or earlier   Xen 4.1, 4.1.x                               Xen 4.0, 4.0.x                               Xen 3.4, 3.4.x                               $ xsa7-xsa8-*patch   xsa7-xsa8-unstable-recent.patch    -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =S6KX -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----   Download attachment "xsa7-xsa8-unstable-recent.patch" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
