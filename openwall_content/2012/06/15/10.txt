Wouldn't it be sufficient to refuse > creating DomUs, and still create Dom0?  (Perhaps this suggestion > doesn't make any senseâI'm not familiar with Xen.)   It still makes sense.   There's no easy mechanism to let the hypervisor pass the do-not-create-domU message to dom0 so that the person creating the guest will find out.   There's also a logical problem: dom0 is itself a PV guest.  The admin can take preventative action to disable untrusted PV guests and stopping the system booting is definitely the best way of attracting attention without having potentially difficult to diagnose problems.  jch  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
