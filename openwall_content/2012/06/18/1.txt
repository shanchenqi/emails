Specifically:  1) It was found that Revelation limited effective password lengths to thirty two characters, which made it easier for context-dependent attackers to successfully conduct brute-force password guessing attacks,  2) It was found that Revelation did not iterate the particular passphrase through some of the SHA family of hashing algorithms, in order to derive the encryption key, which made it easier (in that scenario there were only 7 bits to vary on each character) for context-dependent attackers to successfully conduct dictionary based password guessing attacks.  Upstream ticket: [1] http://oss.codepoet.no/revelation/issue/61/file-format-magic-string-version-mismatch  Further references: [2] [3] [4] [5]  Could you allocate two CVE ids for these? (I think two are needed for each of the issues)  Thank you && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team  P.S.: Kurt - regarding time, when this issue has been reported for the first time (thus        which id to allocate), it is necessary to find this it out yet.         Upstream ticket [1] was reported on (which would suggest one        to be allocated), but the rest of the links mention this issue has been known for        longer time, thus please investigate yet. I wanted to Cc- the original ticket        reporter on this request (he to clarify), but I doesn't seem to be        able to find his proper email address / contact. Sorry for that.
