The fix is also in but it is not mentioned in releases notes or changelog file included in the sources.  5.0.x is affected too.  Can the CVE be assigned?  I'm CCing Oracle security team explicitly, so they can reply with their existing assignment (if any), and/or are aware of the new assignment.   Additionally, changes include another security fix:   * Security Fix: Bug was fixed.  However, I've not had much luck trying to find a commit or any further info for this issue.  Upstream bug is private.  Does anyone have any further info?   Additionally, following bugs try to collect info on MySQL security fixes in the last released and an upcoming Oracle CPU:   It would be nice if Oracle could confirm the mapping between CVEs and particular issues to avoid any incorrect guesses.  If anyone else has been looking into trying to map Oracle assigned CVEs to specific changes and has any info missing in the above bugs, feel free to comment there.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
