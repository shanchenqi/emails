Please use for this issue.  Assigned CVE's as the first clear mention of the issues is in the  codepoet.no ticket. The Blog entry for mentions the issue indirectly so I'm going with the more concrete mention.  > Upstream ticket: [1]  > http://oss.codepoet.no/revelation/issue/61/file-format-magic-string-version-mismatch > >  >  > Further references: [2] > [3] > > >  [4] > > >  [5]  > > >  >  > Could you allocate two CVE ids for these?
