An example scenario: a cloud provider offers to attach a USB drive to the VM so you can export the data to the HD which is then fedexed to the customer overnight, or stored separately as a backup, etc. (lets face it, 3tb delivered overnight is a lot faster than any internet link I'll ever have).  The problem is that when USB devices are attached it's possible for the specification of which VM the device is supposed to be attached to to be ignored, resulting in it being attached to a different VM, giving it direct access to the hardware.  Please use for this issue.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org/  =UdD1 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
