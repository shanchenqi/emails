So to summarize properly:  - -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT - -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT - -A INPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-prohibited  results in ICMP unreachable (the -F -S bypasses the "--dport 22 -j ACCEPT" but gets caught in the final "icmp-host-prohibited" rule) with:  hping3 -c 3 -n -S -F -p 22  with:  - -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT - -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 22 -j DROP - -A INPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-prohibited  with hping -F -S the packets bypass the "--dport 22 -j DROP" and get caught by the icmp-host-prohibited  with hping -S the packets get caught by "the "--dport 22 -j DROP"" as expected.  So basically --state new works fine and dandy.   > jch >   - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org/  E7wc+pzPrR/tROyn0aHc =dzax -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
