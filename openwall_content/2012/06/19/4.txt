The year portion of a CVE  identifier can't always be associated with the actual year of disclosure,  and in this case, it's arguable what counts as "sufficient disclosure"  anyway.  A couple minutes of investigation is sufficient.  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
