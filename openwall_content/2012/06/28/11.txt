Just for future reference as well the other magic values are:  ext/standard/info.h:#define PHP_LOGO_GUID  ext/standard/info.h:#define PHP_EGG_LOGO_GUID  ext/standard/info.h:#define ZEND_LOGO_GUID  ext/standard/info.h:#define PHP_CREDITS_GUID  I guess I'm just not a huge fan of surprises in my software =). The expose_php variable appears to control them all no problem.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org/  iQIcBAEBAgAGBQJP7KKnAAoJEBYNRVNeJnmTBQMQAMnFQm+p8WjcsYUz+mWPewrS =Y6Z8 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
