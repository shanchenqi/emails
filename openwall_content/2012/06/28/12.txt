Just for some history on this somewhat odd feature. It was added in order to be able to put the PHP logo on the phpinfo() page. We had originally just used an img link to php.net, but got a lot of phone-home privacy complaints about that. So we needed a way to display an image locally and didn't want to have to try to figure out where to copy that image during installation, plus it would be hard to manage access to it and the overall idea of copying anything to someone's docroot just sucks. So, we could either have given up on it, or, bake it into PHP this way along with an ini switch to disable it. The motivation wasn't to add an easter egg. The April 1 PHP_EGG_LOGO_GUID came later.  - -Rasmus -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org/  =mdWv -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
