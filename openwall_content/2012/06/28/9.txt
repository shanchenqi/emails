A local file disclosure flaw was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team in accountsservice.  From what I understand, there are a few distros that use this due to newer GNOME.  The offending code was added here:   A patch to correct the flaw is attached to our bugzilla bug and will be committed upstream shortly.   The issue is described as follows:  Florian Weimer found a local file disclosure flaw in accountsservice, an account management system using D-Bus for querying and manipulating user accounts.  The implementation of the SetIconFile method of the org.freedesktop.Accounts.User D-Bus interface can disclose arbitrary files due to a race condition in user_change_icon_file_authorized_cb() in /usr/libexec/accounts-daemon.  When this function calls get_caller_uid(), it uses PolicyKit to obtain the UID of the requesting process from /proc.  At the time the UID is fetched, it may not match the original UID making the D-Bus request if the process has executed an SUID binary.  It has been assigned the name  The distros mailing list was notified of this flaw on Monday and made public today  --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
