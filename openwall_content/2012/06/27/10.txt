Christey" <coley@...-smtp.mitre.org> Subject: Re: CVE Request for Drupal contributed modules   All,  I have several clarifications and corrections to this latest Drupal  request and CVE response, on top of the dupes already listed.  The most  important notes are listed first.  (Greg and Kurt, the number of duplicates and unassigned CVEs in this batch  is understandable due to various factors such as amount and assignments  from mutiple sources, but it's disconcerting.  Maybe we should talk  off-list and figure out how to minimize these problems in the future.)  - Aberdeen - Cross Site Scripting  This is a duplicate that might look like a typo at first.  Around May 21, MITRE originally published (NOTE THE  DIFFERENT NUMBER STARTING WITH "29" INSTEAD OF "27").  is in more active use, so keep  We will REJECT  (Kurt, belongs to you.  If you actually intended to list the  already-published and made a typo to please  make sure you've removed from your pool.)   > - BrowserID - Multiple >     Vulnerabilities - CSRF > - BrowserID - Multiple >     Vulnerabilities - BrowserID login theft  The description in is not clear, but it seems that might be the natural consequence of exploiting the CSRF. The title "multiple vulnerabilities" does not help.  Any thoughts on this one?    - Janrain Capture - Open Redirect  mentioned a second separate issue for "An additional security weakness occurs when the module creates a new local user account."  - open redirect  (new) - disclosure of portions of passwords   >  A close reading of suggests that there should be two CVEs.  Part of the advisory does seem to imply that the XSS is resultant from the CSRF; but it also says "This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the maestro admin permissions," which implies that users with maestro admin permissions should not be allowed to conduct XSS attacks themselves.  This could probably be argued either way.  - XSS  (new) - CSRF   > - Organic Groups - Cross Site > Scripting (XSS) and Access Bypass  This is 2 types of issues, thus needs 2 CVEs.  - Access Bypass  (new) - XSS  > - Post Affiliate Pro - Cross Site > Scripting (XSS) and Access Bypass - Unsupported  Two vuln types, two CVEs needed.  - XSS (new) - unspecified read of commisions   - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
