Upstream has corrected the issue in git, but no released packages are available and it looks like this has been around for a while (indicated that 1.x is affected as well, up to and including the current release).  Looks like an authenticated remote root compromise (need to be able to log into bcfg2 to exploit it, and bcfg2 typically runs as root).  Could a CVE be assigned to this please?
