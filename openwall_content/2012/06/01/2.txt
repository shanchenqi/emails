Like I said we might assign a CVE for the kernel as well. As was pointed out to me this is two issues:  1) iptables doing something unexpected, but sort of technically quasi-correct (the best kind of correct ;), realistically firewalling of packets should also include firewalling of modified/mangled version of the packets (because that's what attackers do to circumvent firewalls).  2) OS level, should we allow SYN+FIN at all? Is this a responsibility for the operating system? To some degree yes, it should probably not create a connection based on a mangled SYN packet (and this has been fixed in the 3.x series). Is this a security issue or a security hardening, debatable, but in any event it's a separate code base (kernel) so it would get a separate CVE from the iptables side.   > jch   - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org/  MpOPylIlpoqYUK3XifSk =rsNh -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
