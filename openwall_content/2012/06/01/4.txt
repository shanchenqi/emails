In my limited testing with iptables on RHEL 6.2 it appears that - --state NEW works properly, and won't allow SYN+FIN to create connections (I used hping3 and the SYN+FIN Packets were blocked).  So the default ruleset:  - -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT - -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 22 -j DROP - -A INPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-prohibited  should work, so you could do you clever --syn bits first and then have that set to protect stuff from SYN+FIN.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org/  =e4JD -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
