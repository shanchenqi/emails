I am inclined to think that we should have a separate CVE for the kernel here.   Unless I'm mistaken, a packet with SYN+FIN has no legitimate business being in the Internet any more than the old SYN+RST has.   It's security hardening in that firewall rules to discard packets with odd combinations of flags are often deployed by people setting up "serious" firewalls but most machines out there, whether or not they have iptables set up, don't go to those lengths.  Certainly none of the machines I have access to that have "out of the box" iptables configurations would appear to defend against SYN+FIN for open ports.  - From a purely pragmatic point of view the Nessus plugin at can be read in two ways: there's either a flaw in the firewall or there's a flaw in the kernel.    The fact that the references there talk about a kernel patch for SYN+RST was what lead me to read it as meaning the latter.  It seems that the commit I originally mentioned made it through intact into 3.4 so perhaps we should have a CVE for this?   jch  (Hoping that finally I've found the combination of things for enigmail to correctly sign this one.) -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org/  =kTRA -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
