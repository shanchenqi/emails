Regarding Xen's "pre-disclosure list", are messages on it PGP-encrypted to the recipients?  Perhaps this should be made a requirement and mentioned at http://www.xen.org/projects/security_vulnerability_process.html  It feels likely that in practice most leaks will be via means unaffected by the use of encryption, yet using PGP encryption is worthwhile.
