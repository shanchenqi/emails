In a default/typical MantisBT installation, SOAP API is enabled and any user can sign up to report new issues. This vulnerability therefore impacts upon many public facing MantisBT installations.  References: [1]    CVE REQUEST #2  Title: delete_attachments_threshold not checked on attachment deletion Affected: MantisBT and earlier versions Not affected: MantisBT  Description: Roland Becker (MantisBT developer) found that the delete_attachments_threshold permission was not being checked when a user attempted to delete an attachment from an issue. The more generic update_bug_threshold permission was being checked instead. MantisBT administrators may have been under the false impression that their configuration of the delete_attachments_threshold was successfully preventing unwanted users from deleting attachments.
