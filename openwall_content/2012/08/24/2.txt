As you have pointed out, most CTFs are Open Source related and definietly focus on security. This is exacly what the name of the list is. As many may think, it's not cve-designation list only (obviously I may be wrong about that).  In the other hand, it would be sad to see oss-security list turning into the place, where people are writing walktroughs, spoilers and asks for help (which IMHO would be unavoidable). Filtering all the garbage could be overhelming for moderators.  > Please help us decide.  Maybe you will consider launching a dedicated list for CTFs only?
