This list isn't and shouldn't be in the future only about CVE-requests, but in my opinion one of the best sources to get CVE-identifiers for open source software vulnerabilities thanks to guys like Kurt. In my opinion well planned CTFs are welcome to list as long as it does not go to product marketing and similar activities.  - Henri Salo ps. have a nice weekend and stay safe  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
