This is a heads-up for anyone who may be shipping oVirt. oVirt 3.1 added a new python SDK and CLI which do various fancy things. It supports connecting to servers over SSL, but did not have support for validating certificates, which could lead to a mitm attack.  I've assigned to this issue.  It is corrected in git already.
