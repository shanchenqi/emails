Further investigation into ticket shows that the developer thinks  that issue 2b doesn't need a backport to 0.7.  This would suggest a SPLIT  based on different affected versions.  Plus it's not immediately clear whether this "self XSS" is really an XSS  or not - if I can modify my own signature, then I already have the  "privileges" on my browser to run script.  But, if this "self XSS" is  really just reflected XSS, then that's a security issue to worry about.  This requires expertise in the Roundcube codebase to answer for sure,  though.  So, we should probably SPLIT this CVE.  - Issue 2a - Stored XSS in e-mail body  (new) - Issue 2b - Self XSS in e-mail body (Signature)  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
