OVERVIEW  ocPoral CMS 8.x and lower versions are vulnerable to Session Hijacking flaw which could allow attackers to compromise administrator session.   2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION  ocPortal is the website Content Management System (a CMS) for building and maintaining a dynamic website. ocPortal's powerful feature-set means there's always a way to accomplish your vision. Not only does ocPortal's CMS have all the features you'd expect: for instance photo galleries, news, file downloads and community forums/chats, but it does so whilst meeting the highest accessibility and professional standards. It is also smart enough to go beyond page management, to automatically handle search engine optimisation, and provide aggressive hack attack prevention.   3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION  The ocPoral CMS generates 7-digit session IDs for logged-in users; thus it is possible to work out a valid session ID through brute forcing. Successful hijacking requires the "Enforce IP addresses for sessions" option be disabled. However, when a user's IP is highly dynamic, this option will likely to be disabled as it would invalidate logged-in sessions. In other way, if a user and an attacker happened to be within the same subnet, the attack would succeed regardless of the "Enforce IP" setting turning on.   4. VERSIONS AFFECTED  Tested on version   5. PROOF-OF-CONCEPT/EXPLOIT  sample session cookie:   6. SOLUTION  No fix is available as of Workaround is to set enabled for the option, "Enforce IP addresses for sessions".   7. VENDOR  ocPortal Development Team http://www.ocportal.com/   8.
