Why?  2a doesn't affect 0.7.x, because wash_attribs in these versions has the following code {{{       if (isset($this->_html_attribs[$key]) ||          ($key == 'href' && preg_match('/^(http:|https:|ftp:|mailto:|#).+/i', $value)))         $t .= ' ' . $key . '="' . htmlspecialchars($value, ENT_QUOTES) . '"'; }}} while 0.8.x used to have {{{       if (isset($this->_html_attribs[$key]) ||          ($key == 'href' && preg_match('!^([a-z][a-z0-9.+-]+:|//|#).+!i', $value)))         $t .= ' ' . $key . '="' . htmlspecialchars($value, ENT_QUOTES) . '"'; }}}  As one can see, version from 0.7.x won't allow "javascript:" as 0.8.x's version will, so 0.7.x is clean from this bug (checked sources for and  > Plus it's not immediately clear whether this "self XSS" is really an XSS  > or not - if I can modify my own signature, then I already have the  > "privileges" on my browser to run script.

Basing on the fix,   I believe that the "self XSS" is only triggered when user composes e-mail in HTML mode and one of his text signatures contains some HTML code.  The issue shows up only when a message is composed (so, it doesn't matter for the signatures of received mails) and XSS is triggered by the contents of the signature that the user has for his identity.  So, only the entity that can edit user's signatures will provoke this XSS, thus this vulnerability can be used only with some other one that will allow to modify user's signatures. --  Eygene  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
