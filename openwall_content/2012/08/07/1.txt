By crafting a malicious image with root-readable-only symlinks and requesting a server based on it, an authenticated user could still corrupt arbitrary files (all setups affected) or inject arbitrary files (Essex and later setups with OpenStack API enabled and a libvirt-based hypervisor) on the host filesystem, potentially resulting in full compromise of that compute node.  Folsom fix:  Essex fix:  Diablo fix:  References:  Notes: This fix will be included in the upcoming Nova stable update (due Thursday) and the Folsom-3 development milestone (due next week).  - --  Thierry Carrez (ttx) OpenStack Vulnerability Management Team -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org/  iQIcBAEBCAAGBQJQIXv+AAoJEFB6+JAlsQQjnJUQAI+Vp+GCMXAei/ktStVFrkXC =C2MN -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
