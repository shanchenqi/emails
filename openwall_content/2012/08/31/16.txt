The vulnerable code appears to be:  OUT=`mktemp --tmpdir annotate.XXXXXX` || exit 1 ERR=`mktemp --tmpdir annotate.XXXXXX` || exit 1 rm -f $OUT $ERR mkfifo $OUT $ERR || exit 1  But mkfifo will never create a FIFO over a symlink; the underlying  library function fails with EEXISTS when "pathname already exists. This  includes the case where pathname is a symbolic link, dangling or not."  So AFAICS it's just a DoS, not something giving the attacker "ability in  an unauthorized way to alter files".  --  Jakub Wilk  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
