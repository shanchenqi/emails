All the bug reports I mentioned are about exactly the same issue. The non- public ones have been marked as duplicates of the public one.  I'm aware of at least RC5 containing the incomplete fix[1], but I don't  know in which exact RC version it made its way into. beta2 was still  vulnerable to  PHP RC1 already had the proper fix.  So, since at least PHP had the incomplete fix, I guess a new CVE for  the incomplete fix is in order. Kurt, could you please assign one?  Please let me know if it's not clear enough yet.
