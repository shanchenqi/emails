Assuming they were fixed at some point this leads me to ask:  2) Are you saying that the "header injection detection bypass" wasn't completely fixed by the patches for and and then someone reported originally reported as which has been fixed needs a second CVE (e.g. the "an incomplete fix for original issue led to a second fix being pushed" thing)?  Or am I getting this completely wrong (this is also possible).  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://www.enigmail.net/  =GTXS -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
