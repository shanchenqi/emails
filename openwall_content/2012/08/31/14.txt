Please use for this issue.  One note/comment, in the github discussion I see:  "I think it is more urgent than the previous two security fixes, but as you say it only works for backend users (but even if they have no user module available). I would not thread it as immediate release, but also not wait a few weeks..."  so it looks like they have other issues that may need CVE's as well?  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://www.enigmail.net/  iQIcBAEBAgAGBQJQQQKbAAoJEBYNRVNeJnmTrcoP/1xMq/fkeYggmEj3jnDSORms HcUAXdR4VMgIdmRHnX7V =wvPn -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
