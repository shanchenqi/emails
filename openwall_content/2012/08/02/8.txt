We are currently behind on 17 advisories that are on drupal.org but do not yet have a CVE. I asked the team if anyone else wanted to take over the process of requesting and updating advisories with CVEs. Joshua Brauer (cc'd here) has agreed to take this over as of August 15th.  For completeness, was recently assigned to a path disclosure issue in Drupal that was fixed in Drupal  The Drupal Security Team's opinion is that it's a php configuration mistake to display these kinds of errors to the screen and therefore Drupal was not marked as a security update and did not get a security advisory. We're opinion to alternate opinions on the issue if someone has a case why this should be considered a security issue in Drupal.
