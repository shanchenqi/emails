I don't know how openvswitch-pki works, how it uses this directory, what probelms could possibly arise out of this.  References:   Please note on Fedora 16 and 17 run the command:  /usr/bin/ovs-pki --force init  to create the directories.   Please use for this issue.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org/  1Xsh6Mg+iWBVLsGdBudi =vHIS -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
