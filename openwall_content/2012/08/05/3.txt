I suspect he may not have known about it (this is the first time I can remember hearing of Calligra). Trying to keep track of all possible project forks is pretty much impossible in the modern Open Source world.  Charlie 1): have you requested CVE #'s for this issue for Koffice?  Charlie 2): it appears there are quite a few other security issues in the presentation, are they in open source components, if yes can you please send a CVE request(s) for the issue to oss-security@ so I can assign CVE's for them? Thanks.  Once Charlie replies (either way) I'll assign CVE's.  >>  >> Thanks, Jeff >  >  > As reported by Thorsten Zachmann to the kde-packagers ml, here are > the commit ids: >  >  > The commit IDs for master is  >  > > >  The commit ID for calligra/2.5 is  >  > > >  The commit ID for calligra/2.4 is  >  > > >  Regards, >  > Jorge Manuel B.
