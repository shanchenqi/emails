I'm talking about   It was independently reported by two persons but as of this time their  reports and are still hidden behind the "security bug"  curtain of PHP's bug tracker. Back when they were reported, I had assigned  the following id: "header injection detection bypass." Note that the id only applies to the CR bypass part of the issue.  Then it came this other report originally reported as by the  same person but tagged security, which hid it too), which lead to finally  fixing the bug (but please beware of the original fix by reading [1]).  Unless I missed something, the CR bypass issue was never assigned a CVE id  once it became public. Please do correct me if I'm wrong.
