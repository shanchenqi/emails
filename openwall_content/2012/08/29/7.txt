To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: [icinga-web] rmtmp-files.sh  Hi all,   Icinga-web (icinga.org)  I have found rmtmp-files.sh being called from the Makefile. This only works, if it will either be piped trough sh or the variable RMTMP_FORCE is set. Neither is the case. But, there is still a bug in the script.  ls foo.bak  important.nak  rmtmp-files.sh sh -x rmtmp-files.sh ". -iname *.nak -o" + PATTERN='-iname .DS_Store -o -iname Thumbs.db -o \ -iname *~ -o -iname ._* -o -iname *.bak' + ACTION=-print + DIR='. -iname *.nak -o' ++ find . -iname important.nak -o -iname .DS_Store -o \ -iname Thumbs.db -o -iname '*~' -o -iname '._*' -o -iname foo.bak + for F in '`find $DIR $PATTERN`' + REPLY= + [[ ! -n '' ]] + echo -n 'Delete ./important.nak' Delete ./important.nak+ [[ -n '' ]] + [[ -n '' ]] + [[ '' == \y ]] + for F in '`find $DIR $PATTERN`' + REPLY= + [[ ! -n '' ]] + echo -n 'Delete ./foo.bak' Delete ./foo.bak+ [[ -n '' ]] + [[ -n '' ]] + [[ '' == \y ]] + exit 0  Testing for $1 as a directory should somehow fix this.
