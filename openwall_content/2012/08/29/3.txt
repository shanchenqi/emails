This can cause _objalloc_alloc to return a pointer to a memory region which is smaller than expected.  The pointer alignment arithmetic in the objalloc_alloc macro misses an overflow check as well, with similar consequences.  GCC bug:   Patch under review:   (I believe GCC has the master copy of this file, but does not use it itself.  libiberty is part of binutils and GDB, too.)
