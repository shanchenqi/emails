A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted URL that,   when visited could lead to local file system traversal or,   potentially, ability to read content of any local file,   accessible with the privileges of the user running the webserver.    References:   [1]   [2]    Upstream patch:   [3]    Issue #B:   ---------   Then there is a report about non-persistent XSS flaw, that have been   fixed in the contrib module of version too:   [4]    but I was unable to find the relevant upstream patch (and above Debian BTS   entry doesn't contain further information too, which could be acted upon).    Thus I am Cc-in GeSHi upstream to this post to shed the light on the XSS flaw [4].      Ben, Nigel, could you please clarify what was the relevant upstream patch for the   Debian / Non-persistent XSS vulnerability in contrib script [4] issue?   Thank you for that, Jan.  Kurt, once the second issue clarified, could you allocate CVE ids for these?
