Vulnerable subcomponent: TYPO3 Backend Help System Vulnerability Type: Insecure Unserialize leading to a possible Arbitrary Code Execution Severity: Medium Suggested CVSS v2.0: AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:P/I:C/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C (What's that?) Problem Description: Due to a missing signature (HMAC) for a parameter in the view_help.php file, an attacker could unserialize arbitrary objects within TYPO3. We are aware of a working exploit, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. A valid backend user login or multiple successful cross site request forgery attacks are required to exploit this vulnerability. Solution: Update to the TYPO3 version or that fix the problem described! Credits: Credits go to Felix Wilhelm who discovered and reported the issue.   2.  Vulnerable subcomponent: TYPO3 Backend Vulnerability Type: Cross-Site Scripting Severity: Medium Suggested CVSS v2.0: AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C (What's that?) Problem Description: Failing to properly HTML-encode user input in several places, the TYPO3 backend is susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting. A valid backend user is required to exploit these vulnerabilities. Solution: Update to the TYPO3 version or that fix the problem described! Credits: Credits go to Pavel Vaysband, Security Team Member Markus Bucher, Core Team Member Susanne Moog, Jan Bednarik,  who discovered and reported the issues.  3.  Vulnerable subcomponent: TYPO3 Backend Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure Severity: Low Suggested CVSS v2.0: AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C (What's that?) Problem Description: Accessing the configuration module discloses the Encryption Key. A valid backend user with access to the configuration module is required to exploit this vulnerability. Solution: Update to the TYPO3 version or that fix the problem described! Credits: Credits go to Mario Rimann who discovered and reported the issue.  4.  Vulnerable subcomponent: TYPO3 HTML Sanitizing API Vulnerability Type: Cross-Site Scripting Severity: Medium Suggested CVSS v2.0: AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N/E:U/RL:O/RC:C (What's that?) Problem Description: By not removing several HTML5 JavaScript events, the API method t3lib_div::RemoveXSS() fails to filter specially crafted HTML injections, thus is susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting. Failing to properly encode for JavaScript the API method t3lib_div::quoteJSvalue(), it is susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting. Note: Developers should never rely on the blacklist of RemoveXSS() alone, but should always properly encode user input before outputting it again. Solution: Update to the TYPO3 version or that fix the problem described! Credits: Credits go to Andreas Schnapp and Christian Nรถsterer who discovered and reported the issues.  5.  Vulnerable subcomponent: TYPO3 Install Tool Vulnerability Type: Cross-Site Scripting Severity: Low Suggested CVSS v2.0: AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C (What's that?) Problem Description: Failing to properly sanitize user input, the Install Tool is susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting. Solution: Update to the TYPO3 version or that fix the problem described! Credits: Credits go to Security Team Member Georg Ringer who discovered and reported the issue.
