Red Hat reference: >  Thanks!  I'm happy to share the patches that I have for the Debian package if Red Hat would also like to use them.  They're somewhat different than upstream (or, rather, I had to layer additional patches on top of upstream) because Debian adds support for the new rsync protocol flags and for svnserve as a supported program, which required changes to the patch.  --  Russ Allbery (rra@...nford.edu)             <http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/>  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
