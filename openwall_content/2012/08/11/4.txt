I'm not sure if this is the place to report vulnerabilities in Macintosh software, but Tunnel Blick is open source.  >From the bug report [1] on the vulnerable code [2]:  1. A race condition in file permissions checking can lead to local root. (PoC: [3])  2. Insufficient checking of merely 0:0 can lead to local root on systems with particular configurations.  3. Insufficient validation of path names can allow for arbitrary kernel module loading, which can lead to local root.  4. Insufficient validation of path names can allow execution of arbitrary scripts as root, leading to local root. (PoC: [4])  5. Insufficient path validation in errorExitIfAttackViaString can lead to deletion of files as root, leading to DoS.  6. Allowing OpenVPN to run with user given configurations can lead to local root.
