Though I tested and reproduced this flaw only with the Debian packages, an ownCloud developer confirmed that this bug is not Debian-specific.  It is possible for regular users of owncloud to overwrite files that are shared read-only by another owncloud user via WebDAV.  To reproduce I did the following steps on Debian sid/unstable and also wheezy/testing:      1. Install owncloud packages      2. Open http://localhost/owncloud and finish installation by         creating an admin user      3. Log in as admin user and create two regular users user1 and         user2      4. Log into owncloud as user1 and create an empty text file      5. Share this file to user2 and leave the "can edit" checkbox         unchecked as it is by default      6. Log in via WebDAV as user2 (I used nautilus of GNOME 3)      7. Navigate to the empty file, open, edit and save it      8. user1's once empty file now contains the changes from user2  If version control is activated in ownCloud, user1 could revert the file to its previous state, but if it's *not* activated, user1's data is lost.  I contacted an ownCloud developer who sent me a patch, that was applied to their development branch to address this issue. I had to adjust it a little to make it apply against ownCloud in Debian sid/unstable. The patch should now be included in the latest Debian sid/unstable owncloud package. I attach the adjusted patch to this mail.
