Assuming that upstream is probably not likely to stop ignoring these requests, I wonders what would be the least bad approach to this CVE wise.  Apparently, if anyone needs to backport any of this and don't want to risk using wrong Oracle id because of an incorrect guess, I think the only way to to request new "public" CVE for these issues. Rather obvious drawback of such approach is that several CVEs are likely to be duplicated, or even triplicated (it's possible that and are for the same thing, but neither of them can be mapped to bug  Steven, can you think of any least damaging approach from the CVE point of view?
