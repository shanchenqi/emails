Surely this should be enumerating the modes that are safe, rather than the modes that are not safe? With that patch, if a new value for $mode is added, it's assumed to be a read operation. It seems much safer to assume that unknown modes are writes:      switch ($mode) {         case 'r':         case 'rb':             break;         default:             if (!$this->is_writable($path)) {                 return false;             }     }  Regards,     S  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
