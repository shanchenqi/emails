I am unable to see it myself, it appears that you are using an eval function to evaluate code which isn't exactly a security issue.  research <research@...ctionis.co.uk>  Summary =======  There is an arbitrary command execution vulnerability in the scriptfu network server console in the GIMP 2.6 branch. It is possible to use a python scriptfu command to run arbitrary operating-system commands and potentially take full control of the host.  The advisory is posted here: http://www.reactionpenetrationtesting.co.uk/GIMP-scriptfu-python-command-exe <http://www.reactionpenetrationtesting.co.uk/GIMP-scriptfu-python-command-ex e%0d%0acution.html>  cution.html  CVE number: Vendor homepage: http://www.gimp.org/ Vendor notified:   Affected Products =================  GIMP 2.6 branch (Windows or Linux builds)  Non-Affected Products =====================  The Scriptfu network server component does not currently work in the GIMP 2.8 branch (Windows or Linux builds).  Details =======  There is an arbitrary command execution vulnerability in the scriptfu network server console in the GIMP 2.6 branch. It is possible to use a python scriptfu command to run arbitrary operating-system commands and potentially take full control of the host. The following command will write "foo" to "/tmp/owned":  (python-fu-eval 0 "file = open('/tmp/owned','w')\nfile.write('foo')")   Impact ======  Successful exploitation of the vulnerability may result in remote command execution.  Solution =========== No solution has been implemented at this stage apart from the workaround below.  Workaround ===========  Do not enable the scriptfu network server. The GIMP development team have stated that this component was not designed with security  in mind and therefore should not be used in production environments.
