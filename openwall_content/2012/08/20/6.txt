A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted PSD image file that, when opened in Gimp would lead to PSD plug-in crash or, potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running gimp executable.  Note: A different flaw than  CVSSv2: 6.8/AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P  Affected versions: X <=                    Newer versions (gimp-v2.6.X, gimp-v2.8.X, master) are not affected                    by this issue.
