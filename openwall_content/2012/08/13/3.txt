Sorry maybe it's just late but I'm not finding any links to the vulnerable code/fixed code which makes it difficult to verify these issues. If you could put links to the affected code/lines so I can quickly verify that would be helpful. E.g. I might need to merge some of these (#3 and #4 and #5 for example are all input validation?).  > Thanks, Jason >  > [1] [2] > > >  [3] http://git.zx2c4.com/Pwnnel-Blicker/tree/pwnnel-blicker.c > [4] > http://git.zx2c4.com/Pwnnel-Blicker/tree/pwnnel-blicker-for-kids.sh > >  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org/  =D+SB -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
