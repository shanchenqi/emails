The session implementation comes with crypto-based cookie encryption that support PyCrypto, pycryptopp, and now NSS crypto.  Prior to this release, an attacker could possibly determine some content of cookie-based sessions encrypted with PyCrypto due to how the data was encrypted. This flaw did not affect pycryptopp sessions, nor does it allow an attacker to change data as a separate HMAC is used to sign the encrypted payload. Red Hat found and supplied a patch to fix this flaw, thanks!  Fix in beaker:  Applying this update will change the hashing of sessions encrypted with PyCrypto, invalidating existing ones.  Changelog for this release:  * Fix bug with key_length not being coerced to a int for comparison. Patch by   Greg Lavallee. * Fix bug with cookie invalidation not clearing the cookie data. Patch by   Vasiliy Lozovoy. * Added ability to pass in cookie_path for the Session. Patch by Marcin   Kuzminski. * Add NSS crypto support to Beaker. Patch by Miloslav Trmac of Redhat. * Fix security bug with pycrypto not securing data such that an attacker could   possibly determine parts of the encrypted payload. Patch by Miloslav Trmac of   Redhat. See * Add ability to specify schema for database-backed sessions. Patch by Vladimir   Tananko. * Fix issue with long key names in memcached backend. Patch by Guillaume   Taglang.   Cheers, Ben Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
