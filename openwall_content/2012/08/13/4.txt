Myers" <joseph@...esourcery.com>, Jeff Law <law@...hat.com> Subject: CVE Request -- glibc: Integer overflows, leading to stack-based  buffer overflows in strto* related routines  Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,    multiple integer overflows, leading to stack-based buffer overflows were found in various stdlib functions of GNU libc (strtod, strtof, strtold, strtod_l and related routines). If an application, using the affected stdlib functions, did not perform user-level sanitization of provided inputs, a local attacker could use this flaw to cause such an application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.  Upstream bug report: [1]  Upstream patch (might not be the final one): [2]  References: [3]  Could you allocate a CVE id for this?
