This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier  Versions Affected:  3.x. Not affected:       2.3.x Fixed Versions:      Impact - ------ When a "prompt" value is supplied to the `select_tag` helper, the "prompt" value is not escaped.  If untrusted data is not escaped, and is supplied as the prompt value, there is a potential for XSS attacks.  Vulnerable code will look something like this:      select_tag("name", options, :prompt => UNTRUSTED_INPUT)  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the work arounds immediately.  Releases - -------- The and releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds - -----------  A possible workaround for this vulnerability is to escape user input supplied to the prompt key:      select_tag("name", options, :prompt => h(UNTRUSTED_INPUT))   Patches - ------- To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series.  They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.  * 3-0-select_tag_prompt.patch - Patch for 3.0 series * 3-1-select_tag_prompt.patch - Patch for 3.1 series * 3-2-select_tag_prompt.patch - Patch for 3.2 series  Please note that only the 3.1.x and 3.2.x series are supported at present.  Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.  ---  Santiago Pastorino WyeWorks Co-founder http://www.wyeworks.com  Twitter: http://twitter.com/spastorino Github: http://github.com/spastorino  Download attachment "3-2-select_tag_prompt.patch" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment "3-1-select_tag_prompt.patch" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment "3-0-select_tag_prompt.patch" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
