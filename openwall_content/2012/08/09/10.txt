This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier  Versions Affected:  All. Not affected:       None Fixed Versions:      Impact - ------ The HTML escaping code in Ruby on Rails does not escape all potentially dangerous characters.  In particular the code does not escape the single quote character.  The helpers used in Rails itself never use single quotes, so most applications are unlikely to be vulnerable, however all users running an affected release should still upgrade.  Releases - -------- The and releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds - -----------  For users on earlier releases or who are unable to upgrade, you can install the attached file into config/initializers.  This will upgrade the rails helper to use the Rack::Utils.escape_html helper which does escape the single quote character.  However the Rack helper also escapes the '/' character, this is likely to cause test failures if your application is expecting the values of URLs to be unencoded. These tests however browsers will correctly decode the values and function as expected.  Patches - ------- To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series.  They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.  * 3-0-escape_html.patch - Patch for 3.0 series * 3-1-escape_html.patch - Patch for 3.1 series * 3-2-escape_html.patch - Patch for 3.2 series  Please note that only the 3.1.x and 3.2.x series are supported at present.  Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.  ---  Santiago Pastorino WyeWorks Co-founder http://www.wyeworks.com  Twitter: http://twitter.com/spastorino Github: http://github.com/spastorino  Download attachment "single_quote_escape_workaround.rb" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment "3-2-escape_html.patch" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment "3-1-escape_html.patch" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment "3-0-escape_html.patch" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
