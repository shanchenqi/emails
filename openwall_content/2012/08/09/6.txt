A shadow connection represents a connection to another broker in the cluster. Members use shadow connections to simulate the actions of other brokers, so that all members arrive at the same time. Output for shadow connections is just discarded, brokers only send data to their directly-connected clients.  A security flaw was found in the way the Qpid C++ libraries implementation, used by AMQP client applications to exchange messages with an AMQP message broker using the AMQP protocol, performed authentication for certain shadow connections. An AMQP client application could issue a phoney shadow connection to the AMQP broker, leading into situation that AMQP broker to consider the connection it to be a legitimate connection from another AMQP broker, subsequently using NullAuthenticator mechanism for authentication, allowing the AMQP client application to bypass the authentication.   This has been assigned the name  References:   Also, as a aide note, this affects (possibly Red Hat-specific naming convention) the qpid-cpp-server-cluster package, other qpid packages  are not affected.  --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
