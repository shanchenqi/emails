ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  An HVM guest is able to manipulate its physical address space such that tearing down the guest takes an extended period amount of time searching for shared pages.  This causes the domain 0 VCPU which tears down the domain to be blocked in the destroy hypercall. This causes that domain 0 VCPU to become unavailable and may cause the domain 0 kernel to panic.  There is no requirement for memory sharing to be in use.  IMPACT ======  A guest kernel can cause the host to become unresponsive for a period of time, potentially leading to a DoS.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All systems running HVM guests with untrusted guest kernels.  This vulnerability effects only Xen 4.0 and 4.1. Xen 3.4 and earlier and xen-unstable are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  This issue can be mitigated by running PV (para-virtualised) guests only, or by ensuring (inside the guest) that the kernel is trustworthy.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch will resolve the issue.  NOTE REGARDING CVE ==================  We do not yet have a CVE Candidate number for this vulnerability.  PATCH INFORMATION =================  The attached patches resolve this issue   Xen 4.1, 4.1.x                               Xen 4.0, 4.0.x                               $ xsa11-*.patch   -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =l4LY -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  View attachment of type "text/plain" bytes)  View attachment of type "text/plain" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
