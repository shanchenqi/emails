When attempting to update a user's default tenant, Keystone will only partially deny the request when a user is not authorized to complete this action. The API responds with Not Authorized and the user's default tenant is not changed. However, the user is still granted membership to this new tenant.The result is that any client that can reach the administrative API (deployed on port by default) can add any user to any tenant.  Fixes: Folsom:  References:  Notes: This fix will be included in the folsom-rc1 development milestone and in a future Essex release.  - --  Russell Bryant OpenStack Vulnerability Management Team -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://www.enigmail.net/  =vdh7 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
