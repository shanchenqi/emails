See:  If a security boundary is crossed then yup. E.g. you can monkey with the programs log files/config/etc. (cover up attacks/etc.) or possibly crash the program/cause a dos (forcing it to append/process huge files, etc.). Alternatively you can use the directory to stash files (and typically the admin only expects /tmp/, /var/tmp/) and so on.  >  > >  > and I guess there might be more to come since it's the result of  > piuparts tests run against the whole archive.  Basically it's a lot like /tmp/ file creation issues. They are low level, rarely fatal, but they are security issues that need to be addressed. I'll do separate emails for them to make tracking easier.  > Regards, >    - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org/  =t7K3 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
