Is there a good > reason why CVE mapping for public issues can not be provided?  July CPU does not mention any of the CVEs that were previously mentioned here.   Judging from the CVSS scores, (password checking issue) is not duplicated by any CVE listed.  This does not sound too surprising, as it's quite likely no Oracle MySQL build was really affected by this flaw, which would explain why this may have not been treated as security for binary packages.  There does not seem to be any obvious explanation why and are not listed.  It's quite possible they are duplicates of or covered by (as it seems some CVEs refer to more than one issue) and respectively.  Looking at the issue that affected 5.1 versions and going through the change between affected and fixed versions, it seems CVEs form the CPU refer to the following issues:   CPU -----------  GIS Extension  - ISCLOSED() CRASHES ON 64-BIT BUILDS  - CRASH WHEN SUBSELECTING GLOBAL VARIABLES IN GEOMETRY FUNCTION ARGUMENTS   Server Optimizer  FAILING ASSERTION: CURSOR->POS_STATE == (BTR_PCUR_IS_POSITIONE CRASH ON SELECT SUBQUERY WITH NON UNIQUE INDEX ->  VALUES() IN A SELECT STATEMENT CRASHES SERVER  CRASH IN DTCOLLATION::SET(DTCOLLATION &SET)   Server Optimizer -> dupe of / overlaps with  EXTENDED, PREPARED STATEMENT, CRASH IN CHECK_SIMPLE_EQUALITY   +++++++++++   CPU -----------  Server Optimizer  Bug SERVER THREAD HANGS WHEN JOIN + WHERE + GROUP BY IS EXECUTED TWICE FROM P   MyISAM  CRASH WHEN "LOAD INDEX INTO CACHE" WITH TOO SMALL KEY CACHE   Server DML  SERVER CRASH ON HANDLER READ NEXT AFTER DELETE RECORD ->   Server Optimizer  SP DEAD CODE REMOVAL DOESN'T UNDERSTAND CONTINUE HANDLERS   Oracle security team, please confirm the mapping above if it's correct, or provide corrections.
