If the write permissions cannot be restricted to a user or group, the sticky bit should be set on the directory to prevent users from manipulating files they don't own.   Andreas   Please use for this issue.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org/  iQIcBAEBAgAGBQJQHBMhAAoJEBYNRVNeJnmTEwQP/3LeBbxnOOJieArdbEkJPZZg PhFZegy/eLjRaLfO2ao5 =JAx5 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
