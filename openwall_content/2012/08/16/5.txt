We definitely want  to avoid duplicates or triplicates as much as possible.  I of course don't speak for Oracle, but they are generally reluctant to  comment on CVE mappings or exploit details in any public forum (although  they have privately provided CVEs to the original researchers if asked).  I will discuss this issue with them using existing CVE communication  channels, but I'm not sure when I will have an answer or clarification  that resolves this complicated interaction between open source and closed  source philosophies.  Meanwhile, I will ensure that we have updates for the already-assigned  CVEs that are not covered in Oracle CPUs, and note the *potential*  duplicates in the descriptions, along with the usual statement that  emphasizes that Oracle has not commented.  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
