MyBB search.php keywords Parameter SQL Injection  MyBB contains a flaw that may allow an attacker to carry out an SQL injection attack. The issue is due to the search.php script not properly sanitizing user-supplied input to the keywords parameter. This may allow an attacker to inject or manipulate SQL queries in the back-end database, allowing for the manipulation or disclosure of arbitrary data."""  Reference: Advisory:  2. MyBB private.php keywords Parameter SQL Injection  MyBB contains a flaw that may allow an attacker to carry out an SQL injection attack. The issue is due to the private.php script not properly sanitizing user-supplied input to the keywords parameter. This may allow an attacker to inject or manipulate SQL queries in the back-end database, allowing for the manipulation or disclosure of arbitrary data.  Reference: Advisory:  Both fixed in same reporter but different php-file so do we want to merge these or should there be two CVEs?
