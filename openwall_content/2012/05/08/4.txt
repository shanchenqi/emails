Since it is generally safe to echo back  contents of a request, this can allow an attacker to get an otherwise  correctly designed server to divulge information about other requests. It is  theoretically possible that it could enable header-spoofing attacks, though  such an attack has not been demonstrated."  Fix:  Thanks, Alex  --  Alex Legler <a3li@...too.org> Gentoo Security/Ruby/Infrastructure  Download attachment "signature.asc " of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
