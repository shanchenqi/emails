This flaw could potentially be exploited by a remote attacker to cause arbitrary code to be executed on the user's machine.  The flaw is in pidgin-otr, not in libotr.  Other applications which use libotr are not affected.  has been assigned to this issue.  The recommended course of action is to upgrade pidgin-otr to version immediately.  The new version can be obtained here:  Windows installer:     gpg signature:      Windows zip file:     gpg signature:      Source code:     gpg signature:      git repository:     git://otr.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/otr/pidgin-otr (branch 3.2_dev)  Version (soon to be released) does not suffer from this flaw.  Linux and *BSD vendors and package maintainers have been notified, and updated packages should be available from them.  If upgrading to version is not possible, please apply the following patch to   - --- a/otr-plugin.c +++ b/otr-plugin.c @@ @@ static void still_secure_cb(void *opdata, ConnContext *conte    static void log_message_cb(void *opdata, const char *message)  { - -    purple_debug_info("otr", message); +    purple_debug_info("otr", "%s", message);  }    static int max_message_size_cb(void *opdata, ConnContext *context)    Our heartfelt thanks to intrigeri <intrigeri@...m.org> for finding and alerting us to this flaw.
