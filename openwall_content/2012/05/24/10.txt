But when a program with much more limited operations doesn't drop privileges, unless it directly leads to some sort of exploit/elevated access/etc. than I'm inclined to say while it's not good, it's not a vulnerability per se.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org/  =dDuN -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
