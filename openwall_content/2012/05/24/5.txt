These are of course my personal opinions, any mistakes/errors are mine entirely and so on.  Dropping of the primary user and group privileges is a well known security feature in many programs (e.g. bind, dhcp, apache, etc.). The idea being programs need root to bind to privileged ports/etc. But once done don't need root access. I think clearly in this case if a program is running as root, and claims to give up root privileges but fails to, that is a security issue and worthy of a CVE. In the case where a program does NOT drop privileges, and this feature has now been added (and assuming it works), I think this qualifies as security hardening, not a security fix and NOT worthy of a CVE.  Now it gets messy. What about the dropping of supplementary groups?  Supplemental groups enabled a user to be a member of more than one group at a time (us old timers remember the joys of "newgrp"). Why would anyone want this? You could for example create a group that has permissions to access logging, terminals (e.g. modems, remember those? =) and then add users to it as appropriate (and centralize account/permissions management somewhat and all that good stuff).  So what happens when a program starts running as say root, and root has supplemental groups (like "bin" or "daemon" and the program drops its primary user/group but fails to drop supplementary groups, is that a security issue, and is it worthy of a CVE identifier?  For most cases I'm going to say probably not (aka no). Having supplementary groups is intentional and allows permissions to be more fine grained, you can for example make root a member of "logging" so that even when the app drops root privileges would still have the supplementary group of "logging" and can do its logging or whatever.  So unless someone makes a compelling argument that these are security issues I'm going to err on the side of "security hardening" instead of "security fix" for dropping supplementary groups, but of course not all issues are the same so if you have a specific issue and think it deserves a CVE make a case on OSS-sec.  * Should these issues be fixed? yes. Dropping privileges where possible is usually a good idea, until things break though and then people start disabling things like SELinux or running everything as root to "make it work" :P.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org/  1jkfJxJyNMowHJx3/nJH =6ZUw -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
