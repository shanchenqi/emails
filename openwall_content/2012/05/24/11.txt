It's a case of a security feature not working as intended.  Previously, CVEs were sometimes assigned and sometimes not in such cases, and I failed to see a pattern in that. ;-)  Consider e.g. ("it is believed that this issue is only exploitable by leveraging vulnerabilities in the unprivileged process, which are not known to exist").  Are you maybe trying to draw the line between "security feature" and "security hardening"?  Even if so, I fail to see how OpenSSH's privsep is more of a "security feature", whereas another daemon's dropping of root privs is "security hardening".  These look very similar to me in terms of what they're intended and expected to achieve, so I think it's the same category, whatever we call it.  Now, I imagine there could be a subtle case if e.g. a downstream distro or a fork of a project introduces privilege dropping, which is not in the main code base, and there turns out to be a flaw in that, which weakens the added security (but not to the point of being worse than the original).  It would feel a bit weird to say that the hardened revision is vulnerable whereas the original is not, even though the original is not any safer.  In such cases, I guess whether this is CVE-worthy or not will depend on whether the added hardening was advertised to and expected by users/admins of the hardened revision or not.  If it was an undocumented extra, then it failing to improve things is probably not what people would expect to be tracked as a security vulnerability. However, if it was documented and expected to function, then it becomes a vulnerability to track just like any other one of similar severity.  I hope this helps.
