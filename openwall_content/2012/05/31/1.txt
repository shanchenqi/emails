A crafted msg to the   script-fu server overflows a buffer and overwrites several function pointers   allowing the attacker to gain control of EIP and potentially execute arbitrary   code. This issue is fixed in the latest, stable GIMP version (currently     CVE number:  Impact: high  Vendor Homepage: http://www.gimp.org/  Date found:  Found by: Joseph Sheridan of Reaction Information Security  Homepage: http://www.reactionpenetrationtesting.co.uk     This advisory is posted at:  http://www.reactionpenetrationtesting.co.uk/advisories/scriptfu-buffer-overf low-GIMP-2.6.html     PoC Code is available here:  http://www.reactionpenetrationtesting.co.uk/advisories/scriptfubof.c     Affected Products  =================     Vulnerable Products  +------------------     The following products are known to be affected by this vulnerability:       * GIMP <= (Windows or Linux builds)     Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable  +--------------------------------     The following products are known not to be affected by this  vulnerability:       * GIMP (current stable release)     Details  =======     There is a buffer overflow in the command parsing code such that a long command  overwrites various function pointers on the heap and gives the attacker full control   of EIP. The following command sent to the script-fu server will trigger the   vulnerability:     (file-bmp-load   raw-filename)     Impact  ======     Successful exploitation of the vulnerability may result in remote code execution.     Solution  ===========  Upgrade to the latest stable version of GIMP (currently 2.8 branch) - the 2.6 branch is   no longer supported by the GIMP development team.     Workarounds  ===========     A workaround would be not to use this feature on a vulnerable version of GIMP.  The GIMP development team have strongly suggested only using the   script-fu network server in a secure/sandboxed environment due to   security concerns.     Updates  ============     Future updates of this advisory, if any, will be placed on the ReactionIS  corporate website, but may or may not be actively announced on  mailing lists or newsgroups.
