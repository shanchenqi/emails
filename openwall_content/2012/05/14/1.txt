The code behind the system is freely available, and it  is widely used by at least one hosting company.  The code  itself is available, along with documentation, here:      http://symbiosis.bytemark.co.uk/    Unfortunately releases between these two mercurial  identifiers contained a significant flaw:    mercurial ID:     date:        Wed Feb 01    And    changeset:     date:        Thu May 10     IMAP/POP3/SMTP authentication would accept any password  for any valid email account.  (Logins are of the form  $user@...main.)    This was fixed with the following commit:         Please could a CVE identifier be allocated such that we  may use it in our documentation.
