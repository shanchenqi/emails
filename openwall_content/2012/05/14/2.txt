Successful   exploitation may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with   the privileges of the socat process.  Vulnerability Id:  Details   This vulnerability can be exploited when socat is invoked with the   READLINE address (this is usually only used interactively) without   option "prompt" and without option "noprompt" and an attacker   succeeds to provide malicious data to the other (arbitrary) address   that is then transferred by socat to the  READLINE address for   output.   The problem was caused by a coding error in function   xioscan_readline().  Testcase   To check your socat program do the following:      perl -e 'print "\r"."A"x >/tmp/socat-data     socat readline exec:'cat /tmp/socat-data'    When socat crashes with a signal (e.g. SIGSEGV) and does not output   any 'A' it is vulnerable.  Workaround   Use option "prompt" or option "noprompt" with the READLINE address.
