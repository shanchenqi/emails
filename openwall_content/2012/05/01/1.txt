This test case suggests to me that you have to specify the list of encrypted columns explicitly:  <http://elixir.ematia.de/trac/browser/elixir/trunk/tests/test_encryption.py>  Based on this example, it's not clear to me if the current implementation supports get_by with an encrypted column.  If this is a feature which needs preserving, there is no apparent way around convergent encryption.
