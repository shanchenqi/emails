The severity of this is quite high, its a default remote root exploit, as connman is requesting hostname per dhcp by default and not checking for shell escapes. (I did not check whether they clean any other strings that could appear and could contain newlines etc. when its written to a config file)  >  > 3) DHCPv6 option parsing vulnerable to DoS (endless loop): >    (from >  >    with patches: >    There doesn't seem to be upstream patches for this yet.

Upstream needs to verify/confirm these, but I think its a real bug that lets you overwrite files.
