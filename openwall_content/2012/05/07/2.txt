The one that I am missing is related to the GKeyFile/VPN settings storage. I did not review the patches itself, except checking them slightly. The bug report is here:   It was not a full review, so some parts remain unchecked.  Some dists seem to ship it and before it goes the wicd way, I'd rather ask for CVE's myself.
