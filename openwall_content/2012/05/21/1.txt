Fixed via in mainline:   commit   Author: Xi Wang <xi.wang@...il.com>   Date:   Mon Apr 23      fix integer overflow in      On 32-bit systems, a large args->buffer_count from userspace via ioctl     may overflow the allocation size, leading to out-of-bounds access.      This vulnerability was introduced in commit     First try a normal large kmalloc for the temporary exec buffers").     was added Feb 21 and seemingly added during development.   2. same file, overflow in args->buffer_count.     Fix is in mainline     commit    Author: Xi Wang <xi.wang@...il.com>    Date:   Mon Apr 23      fix integer overflow in      On 32-bit systems, a large args->num_cliprects from userspace via ioctl     may overflow the allocation size, leading to out-of-bounds access.      This vulnerability was introduced in commit Avoid     allocation for execbuffer object list").      was added during development.   I think it needs 2 CVEs, due to the different kernel versions introducing it.
