Description:  By default, phpMyFAQ installs with a default password. An unspecified account has an unspecified password which is publicly known and documented. This allows attackers to trivially access the program or system and gain privileged access.  http://www.phpmyfaq.de/changelog.php  Is there a general CVE-identifier for issues like default password, which I think would be OK in case like this? If user upgraded installation from old version to new this was not fixed in the process.  - Henri Salo  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
