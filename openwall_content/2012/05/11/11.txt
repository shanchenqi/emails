In versions before if configuration option "allow_missing_dns" is set to no, it performs no blocking. This setting is used in the example configuration file, which is installed by default in Debian. Thus, systems using the suggested or default configuration receive no protection.  This vulnerability provides no vector for an attacker, local or remote, to gain any privileges. It simply fails to provide the intended protection.  Mainline fix: Debian bug report and fix:  Vulnerable versions: mainline up to and including Debian up to and including First fixed versions: mainline Debian  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
