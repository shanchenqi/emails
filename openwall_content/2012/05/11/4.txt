DTLS applications are affected in all versions of OpenSSL. TLS is only affected in OpenSSL and later.  Thanks to Codenomicon for discovering this issue using Fuzz-o-Matic fuzzing as a service testing platform.  The fix was developed by Stephen Henson of the OpenSSL core team.  Affected users should upgrade to OpenSSL or  References ==========  URL for this Security Advisory:   -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =/mgW -----END PGP SIGNATURE----- ______________________________________________________________________ OpenSSL Project                                 http://www.openssl.org Announcement Mailing List                 openssl-announce@...nssl.org Automated List Manager                           majordomo@...nssl.org  ----- End forwarded message -----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
