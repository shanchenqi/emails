Without not to leak too much, Daniel also clarified this problem would be of higher impact / security relevance for Google Chrome instances due the way they use XPointer functionality. On common Linux libxml2 instances additional functionality to be involved is needed this to be exploited in that way as it has been for Google Chrome case.  Hope this helps. Let us know if we can be of any further advice.
