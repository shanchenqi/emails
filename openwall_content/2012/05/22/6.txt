A remote atttacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (mosh server to  enter long for loop when trying to process the paramaters) via specially-crafted escape sequence string.  Upstream ticket: [3]  Relevant upstream patch: [4]  References: [5] [6]  Could you allocate a CVE id for this? (issue confirmed by mosh upstream)  B) vte issue: =============  there is similar issue in vte too (Gnome bug private for now):  Cc-ed Behdad Esfahbod on this post to clarify, what are the upstream plans regarding this report in vte and if the CVE id has been already assigned for it.
