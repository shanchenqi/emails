Security issue reporters are usually not held responsible for reporting the issues that they find to every affected distribution themselves.  That is why common id numbers (CVEs) are important.  They give us a common reference for every problem.  Then its the job of those of us representing such distributions to pass the information on to the appropriate tracking systems within our own focus areas.
