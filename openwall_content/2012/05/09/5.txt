When the tcpmux-server service is enabled, xinetd would expose _all_ enabled services via the tcpmux port, instead of just the configured service(s). This could allow a remote attacker to bypass firewall restrictions and access services via the tcpmux port.  In order for enabled services handled by xinetd to be exposed via the tcpmux port, the tcpmux-server service must be enabled (by default it is disabled).  This has been assigned  Thomas Swan also provided a patch [2], which has been reviewed by a former xinetd upstream maintainer and the Red Hat xinetd maintainer (upstream didn't respond to our contact attempts).  -- References --  [1] Red Hat bug:  [2] Proposed patch:  Thanks and kind regards, --  Stefan Cornelius / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
