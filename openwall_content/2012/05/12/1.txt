This contravenes the relevant standards [0], which indicate that the data within a multipart/signed MIME part needs to be treated by any MTA as opaque.  I don't know who updates ezmlm these days, but that probably needs to be addressed if there's an expectation that people should be able to send cryptographically-signed messages with non-ASCII text to the list.  	--dkg  [0]  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
