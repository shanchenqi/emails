I also briefly looked into it yesterday.  My guess is that the issue might have been triggered by the rather unusual MIME section boundary strings ("=-=-=").  Maybe these are specific to Notmuch.  We had other signed messages in here, which got through to the list just fine.  For just one affected message in (total on this list so far), I think I am not going to bother to investigate this further and patch it.
