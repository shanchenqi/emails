This should be rejected as per the message two responses after the first reference above:   where Eugene says, based on the "this isn't a security flaw" message from Dan Rosenberg.  Can you add a "REJECT" or "DISPUTED" note or whatever?  This probably should have never been written up.  Thanks.  --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
