Many Piwik users don't upgrade and use  older vulnerable version, sometimes data leaking are possible. If we give the details, first of all it takes time and energy which is already booked, and secondly it would help black hat write bots to scrape and do bad.  This is not a good investment of our time sorry... but I appreciate your work :) Matt """  I do not think this is good way to improve security. In my opinion these issues still need CVE-identifiers, but details will limit to "unknown XSS" etc. Does these get three or one CVE-identifier?  - Henri Salo  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
