Linville            The water won't run clean until you get linville@...hat.com                       the pigs out of the creek.  ---</inline>---  Thus basically from the above, we wouldn't look at this one as a security flaw, because this is more question of proper configuration, rather than a real security flaw (the administrator needs in any case edit /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf it to suite their needs / their local wireless configuration before being able to use the hostapd service. And in that moment [when entering sensitive WPA information there], they should also change the permissions of the hostapd configuration it to be more secure / not readable by all local users).  Thus maybe something to be explicitly mentioned in the documentation (change permissions of the config file post update), but not a security flaw.  > but in the past similar > vulnerabilities got a CVE (e.g.   From and mainly from:  the passwords in this case were stored in plaintext in the database, which is something slightly different.
