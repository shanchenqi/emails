A flaw was reported in HAProxy where, due to a boundary error when copying data into the trash buffer, an external attacker could cause a buffer overflow.  Exploiting this flaw could lead to the execution of arbitrary code, however it requires non-default settings for the global.tune.bufsize configuration option (must be set to a value greater than the default), and also that header rewriting is enabled (via, for example, the regrep or rsprep directives).  This flaw is reported against prior versions may also be affected.  This has been fixed upstream in version and in git.
