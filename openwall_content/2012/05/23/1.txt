Yes, ideally you should include the CVE # where appropriate in ChangeLogs, NEWS files, web pages, email announcements, source code comments, etc. This will make tracking the issue easier, and allow vendors to quickly locate the vulnerable code, the code fix and so on.  In a perfect world a patch file labled something like linked from your security web page makes life really easy especially for vendors that backport security fixes (e.g. Red Hat) rather than rebasing to a newer version (e.g. Fedora).  > I don't want to butt in inappropriately, but I also don't want it > to seem (by our silence) like we agree with the description in the > CVE request.  Feel free to correct it =) Obviously the chances of getting an accurate description are much better if the vendor participates.  > The writeup is not accurate.
