OVERVIEW  Acuity CMS 2.6.x (ASP-based) versions are vulnerable to Path Traversal.   2. BACKGROUND  Acuity CMS is a powerful but simple, extremely easy to use, low priced, easy to deploy content management system. It is a leader in its price and feature class.   3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION  The issue is due to the script, /admin/file_manager/browse.asp, not properly sanitizing user input, specifically directory traversal style attacks (e.g., ../../) supplied via the 'path' parameter. It would allow the attacker to access arbitrary files outside of web root directory.   4. VERSIONS AFFECTED  Tested with version   5. PROOF-OF-CONCEPT/EXPLOIT  http://localhost/admin/file_manager/browse.asp?field=&form=&path=../../   6. SOLUTION  The Acunity CMS is no longer in active development. It is recommended to user another CMS in active development and support.   7. VENDOR  The Collective http://www.thecollective.com.au/   8.
