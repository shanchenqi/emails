This was triggered by regular network traffic happening, so attackers in the local network could inject such a packet.  The issue is apparently fixed in (oldest GIT revision of dhcpcd I can find), as it features the necessary checks on cursory review.   Problem is that the "to copyed" size of a packet is decoded from the network data and not checked against the maximum size of the retrieved packet.  In dhcpcd it is copied to a fixed size stackbuffer on some paths and so overwrites stack.  On our SLE11 product this is caught by -fstack-protector, turning this into a remote denial of service (crash).  Place to look for places like this:                  bytes = get_udp_data(&pp, packet);                 if ((size_t)bytes > sizeof(*dhcp)) {                         syslog(LOG_ERR,                             "%s: packet greater than DHCP size from %s",                             iface->name, inet_ntoa(from));                         continue;                 }  bytes is calculated from packet data and not bounded in get_udp_data(). So without the if() check, it would later copy over bytes into a fixed buffer in some paths.  Also:                 bytes = packet.bh_caplen - ETHER_HDR_LEN;                 if (bytes > len)                         bytes = len;                 memcpy(data, payload, bytes);  I have pasted the current patch we use against our quite heavily patches dhcpcd on  Reference:  Ciao, Marcus  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
