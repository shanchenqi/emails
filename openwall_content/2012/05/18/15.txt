This allows unprivileged persons to brute force the contents of presumably secret election ballots, and makes it possible to calculate the contents of secret voter ballots in all past debian elections.  Ideally, devotee should use a random secret moniker with fully 64 (or preferably bits that would require years rather than minutes or days to brute force [2].  The source also uses /dev/urandom, which has less entropy than /dev/random.  Please assign an id for this issue.
