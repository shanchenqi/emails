I accept the fact that "chatbubbles.xml" being a configuration file makes it harder to be replaced, but still there is a risk.  Thanks for the feedback,  Andres Gomez  Kurt Seifried <kseifried@...hat.com>  > -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- > Hash: SHA1 > > On PM, Andres Gomez wrote: > > Planeshift is an online multiplayer role playing game which is > > open source (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlaneShift_(video_game)) > > and "chatbubbles.xml" is a sort of configuration file for chat > > windows inside the game, so I can't be changed directly by remote > > users. > > It doesn't sounds like any security boundary is being crossed. > > If you can edit that file I'm guessing you can also modify the other > game files (executables, libraries, etc.), so there is no escalation > of privilege as far as I can tell.
