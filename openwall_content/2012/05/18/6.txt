If an application using the Tornado web framework accepted untrusted user input and based on that input updated the HTTP headers content (to redirect the user etc.), by providing a specially-crafted input a remote attacker could use this flaw to perform cross-site scripting attacks, cross-user defacement, web cache poisoning etc.  Upstream release changelog: [1]  References: [2] [3]  Could you allocate a CVE id for this? (should be one)  Thank you && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
