It doesn't sounds like any security boundary is being crossed.  If you can edit that file I'm guessing you can also modify the other game files (executables, libraries, etc.), so there is no escalation of privilege as far as I can tell. If the ifle is owned by a unique user (e.g. it's a local config thing) again, if you can edit a users files you already have access, so no escalation of privilege. If this is correct then I will not be assigning a CVE.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org/  dXWRpeRoRNhHO/dfQawV =Gbu8 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
