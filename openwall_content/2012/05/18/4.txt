In the case of Planeshift the chatbubbles.xml is not supplied by the user, it comes with the program and is installed into a system directory. This is very different from the TORCS situation. If you can convince a user to start replacing system config files than almost every program needs a CVE by that definition (I can think of a few hundred programs on Linux that have config files that result in other programs/script/commands being run that can be easily obfuscated to do nastiness).
