Can >we just remove it from there please?  Removing Comment 4 from is definitely a good idea, but MITRE will also do a REJECT of the identifier to address the issue more completely.  We often see vendors of CVE compatible products and services picking up new CVE mappings from oss-security postings, and from references cited in oss-security postings, and this often happens on the day of the posting. Some vendors primarily just want the mapping, and aren't really investigating the issues or possible discrepancies. So, here, it's plausible that:    1. Vendor already discovered the web page for "Bug - VUL-0:      kadu: allows to inject js code."    2. Vendor quickly skimmed the text of and saw "use      for this issue." Vendor did not bother to go to the      openssl-dev link, or even consider that openssl-dev is not a      common forum for discussing Kadu.    3. Vendor immediately jumped to the conclusion that is      assigned to the Kadu issue, and updated a data set that      ultimately gets pushed out to their customers.    4. Sometime in the future, their customer decides to look up      on the MITRE CVE web site.    4a. If is a regular CVE entry about an OpenSSL       vulnerability, the customer might reach any of a variety of       incorrect conclusions, especially because Kadu apparently uses       OpenSSL through the QCA OSSL plugin for libqca2. The customer       might, for example, infer that is an unpatched       vulnerability affecting the Kadu EncryptionNgPlugin component.    4b. If is a rejected CVE entry that points to the       correct CVE identifiers for the Kadu issue and the OpenSSL       issue, then there's probably more hope that the customer will       find the correct information.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/obtain_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =Ule+ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
