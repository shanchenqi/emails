A rogue repository server could use this flaw to modify window's title, or possibly execute arbitrary commands or overwrite files via a specially-crafted build log or build status output containing an escape sequence for a terminal emulator.  References: [1] [2]  I need to conclude, I don't know how OBS repositories work (if there is a chance of a rogue server being present). In any case, this issue is on the border (pretty unlikely someone could alter content of OBS package during build -- in that case there would be more urgent issues than just particular terminal window title change).  But strictly taken, the trust boundary is crossed in the moment, someone would schedule OBS build and wouldn't expect the build log / status can perform terminal "side" effect yet.  Marcus, please correct me if you don't agree this should get a CVE identifier.  If no one having objections and request appropriate, could you allocate one?
