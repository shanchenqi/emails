Unfortunately CVE only works as well as the vendors using it decide it will. A biased example: Red Hat provides links to security reports with details, bugzilla entries, code commit information, and so on. Vendors that fail or refuse to provide details/code commits for their Open Source projects and so on make things extremely difficult for users and other vendors. =( An example of this is the following blog entry:  http://blog.montyprogram.com/oracles-27-mysql-security-fixes-and-mariadb/  I'm not trying to pick on Oracle but this is topical and a perfect example of the problem(s) CVE was meant to address but can't if vendors don't participate in the process appropriately.  --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
