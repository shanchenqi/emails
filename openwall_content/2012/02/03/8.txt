I think this is something that should be discussed (I'm not specifically against Xen joining, but I'm worried about the precedent it might set). Many projects incorporate upstream software, if we lower the bar of entry in this respect we may get a lot more people on the list. This might not be a good idea (more chances of leaks/etc.).  My understanding of the way the vs security list is used is that upstream is typically notified (after all, they usually are the ones fixing the issue), and that people not on the list can post to the list to notify it of upcoming stuff (this happens all the time), we then CC them on communications about the issue they reported to keep them in the loop. For something this specific might it not be a better idea for Xen just go straight to the qemu project so they can be notified of the embargoed issues?    --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
