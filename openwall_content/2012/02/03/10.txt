I think not.  We had a few exceptions like this on vendor-sec, but when setting up the linux-distros list I proposed not to be making such exceptions anymore and everyone seemed to agree.  In fact, that's even reflected in the list name - on purpose.  Thanks for bringing the topic up anyway.  It helps to know what's in demand and see what solutions we have (or don't have).  > Although Xen.org is not a distro we do incorporate upstream software and > one of our upstreams (qemu) uses this list as their embargoed security > announcement channel.

I think they will start doing it if they don't mind.  And if they do mind, then it'd be inappropriate to bypass that.  Meanwhile, I've edited this wiki page:  http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros  to ask reporters to consider notifying not only distro vendors, but also affected Open Source projects (if applicable).  Specifically:  "If the security issue you're reporting affects other systems as well (from vendors not represented on these lists), please consider notifying other affected distro vendors and/or Open Source projects as well and mention what you're doing on this or what you'd like done on it in your notification to the list."  where "distro vendors" and "Open Source projects" are links to:  http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/vendors http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/software  You could want to add Xen.org contact information to the latter page.
