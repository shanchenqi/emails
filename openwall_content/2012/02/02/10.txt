I had this doubt when reporting them and i decide to consider them XSS for one main reason: even with a CSRF protection an operator is still able to inject javascript into visitor's browser (ie an operator sets chat title to XSS and it gets executed when new visitor opens a chat). But propably you are rignt, there is no gain for an admin to exploit this and, for sure you are right, a password reset has a bigger impact.

It's standard operating procedure - and has been for many years - to particularly pay attention to these "XSS hiding CSRF" cases. For that reason you'll often see discrepancies in the original report and the released Secunia advisories. >  > In the case of Mibew, the functionality is restricted to admins and from an administrator's perspective there is no gain. Therefore, we do not consider it a vulnerability in itself. However, via the CSRF vector it can be exploited by non-admins. This is why the Secunia advisory is rated as CSRF (like the OSVDB advisory) and just mentions XSS as a follow-up impact (along with alternatively just changing the administrator's password and gain full access that way). >  > I would definitely join Steve in encouraging researchers to keep this trend in mind by considering a) if a discovered issue actually provides a gain compared to legitimately accessible functionality and b) relies on another vulnerability in order to be an issue.
