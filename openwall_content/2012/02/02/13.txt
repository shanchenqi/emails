I suggest that we post this sort of things to oss-security not only because of CVE issues, but also to make this list a central place to keep people informed of security issues in at least popular Open Source software.  That is, I think this posting would be desirable even if the CVE number had already been communicated to those who might request one.  Not everyone who wants this sort of info also happens to read IT news sites, Twitter feeds, etc daily (which also include lots of other info that would be off-topic here).  Maybe your comment above was addressed to security@php and Stefan rather than to oss-security, though.  Then it sounds just right to me.
