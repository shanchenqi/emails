Upstream qemu has already released an advisory hence there is no embargo.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  The vulnerability impacts any host running HVM (Fully-Emulated) guests which are configured with an NIC (using in their VIF configuration. Note that the default emulated NIC is which is not vulnerable.  Hosts which run only PV guests or which use the default NIC are not effected.  MITIGATION ==========  Switching all HVM guests to a different emulated NIC (e.g. which is the default) or PV network drivers will remove this vulnerability.  Enabling device model stub domains for such guests will also mitigate any arbitrary code execution exploit by restricting it to the stub domain only.  RESOLUTION ==========  This issue is resolved in the following changesets:   qemu-xen-unstable.git        qemu-xen-4.1-testing.git     qemu-xen-4.0-testing.git    In each case the QEMU_TAG in the corresponding xen.hg repository has been updated so that a completely fresh build will pick up the fix:   xen-unstable.hg        xen-4.1-testing.hg     xen-4.0-testing.hg   (Currently in http://xenbits.xen.org/staging/xen-*.hg; will be  in http://xenbits.xen.org/staging/xen*.hg after automated tests.)   PATCH INFORMATION =================  The patch is in the upstream qemu.git tree.  A backported version, as has been applied to qemu-xen-*.git, is attached as  $    -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =sC0B -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----   View attachment of type "text/plain" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
