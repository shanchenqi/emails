Increasing the burden for security response on companies with employees is one thing, but on volunteers is probably going to lead to a serious set of problems and some long term consequences that are probably MUCH worse for users than a few potentially security issues that potentially leak early.   --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
