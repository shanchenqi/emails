Yes, this is one of the things I expect to be happening, too.  You asked me "why", but not "why not" - and this matches our roles for this discussion well. ;-)  > As a distro, I now have two choices: I sit on vulnerabilities until our > own QA and testing is done, at which point I send them to the list and  Why can't you send to the list when you are half-way done, if 2 weeks would have been enough for you normally?  > hope that 7 days is enough for everyone else, or I simply stop using the > list for anything that's more than trivial and contact other vendors > directly.  Another option: contact large vendors who need more time for QA first (2 weeks before CRD), post to the list later (1 week before CRD).  There are possibly just a few large vendors/distros who need this (I am thinking Ubuntu, Red Hat, SUSE - and that might be all).  Also, when you post to the list, you're able to share more info with other vendors (those on the list): not only info on the bug, but also your patches (perhaps already partially tested), advisory draft, etc. That way, it is easier for other vendors to be done in 1 more week.  Drawbacks: - Large vendors gain an advantage. - Fixes may be worse since no input is provided by other/smaller vendors early on (e.g., I would not have a chance to identify a shortcoming in a patch being tested by Ubuntu until the patch is already sent to QA, so is too late to revise unless it fails QA).
