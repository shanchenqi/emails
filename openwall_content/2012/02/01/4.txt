A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted Unicode string as a xchat channel or private message, which once processed would lead to denial of service (xchat client crash), or, potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running xchat client.  This issue has been successfully reproduced on Xchat-WDK versions prior to: *       add Non-BMP plugin to avoid client crashes  version. Also Joerg Reisenweber reports, this deficiency to have been exploited in the past on versions, as being used on Maemo architecture.  The following Linux based xchat versions have been investigated against presence of this issue: * * *  on various architectures ppc64) with various versions of gtk2 library: * * * *  and presence of this flaw has not been observed on those Linux versions, which makes us think it is some Microsoft Windows 7 / Maemo architecture specific feature, which makes this issue to be visible on those Xchat derivatives.  References: [1] [2] [3] [4]  Xchat-WDK upstream changelog: [5] http://www.xchat-wdk.org/home/changelog      part:      *       add Non-BMP plugin to avoid client crashes  Particular Xchat-WDK upstream patch: [6] http://lwsitu.com/xchat/replace_non-bmp.diff  Could you allocate two CVE ids for these flaws? (assuming two ids are necessary, because Xchat-WDK for MS Windows 7 case and for Maemo case can / should be considered as different source code bases).  Steve, please advise if one id is sufficient or two should be used?  Also, for the Xchat-WDK case it looks that corrected the issue for channel messages, but the issue is still present for 'private messages' case: [7] [8] [9]  Though this assumption needs to be verified / confirmed yet. Viktor, could you please confirm or disprove it?  If that assumption would have shown as valid, a third CVE identifier would need to be assigned yet for the incomplete Xchat-WDK fix yet (addressing the issue for 'channel messages' case, but not for 'private messages' case).
