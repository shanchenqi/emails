Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: Re: CVE Requests for FFmpeg  ================================================ HEAP buffer overflows (10): (write) lavfi: add missing check in avfilter_filter_samples()     Simple case of missing check, there wasnt much using the audio filters so     this probably is not practically exploitable  ws_snd1: Fix wrong samples count and crash.     Simple case of amount written and check mismatching  j2kdec: Fix integer overflow leading to a segfault      The check missed negative values, j2k is marked as experimental though so     depending on the user app this may require the user to enable it.  aacsbr: Fix memory corruption.      v_off becoming negative and writes based on this overwriting various fields     of the struct which valgrind didnt detect.  check chroma_format_idc range.   adpcm: Fix crash      Allocation for X channels, write for 2, this adds a X!=2 check  atrac3: Fix crash in tonal component decoding.      Simple case of index becoming bigger than array without checks  CODEC_ID_SOL_DPCM: Fix used write buffer.     Wrong pointer being used to write after recent audio API change.  j2kdec: Check curtileno for validity     Simple missing check for index and array size. j2k is marked as experimental though so     depending on the user app this may require the user to enable it.  Fix regression / crash with lowres.      memset of the full size in a reduced size buffer, this requires the user     to enable lowres  ================================================ 	 HEAP+possible STACK buffer overflow (1): (write) j2kdec: Fix crash in get_qcx     Simple missing check for index and array size. j2k is marked as experimental though so     depending on the user app this may require the user to enable it.  ================================================  Things that didnt fit in above (2): shorten: Fix invalid free()     Adding a offset after realloc() but not undoing that before a possible     2nd realloc()   vorbis: Fix last quarter of     This fixes a apparently forgoten case in the original patchset from google     Ive reproduced this by setting multiplier to the maximal value that it could     reach  ================================================ So for all the interesting vulns:  HEAP buffer overflows (10): (write) HEAP+possible STACK buffer overflow (1): (write) Things that didnt fit in above (4): (just the first two)  that's 15 CVE's, the rest like Steve said do not quality for CVEs. Steve, ok if I go ahead with these 13?   --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
