I am for this change (in both my list member for > Openwall and my list admin capacity).  What about others?  A week is a pretty short delay to prepare updates and perform the necessary QA to get an issue out on time.

Reducing the maximum will just result in having everyone miss the embargo date and putting users at risk.  Marc.
