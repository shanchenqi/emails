Agreed, one thing that would be helpful is to start all CVE requests with "CVE Request" in the subject line which will make it easy for me to spot them. Anything informational can be whatever title (like what Solar Designer sent).  On the other hand how much overlap do we want with full-disclosure/bugzilla?  --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
