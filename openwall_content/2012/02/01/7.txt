I've just revised the last sentence above to say "In fact, embargo periods shorter than 7 days are preferable."  Can we possibly afford to change the maximum to 7 to 11 days (depending on day of week)?  That is, 7 days is the standard maximum, up to 11 days is possible if the issue is reported on a Thursday or a Friday (only in these two cases).  I am for this change (in both my list member for Openwall and my list admin capacity).  What about others?  (In fact, I'd prefer an even shorter maximum, but I am proposing what I think has a chance to be approved by others without making the list a lot less useful to them.)  Also, I added the following to the wiki page:  "Please note that any/all list postings may be made public once the corresponding security issue is publicly disclosed, so please do not post information that you want to stay private forever."  with a footnote that says:  "There was/is intent to be making all list postings public with a delay, which is currently not yet implemented for technical reasons, but it may be implemented and applied retroactively - that is, including to past postings."  Those "technical reasons" are me not being aware of a program to mass-decrypt an mbox with PGP/MIME messages (producing an mbox with decrypted messages).  I'd appreciate it if someone finds or writes this program.
