You mean with full-disclosure/Bugtraq (not Bugzilla)?  I think there will be quite little overlap.  Neither of these lists has anything resembling the full set of security issues even in popular Open Source projects posted to it - they receive small and arbitrary subsets instead (plus lots of other stuff that would be offtopic here).  With mostly CVE requests in here, we also have an arbitrary subset (albeit I think a larger one).  If we expand that to have good coverage of at least popular projects that many of us use, that would actually make this list more unique.
