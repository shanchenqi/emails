In the Mibew case, the PoC code has POST forms that invoke scripts like  "/operator/ban.php"  and "/operator/settings.php".  These are almost  certainly administrative functions that probably shouldn't be reachable at  all.  Thus, these might be better identified as CSRF issues at their core,  instead of XSS.  It seems that some researchers report XSS in administrator modules, but  they omit when you need to use CSRF in order to get the administrator to  perform the XSS.  So, the primary issue is often CSRF, and XSS is only  resultant (since, in many cases, the admin already has privileges to edit  HTML).  The vuln DBs are starting to catch up with this "trend" in vuln  reporting, so there is a very slow shift towards identifying CSRF as the  core problem.  However, CSRF is in the eye of the beholder, in that you  often need to know the INTENDED functionality of the application before  you can interpret whether things are CSRF versus regular functionality,  versus good old XSS.  Note that this kind of XSS-hiding-CSRF issue is not necessarily tied to  admin functionality, but that's where it's a strong indicator that a  researcher might be ignoring CSRF.  Sometimes, though, it can be difficult to determine whether XSS or CSRF is  at the root, even if you're dealing with admin functionality.  For  example, maybe an admin program will check for CSRF and fail, but include  the original form in its error response, possibly enabling XSS.  Or, maybe  there are TWO issues at play - maybe a victim can be CSRF'ed to make posts  on their behalf, and also a secondary issue where the victim can become an  attacker and XSS other people (with or without CSRF).  Unfortunately, I strongly suspect that the number of XSS-hiding-CSRF  reports will grow :-(  For people who investigate vuln reports closely, please keep this trend in  mind.  If you are a researcher, consider whether XSS or other issues are  really legitimate functionality that is only reachable by targeting the  victim with CSRF; if that's the case, then the CSRF is "primary" and the  XSS is "resultant" and not a separate vulnerability - and if your targeted  application has CSRF, then maybe there's a more powerful impact than just  XSS.  (For example, depending on how settings / configuration is  implemented, you might be able to get code execution out of it.)  - Steve   On Wed, 1 Feb Kurt Seifried wrote:  > On AM, Henri Salo wrote: >> This seems to need CVE-identifier. >> >> Advisory: >> Codseq own advisory: http://www.codseq.it/advisories/mibew_messenger_multiple_xss >> OSVDB: >> Secunia: >> >> At the moment http://mibew.org/ does not work for me. >> >> - Henri Salo > > Please use for this issue. > > P.S. for some reason OSVDB lists this as a CSRF issue (?) which is > mentioned in the advisory but not really shown. > > --  > Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) >  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
