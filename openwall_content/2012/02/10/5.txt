However, GLPI provides default accounts that often aren't  changed or disabled:      glpi/glpi     tech/tech     normal/normal     post-only/postonly  Impact ======  Since there is a suffix, the vulnerability can be used as a RFI (requires allow_url_include = On).  For LFI, the target file has to end up with "parameter.php". GLPI automatically escapes all GET and POST parameters  with addslashes(), so the null byte technique is not usable. I have not tested exploitation using the path truncation  technique but it might be possible.   Mitigation ==========  Upgrade to GLPI   Exploit =======  http://<server>/front/popup.php?popup=add_ruleparameter&sub_type=<file>   Timeline ========  08 feb - Found the bug. 09 feb - Contacted the GLPI Team. 09 feb - Bug fixed & new version available.  Thanks to the GLPI team for being responsive!  References ==========   I think you can package the new version into security updates. Please let me know if you need any more details.
