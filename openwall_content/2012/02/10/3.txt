I am not sure what the CVE-identifier is as I told in my last email to this thread. New cases I have seen: latter link with a list of "a different vulnerability than". I do NOT have any facts about these vulnerabilities. I hope Oracle coordinates issues like these with MITRE/US-CERT and adds more information to advisory and CVE after these are public and distros are ready.  - Henri Salo  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
