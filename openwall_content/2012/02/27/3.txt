Mariusz, could you clarify, if this issue has got a CVE identifier    already or if we still need one? If aren't able to do so, whom    should we contact to be clear about "CVE request status" for this?     Or at least clarify which list that "Here is a part of massage sent    by developers to package maintainers:" has been sent to? (so    we could ask there)     And in the end either use that one, already allocated or allocate    a new one here via OSS.     Below being issue description as I got it based on / from [2]:     A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way Kadu, the instant messenger compatible with the Gadu-Gadu protocol, performed sanitization of status and sms messages for particular contact in user's history. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted status or sms message, which would be stored in victim's Kadu history file, if the attacker was present on the contact list of the victim and the victim has had storage of statuses enabled for their history file. When the victim later examined the content of the status history, this flaw could lead to arbitrary HTML or webscript execution.
