For example one can have lots of fun with this. Copy from installation.php:  """     case(isset($_POST['db_name'])):          $host = $_POST['host'];         $db_name = $_POST['db_name'];         $db_user_name = $_POST['db_user_name'];         $db_password = $_POST['db_password'];          $admin_name = $_POST['admin_name'];         $admin_password = $_POST['admin_password'];          $o_host = $_POST['o_host'];         $o_db_name = $_POST['o_db_name'];         $o_db_user_name = $_POST['o_db_user_name'];         $o_db_password = $_POST['o_db_password'];          //read in the file         $file = "../functions/db_connect.php";         $fh = fopen($file, 'r+');         $contents = fread($fh, filesize($file));          //set up the text to change         $text_to_change = array();         $new_text = array();          $text_to_change[] = '$dbhost="'.$o_host.'"';         $text_to_change[] = '$dbuser="'.$o_db_user_name.'"';         $text_to_change[] = '$dbpass="'.$o_db_password.'"';         $text_to_change[] = '$dbname="'.$o_db_name.'"';          $new_text[] = '$dbhost="'.$host.'"';         $new_text[] = '$dbuser="'.$db_user_name.'"';         $new_text[] = '$dbpass="'.$db_password.'"';         $new_text[] = '$dbname="'.$db_name.'"';          $new_contents = str_replace($text_to_change, $new_text, $contents);         fclose($fh);          // Open file to write         $fh = fopen($file, 'r+');         fwrite($fh, $new_contents);         fclose($fh);          //set up new admin user          include '../functions/db_connect.php';          db_connect(); """  I'll bet this software is not used much, but I can list all problems I can find if we want to assign CVE-identifiers to cases like these. No contact information of developer found. Any ideas how to get these fixed or get the code out of internet.
