Most of them were secure for IPv4 but the IPv6 case was more complicated. But given the fact there is a gazillon of them this was difficult to check them all. On Netfilter side, we've decided  to publish the document explaining how to secure helpers to explain how to fix this. It was some months ago and I hope it has been read.  I've contacted the frontend developers and Netfilter/Linux firewalls vendors I knew to have them test their software/equipment. I've started this some months ago. I've also tried to contact the various CERT but they refused to handle the case or did not reply to my requests.
