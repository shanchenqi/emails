It certainly makes sense for cautios applications to make sure sensitive settings have restricted access permissions. Question is whether it is actually a vulnerability if they don't. Quoting the XDG spec¹  | If, when attempting to write a file, the destination directory is | non-existant an attempt should be made to create it with permission | If the destination directory exists already the permissions should | not be changed.  So it could be argued that mumble just relied on the specification that already mandates restrictive permissions on ~/.config.  The program that is supposed to create ~/.config on login had a bug that made the dir in violation of the spec². Fixing the permissions is not allowed according to the spec though ...  cu Ludwig  [1] http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html [2]  --   (o_   Ludwig Nussel  //\  V_/_  http://www.suse.de/ SUSE LINUX Products GmbH, GF: Jeff Hawn, Jennifer Guild, Felix Imendörffer, HRB (AG Nürnberg)   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
