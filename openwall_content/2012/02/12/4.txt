OVERVIEW  The CubeCart and lower versions are vulnerable to Open URL Redirection.   2. BACKGROUND  CubeCart is an "out of the box" ecommerce shopping cart software solution which has been written to run on servers that have PHP & MySQL support. With CubeCart you can quickly setup a powerful online store which can be used to sell digital or tangible products to new and existing customers all over the world.   3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION  The CubeCart and lower versions contain a flaw that allows a remote cross site redirection attack. This flaw exists because the application does not properly sanitise the parameters,"goto" and "r". This allows an attacker to create a specially crafted URL, that if clicked, would redirect a victim from the intended legitimate web site (domain.com) to an arbitrary web site (localhost) of the attacker's choice.   4.
