Impact: An attacker on a local network can open some pinholes in a firewall which is not correctly protected. Fix: None, the issue has to be fixed in the firewall configuration. Workaround: Apply a strict anti-spoofing policy for IPv4 and IPv6 as described in the document "Secure use of iptables and connection tracking helpers"  This document was written after private disclosure of the attack to the Netfilter's team.  This attack will be presented at Cansecwest, March 9th  Secure use of iptables and connection tracking helpers: http://home.regit.org/netfilter-en/secure-use-of-helpers/  Best regards, --  Eric Leblond  Blog: http://home.regit.org/  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
