OVERVIEW  OxWall and lower versions are vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting.   2. BACKGROUND  Oxwall is a free open source software package for building social networks, family sites and collaboration systems. It is a flexible community website engine developed with the aim to provide people with a well-coded, user-friendly software platform for social needs. It is easy to set up, configure and manage Oxwall while you focus on your site idea. We are testing the concept of free open source community software for complete (site,sub-site setups) and partial (widgets,features) community and collaboration solutions for companies and individuals.   3.
