While we've not proven the bugs to be exploitable, we've also not ruled out the possibility that they could be.  Fixes were committed on Feb 16, https://github.com/glensc/file/commits/master   Thank you,    Will Dormann  ============================= Vulnerability Analyst CERT Coordination Center Fifth Ave. Pittsburgh, PA =============================  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =zqku -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
