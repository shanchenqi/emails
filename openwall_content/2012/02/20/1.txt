I am writing you because I have discovered some vulnerabilities in Debian F*EX <= (stable) and F*EX (testing and unstable) I have already contacted the Author who confirmed the vulnerabilities and applied the suggested fixes. A major update of F*EX  has been released on the 15th of February The Debian Mantainer of the package is working on it. Together with the Author we decided not to release any public advisory before the release of the new Debian package.  I would be grateful if you could assign CVE ids to the discovered issues.  You will find the two advisories as an attachment.
