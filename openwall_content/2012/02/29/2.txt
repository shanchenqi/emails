That means NM (or rather wpa_supplicant which gets configured by NM) accesses the user's files as root. A user who is allowed to add connections (default for locally logged in users) may specify arbitrary file names. NM happily accepts files of any other user, including root and even device files. Fortunately it's read access only.  The safe approach would be to stream the actual content of the certificate and key files to NM and have NM store that directly. In fact NM 0.7 does just that for system connections (but forgets to store the key so those connections won't actually work).  NM 0.6 is also affected.  Reproducer for NM 0.9 attached, you need to edit the file names and then run e.g. $ nmw.py new wlan0 yourssid  cu Ludwig  --   (o_   Ludwig Nussel  //\  V_/_  http://www.suse.de/ SUSE LINUX Products GmbH, GF: Jeff Hawn, Jennifer Guild, Felix ImendĂśrffer, HRB (AG NĂźrnberg)   View attachment "nmw.py" of type "text/x-python" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
