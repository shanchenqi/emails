Here's a more direct link:   (e.g. for referring to in distro advisories).  News story summarizing the problem (in Russian, sorry):   It also mentions that Oracle Linux merely reuses RHEL's updates to MySQL without any reference to Oracle's own MySQL vulnerability/fix info.  So it is not even clear whether Oracle Linux has these 27 bugs in MySQL fixed or not, despite of MySQL being an Oracle product.
