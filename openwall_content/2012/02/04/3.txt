That's why I think its more appropriate to defer such decisions to the researcher who understands the complexity of the problem at hand (of course hopefully allowing negotiation with those affected to choose a disclosure date that can be met).  >> That can be set by the researcher (with some reasonable >> maximum, like a month). >> >> We all should be able to see what is going on over in the closed list. >>  Although it is unlikely being used for nefarious purposes (hiding >> issues permanently, etc.), transparency (after a delay) is the only >> way to show that it is not.  Anyway, 30 days seems appropriate. > > I don't mind.  Like I said, I need a tool - a program to mass-decrypt a > PGP/MIME mbox, producing another mbox.  I think such a program might be > generally useful.  Well, or alternatively I need to introduce a > different mechanism for the archive - not treat it as a regular > subscriber like I intended to.  Completely unfleshed out, but a pseudo-bash script along the lines of the following should do it:    echo "" > newmbox   gpg-agent --allow-preset-passphrase   /usr/lib/gnupg2/gpg-preset-passphrase --preset <cache id>   cat mbox | while read line; do       test <header> && echo $line >> /tmp/header       test <body> && echo $line >> /tmp/body       if [ <end off body> ]; then           cat /tmp/header >> newmbox           cat /tmp/body | gpg --decrypt >> newmbox       fi   done   /usr/lib/gnupg2/gpg-preset-passphrase --forget  Obviously a bit more work there to figure out appropriate conditionals to put in the angle brackets.
