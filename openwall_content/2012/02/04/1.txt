I think the important aspect here is the transparency of the private discussion (after an appropriate delay), rather than the length of the delay itself.  That can be set by the researcher (with some reasonable maximum, like a month).  We all should be able to see what is going on over in the closed list.  Although it is unlikely being used for nefarious purposes (hiding issues permanently, etc.), transparency (after a delay) is the only way to show that it is not.  Anyway, 30 days seems appropriate.
