However exit_io_context() only decrements ioc->refcount if ioc->nr_tasks reaches 0.  With CLONE_IO, parent's io_context->nr_tasks is incremented, but never decremented whenever copy_process() fails afterwards, which prevents exit_io_context() from calling IO schedulers exit functions.  An unprivileged local user could use these flaws cause denial of service.
