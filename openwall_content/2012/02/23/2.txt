Which components the vulnerabilities are in, is rarely relevant for  deciding how many CVEs to assign.  Much more critical is which versions  are affected.  The original researcher provided two advisories for 2  different versions.  So even though "fup" is affected, we mould need to  SPLIT if there are some items/vectors/issues that affect different  versions than others (hint: we will SPLIT.)

Here are the breakdowns for the two advisories/versions:  F*EX <=    fup / from parameter    fup / to parameter    fup / id parameter  F*EX    fup / id parameter   So, based on the original report, we have:     only:      fup / from      fup / to     *and*      fup / id  So, we MERGE the "fup" and "from" vectors since they affect the same  version, and we SPLIT these from the "id" vector. (For the incredibly  detail-oriented: whether the parameters come via GET or POST methods is  irrelevant for CVE.)  Now, the question is which issue we link with  Since Debian  bug focuses on the id parameter, and that paremeter affects both  listed versions, I guess it makes sense to focus on the id  parameter.
