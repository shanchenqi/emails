I tried a year ago with openssl and AFAIK its still suffering (at least I never heared back).  If you compile your openssh '--with-ssl-engine' you have an easy root exploit (given that ssh-keysign is mode such as on Debian) via OPENSSL_config().  If you ask me, thats quite poor for a framework that wants to add security to the system. So, I do not have any problems adding our own patch sets rather than waiting for another year.  Another lib that should receive a patch is libudev.
