Any thoughts on > this one?  We use "multiple vulnerabilities" in the title when the listing all fixed vulnerabilities becomes cumbersome. I agree it's not ideal. I believe that the lack of validation in the login theft is separate from the CSRF. Ben Adida is familiar with it and could potentially give advice.  > >> - Janrain Capture - Open Redirect > > > mentioned a second separate issue for "An > additional security weakness occurs when the module creates a new > local user account." > > - open redirect > > (new) - disclosure of portions of passwords  True disclosure in only happens if an attacker gains access to the user's session object (e.g. due to loss of a database backup or an insecure memcache configuration). We mention that as a poor security practice that was improved, but aren't sure what class of vulnerability that should be and whether it really deserves to be called out separately. There have been several other instances where credentials or credential-like information is stored unencrypted in a location that seems like a bad idea because it's more likely to be leaked (e.g. the sessions database table) but where it's not a direct immediate threat. Any advice on whether you feel those truly deserve a CVE assignment?  I have not updated the advisory to include  >> > > > A close reading of suggests that there should be > two CVEs.
