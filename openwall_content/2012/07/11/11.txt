Reproducer: 	test -e  Problem is caught by -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 if enabled, and likely also by -fstack-protector (not tested)  Goes all the way back to old bashes.  The likeliness of people able to inject those filenames into shell scripts and not being able to execute shellcode themselves is however slim. (setuid root shell scripts are not possible.)  Security (CVE) relevant scenario we thought of is breaking out of a restricted shell mode.
