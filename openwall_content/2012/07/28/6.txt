OVERVIEW  ocPoral CMS and lower versions are vulnerable to Open URL Redirection.   2. BACKGROUND  ocPortal is the website Content Management System (a CMS) for building and maintaining a dynamic website. ocPortal's powerful feature-set means there's always a way to accomplish your vision. Not only does ocPortal's CMS have all the features you'd expect: for instance photo galleries, news, file downloads and community forums/chats, but it does so whilst meeting the highest accessibility and professional standards. It is also smart enough to go beyond page management, to automatically handle search engine optimisation, and provide aggressive hack attack prevention.   3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION  ocPoral CMS and lower versions contain a flaw that allows a remote cross site redirection attack. This flaw exists because the application does not properly sanitise the "redirect" parameter.  This allows an attacker to create a specially crafted URL, that if clicked, would redirect a victim from the intended legitimate web site to an arbitrary web site of the attacker's choice.   4.
