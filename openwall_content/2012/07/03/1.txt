Jan Kara did some fixes in the UDF fs and they were committed to mainline already, both actual bugfixes and some more sanity checking for hardening.  Buffer overreads or overwrites would have been possible.   I think a single CVE is sufficient.   The two mainline commits:   commit Author: Jan Kara <jack@...e.cz> Date:   Wed Jun 27      udf: Fortify loading of sparing table      Add sanity checks when loading sparing table from disk to avoid accessing     unallocated memory or writing to it.      Signed-off-by: Jan Kara <jack@...e.cz>  commit Author: Jan Kara <jack@...e.cz> Date:   Wed Jun 27      udf: Avoid run away loop when partition table length is corrupted          Check provided length of partition table so that (possibly maliciously)     corrupted partition table cannot cause accessing data beyond current buffer.
