By requesting files to be injected in malicious paths, a remote authenticated user could inject files in arbitrary locations on the host file system, potentially resulting in full compromise of the compute node. Only Essex and later setups running the OpenStack API over libvirt-based hypervisors are affected.  Upon further inspection of the code, Pรกdraig Brady from Red Hat found an additional vulnerability. By crafting a malicious image and requesting an instance based on it, a remote authenticated user may corrupt arbitrary files on the host filesystem, potentially resulting in a denial of service. This affects all setups.  Fixes: Folsom: Essex: Diablo: see patch at  References:  Notes: This fix will be included in the folsom-2 development milestone (published this week) and in future Essex and Diablo releases.  - --  Thierry Carrez (ttx) OpenStack Vulnerability Management Team -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org/  JJcGXBOJw/J7rCmBIDuQ =/7QJ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
