Following this apparently RFE on JBOSS i have found a nice description, and an  proposed patch, about it here  But the last link describe - apparently - a serious bug in the JBoss JMX Invoker Layer, a missing authentication that can produce a serious problem. Reading the other response i don't think there is today the possibility to enforce a true mitigation in JBOSS, apart putting in place some form a network control (aka a firewall). This is for JBOSS 5.0, i know that twiddle is no longer in JBoss EAP 6.0 which provides a totally new, much improved, secure and scriptable management interface.  Do you think this can require a CVE for JBOSS EAP 5?
