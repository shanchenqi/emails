Details as follows:  A Heap-based buffer overflow was found in the way libjpeg-turbo decompressed certain corrupt JPEG images in which the component count was erroneously set to a large value. An attacker could create a specially-crafted JPEG image that, when opened, could cause an application using libpng to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.
