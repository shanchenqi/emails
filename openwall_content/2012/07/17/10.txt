Thanks for the info, Laurent (and thanks for the testcase, David).  I'm still unsure whether or not a CVE is required, as per Kurt's comments about whether or not kmail was ever advertised as not executing javascript.  I think because, at one time, it did not execute javascript, and now it does (which is clearly bad for a mail client to do), it probably does require a CVE name but before assigning one and getting negative feedback, I'd like to make sure that assigning one is indeed appropriate.  --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
