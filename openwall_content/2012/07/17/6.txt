I'm not aware of other Linux libc's having this, but I proposed __secure_getenv() (as well as OpenBSD'ish issetugid() or/and __libc_enable_secure) for addition to musl.  (No, I did not write any code for this.  I merely told Rich and heard back.)  I may be biased, but I think that musl is the main alternative to glibc on Linux now.
