Xen versions 3.2 and earlier are not, in fact, vulnerable; they have an entirely different emulation mechanism.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Internal data of the emulator for MMIO operations may, under certain rare conditions, at the end of one emulation cycle be left in a state affecting a subsequent emulation such that this second emulation would fail, causing an exception to be reported to the guest kernel where none is expected.  IMPACT ======  Guest mode unprivileged (user) code, which has been granted the privilege to access MMIO regions, may leverage that access to crash the whole guest.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All HVM guests exposing MMIO ranges to unprivileged (user) mode.  Xen versions 3.3 and later are vulnerable to this issue.  MITIGATION ==========  This issue can be mitigated by running PV (para-virtualised) guests only, or by ensuring (inside the guest) that MMIO regions can be accessed only by trustworthy processes.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch will resolve the issue.  PATCH INFORMATION =================  The attached patches resolve this issue  $ xsa10-*.patch   xsa10-unstable.patch -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =sOWo -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  View attachment of type "text/plain" bytes)  View attachment "xsa10-unstable.patch" of type "text/plain" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
