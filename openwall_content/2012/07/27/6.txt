An SQL injection flaw was found in Zabbix, where input passed via the "itemid" parameter to popup_bitem.php is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.  The report was against version but the upstream bug report [1] indicates this also affects 1.8.x.  Upstream has patched [2] this, and there is a potential patch for 1.8.x [3].  [1] [2] [3]  Other references:   Thanks.  --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
