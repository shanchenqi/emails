A token expiration date can be circumvented by continuously creating new tokens before the old one has expired. Existing tokens also remain valid after a user account is disabled or after an account password changed. An authenticated and authorized user could potentially leverage those vulnerabilities to extend his access beyond the account owner expectations.  Folsom fixes:  Essex fixes:  References:  Notes: Those fixes were already included in Keystone stable update and the Folsom-1 development milestone.  - --  Thierry Carrez (ttx) OpenStack Vulnerability Management Team -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org/  iQIcBAEBCAAGBQJQErMZAAoJEFB6+JAlsQQjMrkP/juA+StMaNQNNqfPyV4gFJHG =fX6q -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
