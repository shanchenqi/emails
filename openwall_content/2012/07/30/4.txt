Do you know if the APIs would allow confining plug-ins to  subprocesses?  Then we only have to solve the transparent child process  problem.  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
