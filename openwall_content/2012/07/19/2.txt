The way good_client called tcp_wrappers via hosts_ctl was not correct, possibly causing hosts access rules defined in hosts.{allow,deny} not to be honored.  Reference:  Can a CVE id be please allocated to this issue? (Possibly i think)  Thanks!.  --  Huzaifa Sidhpurwala / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
