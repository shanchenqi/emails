Correct:  Please use  for the plupload CSRF issue  Vulnerability #2: CSRF in Plupload  The Plupload applet called Security.allowDomain('*') to allow the applet to be used from any domain (so it could be served from S3, for instance). That meant people could interact with the Plupload applet from any other site on the Internet by embedding it on a page and using JavaScript. But due to the way the same-origin policy works in Flash, the applet could still make requests back to the domain on which it was hosted. In addition, people can specify the full URL for an upload request via JavaScript and the result of that request (ie: the HTML of the resulting page) is passed back via JavaScript to the embedding page.   - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF    -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org/  iQIcBAEBAgAGBQJQBiqCAAoJEBYNRVNeJnmTBu8P/RHCEtYcd7QsWGuaiRUrpRCy =ePvM -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
