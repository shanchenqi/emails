When libvirt was configured to provide a range of public IP addresses to its guest domains and dnsmasq was instructed to discard packets originating from other interfaces, than specified on the command line via the --bind-interface option, those packets (coming from 'prohibited' interfaces) were not dropped properly and subsequently processed.     A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a distributed denial of service, as demonstrated in the report [1] via "stream of spoofed DNS queries producing large results".
