From my understanding it's a combination of both of them, which is making it a security flaw (libvirt has announced to provide DNS masquerade and due to a bug in one component, actually providing that functionality, this allowed a DDoS attacks).     Once libvirt announced the separation, is it it's responsibility to handle it? And as such security flaw in libvirt?     For the dnsmasq package, it doesn't look like a security flaw (rather as bug, when handling certain CLI option -- it would not ignore packets as instructed).     I am not completely sure, there has been similar enough example in the past, which could help us to decide which component the particular CVE identifier should be assigned to.     Could you clarify / help us to understand Mitre's opinion here?
