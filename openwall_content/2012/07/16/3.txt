Doing some digging, it looks like this was introduced in kdepim 4.4, and would not affect earlier versions.  Can anyone confirm this?  I'm cc'ing Laurent Montel who made the commit, and who should be able to shed some light as to when the vulnerability was introduced, and also answer Kurt's question above.  Laurent, any information you can provide would be appreciated.  --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
