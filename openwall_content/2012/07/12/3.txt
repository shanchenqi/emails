Are we simply talking about violating those restrictions?  Yes. Breaking out of the restricted shell using this issue.  $ bash -r bash: /dev/pts/9: Gesperrt: Die Ausgabe darf nicht umgeleitet werden. $ test -f *** buffer overflow detected ***: bash terminated ...  So basically without fortification measures you can inject a ASCII based shell-code to execute code you shouldn't.  (One can argue that of how secure you evaluate restricted shells ...)
