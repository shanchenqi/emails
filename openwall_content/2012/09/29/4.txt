It just required a mini fire-drill to verify that, and ensure the packages we are using in our deployments indeed had the fixes in. As you point out, the original problem report didn't have a CVE designation assigned, so the relevant commit messages and standard security tracking mechanisms didn't indicate the fixes are included. A fun way to spend a friday afternoon.  IIRC,  per security process packages/distributors are notified before the CVE's are made public.  It would be a great fire-drill extinguisher if the CVE announcement provided a link to a centralized location (for the CVE) where packages maintainers could update the distribution information.  > Thanks, > > - -- > Russell Bryant > -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- > Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux) > Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://www.enigmail.net/ > > > > =RMEV > -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
