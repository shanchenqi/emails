The task T uses "almost all" memory, then it does something which triggers request_module().  Say, it can simply call sys_socket().  This in turn needs more memory and leads to OOM.  oom-killer correctly chooses T and kills it, but this can't help because it sleeps in TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE and after that oom-killer becomes "disabled" by the TIF_MEMDIE task T.  A local unprivileged user can make the system unusable.  Upstream fixes: (1) "usermodehelper: use UMH_WAIT_PROC consistently" (2) "usermodehelper: introduce umh_complete(sub_info)" (3) "usermodehelper: implement UMH_KILLABLE" (4) "usermodehelper: kill umh_wait, renumber UMH_* constants" (5) "usermodehelper: ____call_usermodehelper() doesn't need do_exit()" (6) "kmod: introduce call_modprobe() helper" (7) "kmod: make __request_module() killable"  According to the reporter, (1) and (4) are optional and safer to exclude.
