Please use for the incomplete >fix for  There may be a difference in terminology here. Some CVE entries have a "NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-####-####." sentence. This means that a product originally had a vulnerability (for example, CVE-AAAA-BBBB) that had vectors V1 and V2 in version X.Y. Then, a new version X.Z was released in which a code change prevented exploitation through vector V1, but still allowed exploitation through vector V2. Here, a new CVE (for example, CVE-CCCC-DDDD) is needed because vector V2 is now known to have different affected versions than vector V1. The CVE-CCCC-DDDD description would mention "vulnerability in X.Z ... via V2 ... NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-AAAA-BBBB."  In the current situation, will probably be modified soon to have a "NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-####-####." sentence. However, unless another related vulnerability is discovered in the future, there won't be any CVE entry with a "NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for sentence. Because of this, "Please use for the incomplete fix for is potentially confusing to some people.  Although a vulnerability statement such as "First one still has the possibility of injecting '\r' before the first '\n'" can be associated with the concept of an incomplete fix, MITRE does not consider the fix to be an "incomplete fix for" a different CVE (that references a better patch). In our terminology, the "incomplete fix for" phrase is only used for pointers in the opposite direction. And, of course, CVEs are assigned to vulnerabilities, not to fixes.  >The second one kills the protection for the NUL byte check, so it won't >allow header splitting for Apache SAPI, but FastCGI stuff will be affected,  A mostly unrelated comment is that MITRE doesn't associate the "incomplete fix" concept with this "kills the protection for the NUL byte check" issue. A code change occurred during the process of trying to fix a vulnerability, but the effect of the code change was to introduce a different vulnerability.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =9KKK -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
