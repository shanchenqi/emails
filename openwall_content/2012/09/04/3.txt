As far as I'm aware, there was no CVE assigned when the original header  injection/response splitting protection was added. I presume there wasn't  one because it was a security feature to protect applications that didn't  validate what was being passed to header()[1], not a fix for a vulnerability.

Perhaps I'm misunderstanding something, but the above is confusing me.  To me, this is what each of the ids represent: describes the protection bypass describes the failure to fully fix the protection bypass  (hence the "incomplete fix for   P.S.
