Ok, so I think we need 1 CVE for the two insecure temporary file uses, unless we want to split each temporary file issue under a separate CVE.  I don't believe there's a real need to assign CVE for (which did not improve things on systems with world writable /var/lock) or (which re-opens the attack for pkcs11 group members on systems with restricted /var/lock, but improves things on systems with world writable /var/lock).  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
