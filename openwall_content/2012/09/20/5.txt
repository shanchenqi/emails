Out of curiosity, what is the definition of "reported codebase" here? I'm asking as 2 CVEs were assigned, one for Oracle JVM and one for OpenJDK JVM.  Those codebases are not unrelated though, both problems are quite likely to exist because of a bug in a shared code, which usually implies single CVE.  The current practice is that Java CVEs assigned by Oracle and used for Oracle Java SE are also used to refer to fixes applied to the open-sourced (OpenJDK) or licensed (IBM Java) JDK versions that share the vulnerable code.  For example, a single was used for the recent 0day flaw in Oracle Java SE 7, IBM Java SE 7 and OpenJDK 7. Is the use of for all 3 considered wrong?  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
