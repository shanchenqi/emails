When do pkcsslotd does that, and which version?

If pkcs11 group member can make pkcsslotd chmod lock file, pkcs11 group membership need to be assumed root equivalent without any additional condition.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
