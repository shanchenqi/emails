It is  possible for an attacker to replace the lock files with symlinks and have  pkcsslotd (or others) fchmod the target of the symlink to make it world- writable, create arbitrary files, etc. In response, upstream released which fixed the fchmod issue (commits  [3] and [4]). Niels discovered that still allowed arbitrary files creation by  following symlinks. Upstream then released fixing this last issue  (commits [5] and [6]).  Even with the fixes in members of the pkcs11 group could still use  symlink attacks. However, as per upstream's documentation, members of such  group are expected to be trusted[7].  Could CVE ids be assigned?
