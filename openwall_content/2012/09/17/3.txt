I've been doing a lot of work for the past year on various proactive security efforts. I keep coming back to two basic things.  1) Most people don't understand security (if they can learn is another topic). 2) We suck at explaining security concepts.  Item 1 is solvable to a certain degree with training, but this particular issue I bet is #2.  WE see why this is a problem and have trouble understanding why the PHP guys don't. Has anyone tried to talk to them about this further to see if the issue is they don't understand, or are they being stubborn?  I'm quite interested in this problem (the general communication issue, not specially this PHP problem).  Thanks.  --      JB  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
