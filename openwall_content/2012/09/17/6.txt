Just a note regarding the sessionid case: IIRC since 5.4  session.entropy_length is set to, erm, 32 (bytes.) Basically it appends N bytes from /dev/urandom to the other input for the  digest and then it is computed. (why 32 bytes, and why still use md5 by default, well...)  > I'm skeptical they will.

For instance, there is no word about  mt_rand not being suitable for criptographic pourposes (much less what that  means.) Sure, searching for "crypt" in the page shows a few comments saying that it  isn't suitable, but: a) there are far more "encryption functions", "random password generators",  and similar stuff in the comments than those that do mention its weaknesses.  b) the official documentation itself doesn't say a word. It should say it loud  and clear.  Comments should also be moderated. Many examples available as comments in  the documentation are incorrect.  Now, pointing it out is easy, but somebody has to actually do the work.  *That* is another issue.
