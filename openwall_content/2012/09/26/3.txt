When a user has been granted access to set of DN entries, but denied access to a specific subset of those entries, it was possible the user to obtain temporary (till next Directory Server restart) access to that subset of entries (they should not have had otherwise ability to access) when the DN entry was moved via database modify RDN function.  Upstream ticket: [1]  Relevant upstream patch: [2]  Could you allocate a CVE id for this?
