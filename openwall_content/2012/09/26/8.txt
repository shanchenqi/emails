Yeah, I was wondering about the possibility of an overflow there too. The amount being added is very small but in principle tbuf_size could be just below the overflow threshold.  And I agree that it would be saner to increase tbuf_size itself.  Having said all that, I still don't understand why this buffer needs padding at all.  			regards, tom lane  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
