I think it might make sense to look at this issue along the lines of RFC and sort the problems out a bit.  Classification of program output sensitivity, on a sliding scale:  MUST - GPG private key, OpenSSH private key, OpenSSL private keys, some log files for server apps, etc. [MUST - where having the file revealed would grossly impact security/negate the whole point of the operation/program or where there is a significant chance of sensitive data being output in the normal course of operations, for examples servers running in debug mode that log credentials in the log file]  SHOULD - Generic output from crypto programs/etc. health/finance apps [SHOULD - potentially sensitive data such as encrypted content, health and finance data, other regulated output, chat logs, etc. Things that would typically contain potentially sensitive data in output]  MAY - Generic output from things like tar/archivers, editors, etc. [MAY - none or extremely minimal negative impact, performance wise/etc, for example a file down loader]  SHOULD NOT - nothing comes to mind [SHOULD NOT - where securing the output has a negative impact]  MUST NOT - nothing comes to mind [MUST NOT - where securing the output would have a significant negative impact]  OPTIONAL - catch all for weirdness RECOMMENDED - anything can have one more more recommended  Basically stick programs into this framework with evidence/reasoning as to why they fit there, please note that a program may fit into one or more categories, e.g. some output (like key creation) falls under MUST and some (like encrypted messages) fall under SHOULD (this is an example, I'm not saying encrypted messages are a "SHOULD" and not a "MUST", I just needed an example).  So at least this way we bring some sanity/order to the problem rather than this general mishmash of "well it should" and so on.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://www.enigmail.net/  =QJk5 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
