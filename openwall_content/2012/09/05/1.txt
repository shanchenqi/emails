For all new members, their subscription was requested by the vendor's security team.  Here's how many people are currently subscribed for each distro, on linux-distros:  ALT Linux: 1 Android: 1 CentOS: 1 Chrome OS: 1 Debian: 4 Frugalware: 1 Gentoo: 2 Mandriva: 1 MontaVista Software: 1 Openwall: 1 Oracle: 2 Pardus: 2 Red Hat: 7 rPath: 1 Slackware: 1 SUSE: 4 Ubuntu: 6 Wind River: 1  On distros (in addition to all of the above):  FreeBSD: 2 NetBSD/pkgsrc: 3  Initially, we had a policy to announce each person's (un)subscription in here, but this was noisy and it was maybe-reasonably criticized for potentially being too transparent - making some people and their specific e-mail addresses more of a target, although those joining early on were obvious targets as their distros' security contact persons anyway. (Of course, all mail from the list to its members is PGP-encrypted, which partially mitigates the problem in some cases.)  Please let me know if we - the oss-security community - feel that we should return to that more/too transparent practice.  For now, I feel that only new vendors joining need to be announced/discussed in here, whereas routine changes of who from a distro's security team is subscribed may be handled off-list, and summaries like the above posted in here once in a while.
