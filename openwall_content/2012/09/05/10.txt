ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The device model used by fully virtualised (HVM) domains, qemu, does not properly handle escape sequences when emulating certain devices with a virtual console backend.  IMPACT ======  An attacker who has sufficient privilege to access a vulnerable device within a guest can overwrite portions of the device model's address space. This can allow them to escalate their privileges to that of the device model process.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen systems running HVM guests are potentially vulnerable to this depending on the specific guest configuration. The default configuration is vulnerable.  Guests using either the traditional "qemu-xen" or upstream qemu device models are vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  This issue can be avoided by only running PV guests or by configuring HVM guests to not use the virtual console('vc') backend for any device.  For serial devices specify in your guest configuration:      serial = 'none' in your guest configuration.  For parallel port devices the syntax is toolstack specific. For xend specify in your guest configuration:      parallel = 'none' For xl specify in your guest configuration:      xl: device_model_args = ['-parallel', 'none']  In both cases the default is to use the vulnerable 'vc' mode.  You can confirm whether or not you are vulnerable by pressing Ctrl-Alt-<N> (for digit N) while connected to either the VNC or SDL console. If you are able to switch to a window displaying "serial" or "parallel" then you are vulnerable.  The issue can also be mitigated by enabling the stub domain device model. In this case the attacked can only potentially gain control of the stub domain and not of the entire system.  To enable stub domains specify in your guest configuration:     device_model = "stubdom-dm"  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch(es) will resolve the issue.
