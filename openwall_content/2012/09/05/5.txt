VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All systems running 64-bit paravirtualised guests.  The vulnerability dates back to at least Xen 4.0.  4.0, 4.1, the 4.2 RCs, and xen-unstable.hg are all vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  This issue can be mitigated by ensuring (inside the guest) that the kernel is trustworthy, or by running only 32-bit or HVM guests.
