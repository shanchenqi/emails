Credit Matthew Daley.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  PHYSDEVOP_get_free_pirq does not check that its call to get_free_pirq succeeded, and if it fails will use the error code as an array index.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest might be able to cause the host to crash, leading to a DoS, depending on the exact memory layout.  Privilege escalation is a theoretical possibility which cannot be ruled out, but is considered unlikely.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen systems.  Xen 4.1 is vulnerable.  Other versions of Xen are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  This issue can be mitigated by ensuring (inside the guest) that the kernel is trustworthy and avoiding situations where something might repeatedly cause the attempted allocation of a physical irq.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch will resolve the issue.  CREDIT ======  Thanks to Matthew Daley for finding this vulnerability (and that in XSA-12) and notifying the Xen.org security team.  PATCH INFORMATION =================  The attached patches resolve this issue    Xen 4.1, 4.1.x                            $ xsa13-*.patch  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =s7wG -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
