Credit Matthew Daley.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  XENMEM_populate_physmap can be called with invalid flags.  By calling it with MEMF_populate_on_demand flag set, a BUG can be triggered if a translating paging mode is not being used.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest kernel can crash the host.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen systems running PV guests.  Systems running only HVM guests are not vulnerable.  The vulnerability dates back to at least Xen 4.0.  4.0, 4.1, the 4.2 RCs, and xen-unstable.hg are all vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  This issue can be mitigated by ensuring that the guest kernel is trustworthy or by running only HVM guests.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch will resolve the issue.  CREDIT ======  Thanks to Matthew Daley for finding this vulnerability (and that in XSA-12) and notifying the Xen.org security team.
