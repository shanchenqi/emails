ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The grant table hypercall's GNTTABOP_swap_grant_ref sub-operation does not perform adequate checks on the input grant references.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest kernel or administrator can crash the host.  It may be possible for an attacker to swap a valid grant reference, which they control, with an invalid one allowing them to write abitrary values to hypervisor memory. This could potentially lead to a privilege escalation.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen-unstable, including Xen 4.2 release candidates are vulnerable to this issue.  Xen 4.1 and earlier do not include this hypercall and are therefore not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  The only mitigation is not to run guests which have untrusted administrators.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached patch will resolve the issue.  PATCH INFORMATION =================  The attached patch resolves this issue      Xen unstable                               xsa18-unstable.patch  $ xsa18-unstable.patch  xsa18-unstable.patch -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =dD8C -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment "xsa18-unstable.patch" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
