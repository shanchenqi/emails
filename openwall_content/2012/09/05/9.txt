Credit Matthew Daley.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  PHYSDEVOP_map_pirq with MAP_PIRQ_TYPE_GSI does not range check map->index.  IMPACT ======  A malicious HVM guest kernel can crash the host.  It might also be able to read hypervisor or guest memory.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen systems running HVM guests.  PV guests are not vulnerable.  The vulnerability dates back to Xen 4.1.  Xen 4.0 is not vulnerable. 4.1, the 4.2 RCs, and xen-unstable.hg are vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  This issue can be mitigated by ensuring that the guest kernel is trustworthy, or by running only PV guests.
