I wonder about the severity of the issue, but given the possibility that  applications might access an array before a fill, and applications may  depend on there being "empty" elements after initialization, this seems  reasonable for a CVE.  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
