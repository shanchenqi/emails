An attacker could use this flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information.  References (including the reproducer, workaround and further details): [1] [2]  Could you allocate a CVE id for this?  Thank you && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team  P.S.:  Issue brought to us by Florian Weimer, Red Hat Product Security Team        (for case someone is tracking the initial reporter)  P.S#2: Oracle Security Team Cc-ed on this request too (to clarify        if CVE id has been assigned to this already or not).
