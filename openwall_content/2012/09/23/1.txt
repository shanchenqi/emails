Agreed, and the "still modified with the user's umask" portion is very important.  I assume you mean orig.st_mode & ~umask.  With open(..., O_CREAT | ..., orig.st_mode) this does not need to be explicit, but with fchmod() it does.  (Sorry for stating the obvious, but I am concerned that someone might patch GnuPG to just chmod to the original file's perms ignoring umask, which would be a dangerous change of behavior.)
