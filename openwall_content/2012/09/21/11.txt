Really the > point  No, security vulnerabilities qualify, security hardening does not necessarily qualify.  In this case GnuPG respects umask. We can't assign a CVE for every single program that has potentially sensitive output and fails to ensure that the output is mode or whatever (what about extended access controls?). Some programs choose to enforce permissions within themselves (e.g. OpenSSH and key based authentication), but generally speaking makeing sure a program with potentially sensitive output is safe is the job of the system configuration, and you have several options:  1) a safe default umask 2) using safe directory permissions, for example in RHEL /home/$USER is not accessible by group or other  Again, it is nice if the program does this, but if the program does not it's not generally considered a security vulnerability (of course exceptions exist, for example servers that log username/password to a world readable log file for example). But this is not one of those exceptions.  > of CVE is increasing awareness.
