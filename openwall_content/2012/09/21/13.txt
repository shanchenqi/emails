Programs can't know what they're supposed to do unless you tell them. And we tell the system using umask.  > Again, about as minor as you could get, but its still an E.  I'm confused. It's not exposed unless you configure umask wrong and run this in a public viewable directory. If you want a CVE for every single program that doesn't ensure it's (potentially sensitive) output is mode than that's basically, well, all the programs on a system.  > Best wishes, Mike >    - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://www.enigmail.net/  =K+6A -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
