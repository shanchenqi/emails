I suppose the permissions respect the user's umask so I do not think this is a real security issue in the gpg itself. Although using the permissions of the original file when creating the decrypted/encrypted one (still modified with the user's umask) would be more appropriate. So in my opinion this does not warrant a CVE but improvement in the upstream gnupg code would be appreciated I think.  --  Tomas Mraz No matter how far down the wrong road you've gone, turn back.
