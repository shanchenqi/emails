Although I think that interpretation would be a safer way to go about things, but thinking about it more broadly, it may open a large can of worms.  Would such a situation in all other applications be considered an exposure?  So another vim example  $ umask $ echo test > test umask $ vim test :w test2 $ ls -l test2 -rw-r--r-- 1 a a 5 Sep 21 test2  Would this be an exposure since the user had original file permissions were and the derived file is now  So anyway, I suppose this creates more questions than answers, but I guess its worth thinking about.  After all, what did the user really expect?  If they had intended that original file to be private, and now its not, is that appropriate?  Is it more appropriate to assume all users know how to use umask appropriately?
