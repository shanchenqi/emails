There are problems with handling of DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS environment variable in both libdbus and glib/libgio when used in a privileged (setuid or setgid) application.  libdbus is currently tracked via with two known attack variants: - unixexec:, which is only supported in recent dbus versions (1.5+ from   what I can see) - autolaunch: combined with malicious PATH setting, leading to   execution of the attacker's dbus-launch.  This affects pre-1.5 dbus   versions too.  libgio got - autolaunch: or empty address, combined with PATH setting, similar to   the second libdbus variant  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
