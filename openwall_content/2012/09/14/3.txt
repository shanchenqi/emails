I do not have that information yet. The information about intended CVE assignment till October update was exchanged off list, contact on Oracle side was Mr. Mehnert.  Early disclosure of this issue was due to misconception, that Oracle would have assessed severity, need for CVE and communication of disclosure timeline before releasing patch as maintenance release. The early disclosure mixed up the whole reporting/analyze/classify/CVE-assign/disclosure process somehow.
