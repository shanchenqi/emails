It uses the umask.  IMO, any  attempt to add another check in the shell to make a newly created file  retain the permissions of whatever input it was derived from would be a  misguided effort, and likely to cause breakage.  Any script that cares  about this should already be controlling the permissions through the  umask, and having the output file's access created in a way that does  not respect the umask could be an unwelcome surprise.
