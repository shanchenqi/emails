Setting as a default for gpg is I suppose a step, but gpg is not the only application handling sensitive data. If that is the case, then there are a whole lot of other applications also not doing the right thing with your sensitive data including those that pipe and redirect stdin/stdout.  Again, I don't know how to make it any clearer, but I'm considering the broader implications, not just gpg.  I still don't understand again why gpg is so special?
