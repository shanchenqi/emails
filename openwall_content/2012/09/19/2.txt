Note: Test-suite add-on, no CVE needed.  7) Fixed RPM builds by including the $(DESTDIR) prefix for uninstall-local and    install-exec-hook stages in Makefile.am.    Upstream patch:    [5]        Note: Also doesn't look like a fix for a security flaw.  Could you allocate CVE ids for issues 1), 2), 3), and 4) ?  [Cc-ed Damien and Michael from fwknop upstream to confirm they {the first four} should receive a CVE identifier].
