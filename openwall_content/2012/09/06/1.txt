A buffer overflow was reported [1],[2] in mcrypt version and earlier due to a boundary error in the processing of an encrypted file (via the check_file_head() function in src/extra.c).  If a user were tricked into attempting to decrypt a specially-crafted .nc encrypted flie, this flaw would cause a stack-based buffer overflow that could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.
