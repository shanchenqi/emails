I'm attaching a patch that makes mcrypt abort when the salt is longer than  the temp buffer it uses.  While working on it, I noticed the err_ functions do not have a constant  printf format, yet there are calls such as:       sprintf(tmperr, _("Input File: %s\n"), infile);       err_info(tmperr); [print_enc_info in src/extra.c]  And a few others in src/mcrypt.c; for instance: $ mcrypt --no-openpgp "%s.nc"  mcrypt: h���Fn�`.nc is not a regular file. Skipping...  I'm attaching another patch that prevents the format string attacks.
