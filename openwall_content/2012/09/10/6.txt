Vincent Untz says that the browser plugin doesn't actually install the extensions, it's passed to another process via a dbus call to gnome-shell, which sends the uuid of the extension to the extensions.gnome.org web site in order to download the extension.  See:  http://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-shell/tree/js/ui/extensionDownloader.js#n27  which is:  let message = Soup.form_request_new_from_hash('GET', REPOSITORY_URL_INFO, params);  And REPOSITORY_URL_INFO is hardcoded earlier:  const REPOSITORY_URL_BASE = 'https://extensions.gnome.org'; const REPOSITORY_URL_DOWNLOAD = REPOSITORY_URL_BASE + '/download-extension/%s.shell-extension.zip'; const REPOSITORY_URL_INFO     = REPOSITORY_URL_BASE + '/extension-info/'; const REPOSITORY_URL_UPDATE   = REPOSITORY_URL_BASE + '/update-info/';  I don't think this is something that can be exploited, based on the above.  --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
