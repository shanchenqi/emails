I should have probably mentioned this before for those reviewing the patch  (or better, added a comment to the patch): Even though the patch checks for salt_size > sizeof(tmp_buf) which is  and later the memmove copies to decrypt_general() (src/classic.c)'s  local_salt, which is the salt_size can't be an odd number (it is  decreased by one to make it even-numbered). So, there can't be a one-byte  overflow.  > >I'm attaching another patch that prevents the format string attacks. >  > Fantastic, thanks for this.

I didn't spend much time on them, but none seemed to be exploitable.
