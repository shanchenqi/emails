The second one there is remained affected; fixed in  We are more specific on our version pages. From   * Fix unfiltered HTML capabilities in multisite (this is  * Fix possible privilege escalation in the Atom Publishing Protocol endpoint  * Allow operations on network plugins only through the network admin  Details for the other two:   * AtomPub allowed contributors to publish posts, which is normally reserved for users of an author role or higher. This should be considered low risk, low impact. An additional mitigating factor is that AtomPub is off by default and rarely enabled. (In WordPress 3.5, AtomPub will no longer be a part of core.)   * For multisite, plugins that must be activated network-wide could be activated by a non-network administrator. This is only if they were already installed by a network administrator, but left inactive. This could also only occur if the network administrator allowed individual site administrators to manage plugins -- by default, this is not the case, and it is rare.
