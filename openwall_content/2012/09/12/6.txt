As a quick fix, the exploit can also be mitigated by properly placing the dbus-launch binary into the expected path, usually "/bin/dbus-launch", e.g.  # ln -s /usr/bin/dbus-launch /bin/dbus-launch  since for some reason, on most dists the binary is mis-placed into /usr/bin. This makes an execv() fail in libdbus itself, triggering an execvp().  Sebastian  ----- Forwarded message from Sebastian Krahmer <krahmer@...e.de> -----   Hi,  The recently discussed libdbus getenv() issue [1] turned out to be easily exploitable on various UNIX systems, including some Linux distributions. Common attack vectors are Xorg and spice-gtk via auto-launching [2]. Properly patching requires fixes for libdbus and libgio, depending on which you link your suid binaries. Would be nice if someone from RH could forward their patch, as they have some developers upstream and possibly access to the private git commit (they also already assigned this CVE). My CRD proposal is Sept. 12th. As can be seen in [1], this issue is indeed public since 1+ year.
