Granting and revoking roles from a user is not reflected upon token validation for pre-existing tokens. Pre-existing tokens continue to be valid for the original set of roles for the remainder of the token's lifespan, or until explicitly invalidated. This fix invalidates all tokens held by a user upon role grant/revoke to circumvent the issue.  Folsom fix:  Essex fix:  References:  Notes: This fix will be included in the future Keystone stable update and the upcoming Folsom-RC1 development milestone.  - --  Thierry Carrez (ttx) OpenStack Vulnerability Management Team -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://www.enigmail.net/  bggBCxcI2PLQgjuWyF4M =+6UN -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
