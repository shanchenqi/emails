Even though the above is not correct to the best of my knowledge (no openssh version I checked would call OPENSSL_config(NULL) from ssh-keysign, even when it's complied with --with-ssl-engine and installed setuid root; even though other openssh command line tools do end up calling OPENSSL_config(NULL)), this shows OpenSSL is not unlikely to be used in a privileged application and hence may allow privilege escalation via special OPENSSL_CONF or OPENSSL_ENGINES environment variables.  OpenSSL also already protects access to certain environment variables (there are OPENSSL_issetugid() calls before getenv()), it does not do the same check for all variables it reads.  It seems that problem deserves a CVE.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
