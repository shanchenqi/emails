If a user were to have vino enabled (including requiring authentication), a remote user could access the port and see anything the user added to the clipboard sent over the port.  To reproduce, enable vino with password protection (i.e. execute vino-preferences).  Connect to the VNC port (either locally or remotely), for instance:  % nc -4 odvfc17 RFB @??zsh: command not found: zsh:@??[vdanen@...fc17]  The above two bits of output are from copying in the GNOME terminal, locally, on the system running vino.  The above was tested with Fedora 17's version; the report indicates that on Gentoo and on Debian are also vulnerable.  References:   I did a quick attempt to reproduce this with but was unable to reproduce it, so somewhere between and this became a problem.  I've not dug into it further to see which version introduced this.  There's no response in the upstream bug either, so no patches are available that I can see.  --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
