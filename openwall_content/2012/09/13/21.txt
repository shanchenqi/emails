Please note that one of the list requirements is that issues be embargoed (kept private) for 2 weeks at most (e.g. 14 to 16 days depending on when during the week the email was sent). DO NOT SEND A REQUEST TO THIS LIST IF YOU NEED MORE THAN 2 WEEKS TO ADDRESS AND RELEASE THE ISSUE. The distros@ list is a private list consisting of security teams for Linux and BSD distributions. No archives of this list exist publicly at this time, although a time delayed archive may be created at some point (delayed at least days so embargoed issues don't appear in the archives). The advantage of this list is it allows you to easily co-ordinate a public release with the projects most likely to ship your software (e.g. Linux and BSD vendors).  Time line: I generally respond to these within one business day, this means you'll either get a CVE or a request for more information if the request is not properly formatted or is unclear/missing details/etc.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://www.enigmail.net/  =DOt0 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
