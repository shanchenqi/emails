The general issue of interface listening in an NTP daemon's configuration is perhaps best covered by CCE. (in the document) is one related identifier.  >The configuration uses "restrict" statements to restrict querying and >modification to LAN side only.  >Following scenarios come to my mind with the interfaces default >configuration  Do all of these scenarios require a host and network configuration that accepts packets with LAN source IP addresses even if these packets arrive from the Internet interface? Typically it's not the responsibility of an individual network application program to address those scenarios. If an application program tried to address such a scenario but had an implementation error (e.g., it documented as a hardcoded safe network but actually had hardcoded), that's a different situation and a CVE could be assigned.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =kVUT -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
