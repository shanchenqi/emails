But oss-security  is for the discussion of previously disclosed issues that affect F/OSS.  There  are doubtless some edge cases but I don't believe that the discussion of an  issue relating to BIG-IP F5s (a commerical, closed source product) has any  relevance to the oss-security list.   Please try and ensure you only email  this list when you require action from F/OSS developers and/or distributions.
