FWIW, I have added a check to unix-privesc-check for privileged binaries that  have "PATH=" embedded in them and run it over a couple of fairly vanilla  Debian systems with KDE on it and seen a few other cases of embedded PATHs.   This yielded a few cases where "privileged" binaries trust  /usr/local/{bin/sbin} but nothing else untoward. trunk is currently in flux,  but vendors may wish to incorporate it into their release testing in due  course.
