I was under impression that YGN Ethical Hacker Group knew what this list was for, after they had made multiple on topic postings in the past.  Some [smaller] router firmware is in fact Open Source.  I'm sorry that, as a list moderator, I let YEHG's original posting and a follow-up through.  We'll reject further postings to this thread, unless there are any on list policies and such rather than on the off-topic vulnerability.
