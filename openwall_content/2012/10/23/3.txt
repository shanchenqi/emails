Any attacker who wants to find the  vulnerability will, quickly. Not giving out information really only  harms the people that actually benefit from knowing (e.g. your users  and vendors, it's just one more thing to figure out).   - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT)   A90B 66BF   -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----   GnuPG (GNU/Linux)               =OfJF  -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----   Powered by UserVoice.
