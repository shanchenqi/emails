The module doesn't sufficiently validate css import statements to confirm they only include css content appropriate to show to end users. This could allow a malicious user to add sensitive content from the site (e.g. settings.php) exposing that sensitive content to visitors of the page. It could also be used to execute a Cross Site Scripting attack.  Links to the code commits fixing this would be helpful.  > | - Hotblocks - > Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and Denial of Service (DoS)  This is a multiple CVE issue?  > | - Custom > Publishing Options - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability  > | - Elegant > Theme - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) | > - Activism - Access Bypass >  >  >  > Multiple Vulnerabilities: | > - Jstool - Access Bypass  > | - Jstool - > Arbitrary code inclusion  The description/vulns don't seem to match up on this one. Can you clarify?  The module does not protect its menu paths, which contain sensitive information about all javascript files on the site and their contents. The module does not validate filenames which can lead to potential read/write access to arbitrary files on the server.  Links to the code commits fixing this would be helpful.  > | - Email Field > - Access Bypass | > - Announcements - Access Bypass   > | - Taxonomy > Image - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) & Arbitrary PHP code execution So this is the same root issue, not filtering file uploads allowing an attacker to upload arbitrary stuff (including PHP code), the outcome of which could be PHP code execution, or XSS (or other things I suppose like DoS, CSRF, etc.)?   > Thanks, Josh - on behalf of the Drupal security team.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://www.enigmail.net/  SLMDKmKG4YtdCRTrFpob =gXGG -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
