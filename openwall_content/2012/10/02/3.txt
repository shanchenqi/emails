He had reported that it writes to a file called "list" in the current working directory without first checking to see if it existed, so it could be used to clobber other user's files, if executed as root.  Our current versions of Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 use this vulnerable genkey.pl script; earlier versions did not have the vulnerable bits.  Looking at it a bit further, it seems like there's a few other places where it clobbers files.  Our bug report is here:   I've also got in there a patch that uses the File::Temp to create temporary files properly (somewhat tested).  Just a heads-up in case anyone else is shipping this perl script as well.  The name was assigned to this issue.  --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
