Windows has system environment variables, such as PATH, that      apply to all users.    2. On Windows, the installation procedure for a product sometimes      results (through different mechanisms) in a modified PATH that      references the product's installation directory.    3. The permissions of the installation directory might be unsafe.    4. Some other software, including software shipped by Microsoft,      relies on the PATH containing only safe directories.  One example of an open-source product:  http://www.php.net/manual/en/faq.installation.php#faq.installation.addtopath says to add C:\php to the PATH, but doesn't suggest checking the permissions of C:\php before doing this. In this case, the situation probably should not be described as a vulnerability in the PHP software. It could perhaps be considered a security-related documentation issue.  One example of another product:  has an installation option related to PATH:    PERL_PATH: If set to 'No', the Perl/bin directory will not be added to   the system PATH environment variable.  and possibly the default is 'Yes' in some or all versions. Here, there is a better argument that this is a vulnerability in the product, because (according to the disclosure) the installation software itself can make an unsafe PATH change.  One possible security guideline is that all products that automatically modify PATH during installation should be checking all relevant directory permissions first. This is, however, not the only possible way to address the underlying problem or problems. It is currently unclear whether there should be a CVE entry for every product that handles this PATH issue in any potentially unsafe way.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =8yEd -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
