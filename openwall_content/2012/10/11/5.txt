If you look at the TLS file in the source tarball, it indicates that checking server certificates is not implemented and is something to add in the future:  TODO: * Check server certificate for changes and notify about it. * Diffrent Certificate and Key file?  Since sSMTP clearly indicates that this feature is missing and unsupported, then it was designed to _not_ do certificate checking. Regardless of how good or bad that is, it was a design choice (to leave it for a later date), and it's also clearly documented.  To me, that doesn't seem like a security flaw (as in sSMTP was designed to check certificates and didn't or didn't do a good job of it).  --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
