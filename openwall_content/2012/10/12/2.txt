Since cups-pk-helper is running as root, this could lead to uploading sensitive data to a cups resource, or overwriting specific files with the content of a cups resource. The flaw is however mitigated by the fact that it cannot be exploited without the user explicitly approving the action (via polkit authentication with the admin password).  This has been fixed in cups-pk-helper    Thanks to Sebastian Krahmer and Alexander Peslyak for their help in reviewing the fix.  Reference:  About cups-pk-helper:   cups-pk-helper is a PolicyKit helper to configure cups with   fine-grained privileges.
