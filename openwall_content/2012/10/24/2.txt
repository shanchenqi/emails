Exploits, I agree. But more information will let people make a decision as to whether they're vulnerable, and how much pain it's worth going through to either upgrade to a fixed version or backport the fix.  > Supporting researchers to find security bugs in open source projects, > however has helped us a lot: http://piwik.org/security/  So this page has a link, "You can see the previous Security issues in Piwik" pointing at http://piwik.org/blog/category/security/. The last entry on here referring to an issue with piwik itself is from June but 4 releases since then have included security fixes, several of them rated "critical" on the changelog page. I wonder if it might be better to just refer to the changelog if the separate page can't be kept updated?  Unfortunately many of the releases with security fixes coincide with warnings like "This new version contains database schema changes so please be careful when running the Update script", anything more than complicated than "update the installed files" is going to restrict the number of users who keep up-to-date with security fixes.  In particular some OS distributions package piwik; if they would like to fix the problems in a stable release (where it's not possible to force schema changes etc), with the current process each different OS packaging piwik would need to isolate the diff themselves and hope they include all needed parts,  As a packager I don't necessarily think an upstream project needs to continually maintain security fixes for old releases, but at least posting information about the actual bugs fixed with a reference to the commit/s would make life a lot easier for the people who help many of your users stay on top of security fixes.
