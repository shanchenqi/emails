I simply pointed out that trying to hide details of an issue is only going to annoy legitimate users/vendors and does not to actually protect against attackers who also know how to use diff. Transparency in the security process is important, it helps build trust, and it helps users/vendors deal with the issues more quickly and efficiently.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  xiAyZYYPtHTgvebejEe+ =1HLT -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
