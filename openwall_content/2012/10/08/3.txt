Hostapd has a function eap_server_tls_process_fragment() used by its internal EAP authentication server for handling fragmented EAP-TLS messages. The function (indirectly) calls wpabuf_overflow() aborting the application in case of potential buffer overflows. Such a situation can be triggered by an attacker sending an EAP-TLS message with      a) the "More Fragments" flag set and     b) an "TLS Message Length" value that is smaller than the size of        the "TLS Data" field.  The vulnerability can be exploited only if hostapd is configured to use its internal EAP authentication server, either directly for IEEE or when using hostapd as a RADIUS authentication server.   Affected is hostapd in versions 0.6 - 1.0.
