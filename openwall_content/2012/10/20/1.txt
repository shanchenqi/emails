OVERVIEW  F5 FirePass SSL VPN is vulnerable to Open URL Redirection.   2. BACKGROUND  F5 FirePass SSL VPN provides secure remote access to enterprise applications and data for users over any device or network while protecting your corporate. (See http://www.f5.com/pdf/products/firepass-overview.pdf)   3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION  F5 FirePass SSL VPN contains a flaw that allows a remote cross site redirection attack. This flaw exists because the application does not validate the "refreshURL" parameter upon submission to the "my.activation.cns.php3" script. This could allow a user to create a specially crafted URL, that if clicked, would redirect a victim from the intended legitimate web site to an arbitrary web site of the attacker's choosing.   4.
