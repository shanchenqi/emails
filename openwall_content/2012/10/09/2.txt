Perhaps one of the Creative Commons licenses would be it, please feel free to suggest one if you like.  Also, reuse of individual slides may fall under fair use, like I am reusing a slide on multi-factor authentication from Duo Security's presentation (I had informed Dug Song of my intent to reuse the slide, though):   BTW, here is the original:  https://speakerdeck.com/u/duosec/p/modern-two-factor-authentication-defending-against-user-targeted-attacks  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
