Armed with this excuse, let me tell you that I made two presentations on password hashing this year.  It's everything you wanted to know about password hashing since to present day and the near future, and more. ;-)  Password security: past, present, future (with strong bias towards password hashing)  Password hashing at scale (for Internet companies with millions of users)  Discussion of the latter at /r/crypto: http://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/10zjdo/password_hashing_for_orgs_with_millions_of_users/  and on john-users (click "thread-next"): (I intend to reply to the questions raised further in that thread.)  SHA-3 is deliberately not mentioned on the slides yet.  I briefly thought of retroactively adding a few mentions of it (YaC was a day too early), but decided not to.  SHA-3 should be similar to DES (read: very good) in context of possible defensive use of FPGAs.  As to PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-3, things are less clear, although it's probably weaker than (is it also weaker than than -SHA-1? not sure).  (In this context, "weaker" means it allows for even more efficient attack-optimized implementations than the other hash type, resulting in higher passwords tested per second rate for the same processing cost of defensive use.)  I prefer to keep only fairly reliable information on the slides, and not speculate on important issues there (but I do speculate here, as you can see).  Those of you who follow @solardiz on Twitter probably already know a bit more on my expectations and reasoning for throughput-optimized parallelized implementations of SHA-3, due to the too-many-tweet conversation I had with @marshray. ;-)  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
