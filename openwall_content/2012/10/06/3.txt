At least the CVE is not listed in Mitre's list, OSVDB, Secunia or Debian security-tracker. Request done in:  """ piwigo: a1) CSRF a2) SQL injection a3) stored XSS (the issues mentioned by the exploit-db entry appear to be the same that  were fixed in b) search.php SQL injection c) CSRF in the admin panel: (the exploit-db entry details two other issues, but are "admin-only" -- feel  free to assign or ignore those.) """   I am happy to provide more information if needed (or in clearner format). Please double-verify that these haven't been assigned before you assign IDs, please.  - Henri Salo  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
