For context, the stripslashes/strip_tags'ed POST variable is  included in the template as following: <input type="text" id="username_or_email" name="username_or_email" ...  value="{$username_or_email}">  (some parts redacted for clarity)  So, two ids are needed. Thanks in advance.  Piwigo also seems to be affected but doesn't.  --  Raphael Geissert - Debian Developer www.debian.org - get.debian.net  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
