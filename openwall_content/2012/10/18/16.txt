Part of it also depends on usage. Google labels everything as a Beta, sometimes for years and with millions of users. My experience is a lot of people use Debian unstable (when I used Debian I did, otherwise everything was to boring =). What would be interesting is if you could provide download statistics from the main site. I know for a fact CVE's have been assigned for publicly released applications that are probably in use by less than or in extreme cases possibly less than 10 people globally.  > Best wishes, Mike  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://www.enigmail.net/  =dSbi -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
