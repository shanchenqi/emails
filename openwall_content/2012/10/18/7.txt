Based on Changes:   [1]  I would say this is:   "* Added MULTIPART_INVALID_PART flag. Also used in rule id for multipart strict"  with relevant upstream commit being:   [2]  but Cc-in Breno Silva to definitely confirm this yet.  Breno, could you please confirm / disprove that the patch [2] is upstream patch for issue:   [3] ?  And if it's not the correct one, provide an explicit revision link to the proper one?
