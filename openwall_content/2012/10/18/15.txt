So, at the risk of sounding nitpicky, the Debian testing + unstable archives are pretty much equivalent to Fedora rawhide.  Even though Redhat's position is that issues affecting only rawhide should not get CVE identifiers, in Debian I think we should try to be more honest, so we'll assign identifiers to all "uploaded" versions (in Debian, we use the term upload to mean that a package is available in an archive vice the term release).
