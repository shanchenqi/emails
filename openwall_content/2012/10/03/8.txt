All issues are fixed in the same upstream patch but some issues in that patch affect different versions. I'll use the notation from "CVE Abstraction Content Decisions: Rationale and Application" to describe how I see it:  S1: The vulnerability found in exc_to_s() S2: The vulnerability found in name_err_to_s() S3: The vulnerability found in name_err_mesg_to_str()  S1, S2 and S3 are the same type of bug. S1 and S2 appear in the same versions and newer), so MERGE them. S3 appears in 1.8.x, as well as and newer, so SPLIT it from S1 and S2.
