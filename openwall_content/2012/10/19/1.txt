Raphael, please clarify.  They are different issues. The closest is  I didn't look much into those other buffers as they would require an attacker  to control the arguments passed to mcrypt(1) to exploit them.  Kurt, regarding the issues in [4], I don't know what other reference you  want me to add. There's nothing more than what's on the thread.
