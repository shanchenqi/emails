The root cause of this is the same as reported by Chris Rohlf which affected WebKit.  2) The Konqueror web browser is vulnerable to an out of bounds memory access when accessing the canvas.  In this case the vulnerability was identified whilst playing with bug from Google's Chrome repository.  3) The Konqueror web browser is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference leading to a crash.  4) The Konqueror web browser is vulnerable to a "use-after-free" class flaw when the context menu is used whilst the document DOM that is being changed from within Javascript.  These flaws were identified during an analysis of previously reported vulnerabilities that affected Google's Chrome web browser.  It is believed that only vulnerability 1 is/was common to the two code bases.  --8<--------  I'm pre-advising on these flaws since I've not heard anything from the KDE  project in about 8 months regarding 3 and 4 and we are aware that 1 and 2 have  been fixed.  I'll give it 7 days and then drop technical details.  Vendors with  an interest can contact me off list.
