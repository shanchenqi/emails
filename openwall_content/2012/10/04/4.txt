Just to verify the process is for multiple vulnerabilities which Drupal issued one advisory about. In the past I think these got separate CVE's and we have in our process to report it once for each vulnerability. Which leads to the questions: 1) Should it have multiple CVE's? 2) Should we be reporting these separately or all on one?
