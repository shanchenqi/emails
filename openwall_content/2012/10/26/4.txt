It's pretty scary in there.  If I was to list the security problems I found after a few minutes of looking, they are:  * It uses MD5 passwords * The shadow file is directly modified without locking (which could lead to a     race condition) * If you get the password wrong, it doesn't unlink the empty temporary file.  None are really a big deal, you *could* run this and probably never notice these problems.  Fundamentally though, this thing should get one CVE ID that basically say "don't use this". How have situations like this been handled in the past?  I mailed the Squirrelmail security team. They never responded. Regardless of their response though, the plugin site says it has been downloaded more than times, so I suspect it's still in use somewhere. My goal in this CVE request is to raise awareness so hopefully people stop using this (and get the Squirrelmail guys to remove it from their site).  Thanks.  --      JB  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
