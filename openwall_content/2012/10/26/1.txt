One question, in (the last Awstats open redirect): Steve:  CONFIRM:http://awstats.sourceforge.net/docs/awstats_changelog.txt  Is it possible to include more information in the references like a line of text or the data it was pulled or something? I'm noticing this more and more as I try to verify stuff, could we consider adding a notes field or something?  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  iQIcBAEBAgAGBQJQiiNoAAoJEBYNRVNeJnmTSbcQAJvzJKn/SF6GewIgStgOsRcM TVsWRQOzhHntznXjVWEr =e9t/ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
