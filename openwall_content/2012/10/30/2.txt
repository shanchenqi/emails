Right but the problem is people aren't going to audit these stinky old softwares to find CVE's, it's just not worth it mostly (what's the incentive?).  >> We can assign a CVE with a description along the lines of >> "Software X has not been actively maintained since release Y on >> date Z.

Hence the model. You take things into account like what language was used, what the software does, it's track record, and the person/team writing it and so on. In this case DJB has a pretty good track record, so statistically speaking qmail is on the safer side and probably doesn't need a CVE anytime soon. This isn't simple "if release >=5 years assign cve=true" =).  >> In effect this would be a blacklist/greylist of software, and by >> using CVE it would be able to piggy back on the existing CVE >> ecosystem (no better word to use), e.g. scanners would pick up >> the old versions and >  > I'll grant that the CVE ecosystem is large and potentially very > powerful Force For Good, if deployed this way. >  > But when a consumer asks, "Is fixed?" and the answer > is "one guy put together three releases the last two months, fixing > one bug each", what _is_ the answer?

Or "No" because two months is > insufficient data to draw a conclusion?  1) I suspect we'll be assigning this to very dead software so I think it's highly unlikely that any updates ever got shipped. 2) if it happens it's basically "fixed" by the new release. but again I seriously doubt we'll run into this anytime soon.  >> I realize this looks a LOT like feature creep with respect to >> CVE, but I think it falls into the definition of a vulnerability >> closely enough that it makes sense/won't result in a huge mess.

But this is already being heavily eroded by firms like Oracle:  http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=unknown  The reality is we already have hundreds of CVE entries with absolutely no significant details other than a product name and version and vague terms as whether or not Confidentiality/Accessibility/Integrity might be affected.  > I also think your idea has merit -- there is too much never-loved  > software out there -- but I don't think CVE is the correct lever > to attack it.  The problem is we have this ecosystem of CVE software from scanners like Nessus to firms like iDefense/iSIGHT. Using CVE would quickly give this old and problematic software problems high visibility, CVE is:  "International in scope and free for public use, CVE is a dictionary of publicly known information security vulnerabilities and exposures."  > Thanks    - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =s5+Q -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
