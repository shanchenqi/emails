That's not the same as a generic "don't use this."  For this  there is a specific advisory from a specific vendor telling  customers to patch a vulnerability.  It's "unspecified" all over the place  due to lack of details, so risk analysis is problematic, but it's a  statement of some kind of vulnerability in a specifc version by an  authoritative source.  Oracle and HP publish advisories like this on a regular basis.  >> Deployment of risky software is effectively a configuration or >> asset management issue, which is well outside the scope of CVE. >> (Maybe it's more like a Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE) >> issue.) > > If anything I think it would fit into CPE  CPE is neutral on security - it's just about identifying software packages  and versions.  One main use is in vulnerability management, but it's more  general than that.  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
