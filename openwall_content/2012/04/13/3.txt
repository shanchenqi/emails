Yes, doesn't look so one got assigned for this one yet, since: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=openjpeg  provides just recent To the:  http://code.google.com/p/openjpeg/issues/detail?id=5  issue itself:  1) It should get a identifier (upstream ticket is public from  2) From the issue reasons investigation, it seems to be combination of heap-based buffer invalid reads and writes by processing certain Gray16 TIFF images, leading to invalid free (when such corrupted memory allocated for tile encoder / decoder handle (TCD) is attempted to be freed).  More official description in Red Hat bug:  Kurt, could you allocate a CVE id?
