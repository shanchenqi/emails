Steps to reproduce: 1. sleep 3; pcmanfm 2. slock 3. press some buttons 4. now black screen will go away and you can see the current active desktop  This is a critical vulnerability. I recommend blocking this package.  I'm running xmonad on amd64.  Longpoke UTC  You need to run the other program *concurrently*. I'll try and make the reproduction steps clearer:  1. run sleep <n>; <X-program> 2. lock the screen as fast as you can 3. make sure <n> seconds has passed, so that you know <X-program> has started 4. press some keys (any keys (doesn't have to be your actual password), don't hit enter)  Now the black screen will go away and you can see the current active desktop along with <X-program>.  Where <X-program> is the name of some X program that will create a window and leave it open when executed, i.e: pcmanfm.  --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
