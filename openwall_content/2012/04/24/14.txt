Anyway:  Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,     a denial of service flaw was found in the way the bind-dyndb-ldap, a dynamic LDAP back-end plug-in for BIND providing LDAP database back-end capabilities, performed LDAP connection errors handling / attempted to recover, when an error during a LDAP search happened for a particular DNS query. When the Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) server was patched to support dynamic loading of database back-ends, and the LDAP database back-end was enabled, a remote attacker could use this flaw to cause denial of service (named process hang) via DNS query for zone served by bind-dyndb-ldap.  bind-dyndb-ldap backend upstream commit, which introduced the problem: [1]   Preliminary bind-dyndb-ldap back-end upstream patch from Adam Tkac: [2]  References: [3] [4]  Note: Just to explicitly note this. This is NOT a bind DoS in the sense        upstream bind source package would be affected by it. Bind        needs to be first patched to support dynamic loading of database        backends and it's an error in the LDAP backend (bind-dyndb-ldap        source code) which makes this attack to succeed when a specially-crafted        DNS query is issued.  Could you allocate a CVE id for this?
