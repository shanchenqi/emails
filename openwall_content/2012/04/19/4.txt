The packaging of munin node determines whether it will install symlinks for enabling plugins. The packaging of munin master determines whether a configuration for your httpd is installed and activated.  On Debian, symlinks to enable plugins are installed by default, and an apache2 configuration is automatically activated. So, on Debian, if your httpd is publicly-accessible, the munin pages and CGI will be publicly-accessible.  --  Kenyon Ralph  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
