Hi,  while reviewing a expat regression (likely caused by the hash collision denial of service fix, but unclear) i stumbled about the randomness it uses.  	static unsigned long 	generate_hash_secret_salt(void) 	{ 	  unsigned int seed = time(NULL) % UINT_MAX; 	  srand(seed); 	  return rand(); 	}  and it is seeded once at parser object creation.  This is better than not seeding, but I am not sure if it is sufficient.
