Especially when considering that many xml docs contain a timestamp of when they were generated, making the issue that much worse.  --  Andreas Ericsson                   andreas.ericsson@....se OP5 AB                             www.op5.se Tel: +46                  Fax: +46  Considering the successes of the wars on alcohol, poverty, drugs and terror, I think we should give some serious thought to declaring war on peace.
