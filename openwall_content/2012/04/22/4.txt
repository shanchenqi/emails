A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted URL, which once visited by a valid DokuWiki user would lead to arbitrary HTML or web script execution in the context of logged in DokuWiki user.

(one is enough because only 'target' parameter isn't properly escaped, leading to XSS or CSRF {see [2] for further examples})  Thank you && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
