FWIW, trying these two on OpenSSL (the Owl package, which includes some unrelated patches), I get:  build: $ printf | openssl -inform DER Segmentation fault $ openssl -inform DER < unable to load certificate encoding routines:ASN1_CHECK_TLEN:wrong encoding routines:ASN1_ITEM_EX_D2I:nested asn1  build: $ printf | openssl -inform DER unable to load certificate encoding routines:ASN1_get_object:header too $ openssl -inform DER < unable to load certificate encoding routines:ASN1_CHECK_TLEN:wrong encoding routines:ASN1_ITEM_EX_D2I:nested asn1  So no luck triggering a crash on 32-bit, although we must patch the issue on 32-bit as well.  I'm not sure if I am using the larger testcase correctly, though.  I am not familiar with this.  The smaller testcase also triggers a segfault on OpenSSL (with unrelated patches) on  So not surprisingly some versions older than are vulnerable as well.
