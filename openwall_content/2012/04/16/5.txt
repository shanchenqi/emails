Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> CC: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: CVE Request (minor) -- Two Munin graphing framework flaws  Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,     the following three problems has been recently reported against Munin:    [1] Insecure temp file use in the qmailscan plug-in:                    [2] Possibility to inject escape sequences into Munin's log file:                    [3] Remote users can fill /tmp filesystem:        Red Hat would not consider this to be a security flaw =>        no RH BTS entry.         Original report:         For the first two -- though both of them having minor security impact, under suitable circumstances they could lead to trust boundary crossing => under our opinion they should get a identifiers.  For the third issue -- we wouldn't consider it to be a security flaw. Just as something, which on improperly configured machine could allow to fill in /tmp filesystem (just another way how to do it, when the particular service isn't properly configured).  Could you allocate CVE ids for the first two issues?  Thank you && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
