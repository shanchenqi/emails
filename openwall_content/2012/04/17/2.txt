The basic requirement is that a plugin called vmstat is configured for the node localhost.localdomain. I just picked it as an example, cause it is present on my system. In practise any plugin for any host will do.  The filling of the disk works by choosing a unique query string for each request, because munin "caches" all theses images without ever deleting them and includes the query string in the filename. So you are right, that we get a base amplification of 20k/request.  In addition munin parses parts of the query string. You are allowed to modify the size of the image. By choosing a path you can do the same attack while simultaneously using a large image size. The raw image would be (assuming 8bits/pixel) in this case. A png version will likely be smaller, say 4M? So now you have an amplification of 4M/request. Note that this query can get a node into swapping, because rrdtool needs to create the whole image in main memory.  Hope this helps  Helmut  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
