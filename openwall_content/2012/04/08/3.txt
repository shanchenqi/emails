They don't appear to have any real contact info.  Originally seen on Reddit, link to bug report:   Filed by "hakong" ======================== Details Through the client interface, I was able to chmod and chown the root directory (/) of my server to web3:client9 and using the "Add new Webdav user" by using ../../../../../../../../../../../../ as a path. This can probably be exploited in some way too. Just tried this on a fresh install of ISPConfig version and it worked, had to re-install the entire VM. This has to be fixed as soon as possible. ========================  Quick check of svn and generate log (to see revisions) and a diff (to look at the interesting revision, check date in bug report):  svn co svn://svn.ispconfig.org/ispconfig3/trunk/ cd trunk svn log -v --limit 10 | less svn diff -r >  and we then this:  Index: interface/web/sites/webdav_user_edit.php =================================================================== - --- interface/web/sites/webdav_user_edit.php	(revision +++ interface/web/sites/webdav_user_edit.php	(revision @@ @@  		 */  		if(isset($this->dataRecord['username']) && trim($this->dataRecord['username']) == '') $app->tform->errorMessage .= $app->tform->lng('username_error_empty').'<br />';  		if(isset($this->dataRecord['username']) && empty($this->dataRecord['parent_domain_id'])) $app->tform->errorMessage .= $app->tform->lng('parent_domain_id_error_empty').'<br />'; - - +		if(isset($this->dataRecord['dir']) && stristr($this->dataRecord['dir'],'..')) $app->tform->errorMessage .= $app->tform->lng('dir_dot_error').'<br />'; +		if(isset($this->dataRecord['dir']) && stristr($this->dataRecord['dir'],'./')) $app->tform->errorMessage .= $app->tform->lng('dir_slashdot_error').'<br />'; +		  		parent::onSubmit();  	}  Which confirms this flaw quite nicely.
