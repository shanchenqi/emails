I believe the XSS exists even without the backend. On review I'm less confident the CSRF is in the module or the service.  >> If you have any further suggestions on how we can improve the >> content or formatting of the SAs please let me know. > > Direct links to the code commits fixing them would be nice =)  We probably can't do this, though it is a fairly common request. Our current policy is not to discuss the specific details for at least 2 weeks and closer to 6 months if possible. Project usage shows that most site builders don't upgrade very quickly.  I didn't see an answer to my question about asking for CVE-identifier on Wednesdays after the SAs are released. I assumed that would be helpful so I just started doing that.  Thanks!
