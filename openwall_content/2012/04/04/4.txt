Sure, no doubt about that. The postgresql-jdbc package should have been updated a long time ago but obviously was forgotten. If we had updated it a year ago we'd have created a normal version update due to EOL of the old package with no security context at all. Now that it's known that the unsupported combination of versions allows for SQL injection however the update suddenly becomes security relevant.  cu Ludwig  --   (o_   Ludwig Nussel  //\  V_/_  http://www.suse.de/ SUSE LINUX Products GmbH, GF: Jeff Hawn, Jennifer Guild, Felix ImendĂśrffer, HRB (AG NĂźrnberg)   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
