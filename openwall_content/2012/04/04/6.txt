The problem is an integer overflow error in the "GetEXIFProperty()" function (magick/property.c, around line        number_bytes=(size_t) components*tag_bytes[format];  When processing EXIF directory entries with tags of e.g. format 5 (EXIF_FMT_URATIONAL) and a large components count, the calculation can overflow and e.g. lead to "number_bytes" being 0. If that's the case, subsequent checks can be bypassed, resulting in the loop in the "EXIFMultipleFractions" macro to iterate through a large number of "components". This leads to out-of-bound reads until eventually causing a segmentation fault when trying to read beyond the limits of heap memory.  An updated patch is available via the ImageMagick forum [1].  has been assigned to this issue.  Note: The initial patch for this issue is still necessary to prevent access of uninitialized/incorrect memory when e.g. processing specially crafted EXIF tags with a component count of 0.
