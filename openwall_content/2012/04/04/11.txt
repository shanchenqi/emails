Well, if you want to have a CVE for this, you should use a more complete description.  The actual scenario is that pre-8.2 versions of the JDBC driver do not know about the "standard_conforming_strings" option of more recent Postgres servers, and are insecure with *any* Postgres server in which that option is turned on, which has been possible since server version 8.2.  What changed in the 9.1 server is that that option is now on by default.  It's still possible (and will remain so for the foreseeable future) to turn the option off in the server configuration, making this and other ancient clients secure again.  But that isn't the default anymore.  			regards, tom lane  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
