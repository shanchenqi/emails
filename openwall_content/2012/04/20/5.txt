Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE request: kernel: fcaps: clear the same personality flags as suid  when fcaps are used  Reported by Steve Grubb, if a process increases permissions using fcaps all of the dangerous personality flags which are cleared for suid apps should also be cleared. Thus programs given priviledge with fcaps will continue to have address space randomization enabled even if the parent tried to disable it to make it easier to attack.
