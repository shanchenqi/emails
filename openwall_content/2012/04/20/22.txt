However, the patch for this issue was not applied correctly and hence the issue was not fixed as stated in the advisory.  A situation like this requires the assignment of a new, vendor-specific CVE for the broken/incomplete fix. Thus, has been assigned to this issue.  We apologize to upstream / distros for the confusion this additional CVE assignment may cause and want to make it explicit this is assigned to an issue in RHEL packages unlikely to affect anyone else (except of RHEL downstream distros).
