Is there a corresponding struct pid leak as well?  Most references to the pid namespace are through struct pid so that is an easy one to look at.  The previous issue vsftp ran into was network namespaces being slow to cleanup which is a very different issue, and I just double checked even if network namespaces were being slow to clean up it would not affect the pid namespace.  At the very least those pid namespaces are going to stay around until the parent process reaps the dead children, so in the trivial test case it may simply be that there is a difference how the slab cache is shrunk after pid namespaces are freed.
