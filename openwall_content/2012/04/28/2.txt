There are a few additional requirements.  Without some form of message authentication, chosen-ciphertext attacks are still possible even with a random IV.  > Because of this, and because the encryption key is shared for each > database table (fields and rows), the same plaintext prefix is > always encrypted to an identical and corresponding ciphertext > prefix.

That's why I'm not sure if it's actually possible to address this issue in a satisfying manner.
