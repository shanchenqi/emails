Recently, we have put some effort into fuzzing (Ramon de C Valle) and fixing (Panu Matilainen) RPM which resulted in fixes for couple of problems that exist on the code paths reachable before signature verification (when using rpm or package manager as yum).  Following CVEs were assigned, along with mapping to attached patches (for 4.8.x):  incorrect handling of negated offsets in headerVerifyInfo() region-trailer.patch  insufficient validation of region tags headerload-region.patch pkgread-region.patch  improper validation of header contents total size in headerLoad() region-size.patch Note: this fix is already in upstream git:  We plan to make these public next Tue, Apr3.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
