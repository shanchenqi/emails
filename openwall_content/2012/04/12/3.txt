Do you do any regression testing to make sure the new modules don't break things (if people know stuff is unlikely to break they are more likely to upgrade quickly, usually any ways).  > I didn't see an answer to my question about asking for > CVE-identifier on Wednesdays after the SAs are released.

I was just thinking, as long as the main project contributors/etc. (e.g. you guys in the case of Drupal) do the CVE requests in a regular and public way (e.g. to OSS-sec) than there is minimal chance of duplicates and other problems (e.g. someone else sending a request to Mitre directly or whatever).  > Thanks!
