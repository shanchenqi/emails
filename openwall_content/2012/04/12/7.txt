Just administrative note -- all of these security issues should get CVE identifiers, as all of the Ubuntu bugs have been reported in yet exactly).  On AM, David Black wrote: > Hi, I reported some bugs a while ago in cobbler which never received > CVE ID, could the follow bugs receive CVE ID ? > 1. lack of csrf protection in the cobbler web interface (vulnerable to > csrf attacks)  Some further references / patches information I was able to found: 1) Ubuntu patch by Robie Basak:      2) Red Hat bugzilla entry:      > 2. code execution on the cobbler host through use of yaml.loads on > potentially untrusted user input >  Though only yaml.load privilege escalation vector has been mentioned in this post, from further look noticed two ways for privilege escalation: 1) (possibly remote) privilege escalation via yaml.load / by     processing management parameters:      References:     (Ubuntu bug)      Ubuntu patch from Robie Basak:     * Backport safe YAML load from upstream. (LP:          (Red Hat bug)  2) local privilege escalation due to insecure use of PYTHON_EGG_CACHE location:      References:     (Ubuntu bug)     (upstream ticket)         (relevant upstream patch)     (Red Hat bug)  Kurt, could you allocate three CVE ids for these issues? i)   the first for CSRF issue, ii)  the second for the yaml.load priv esc issue, iii) the third for the PYTHON_EGG_CACHE local priv esc issue  David, would be great if you could confirm the three ids are necessary.
