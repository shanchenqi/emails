The following CVE-ID has been used: (privately assigned earlier by Kurt Seifried):  http://nginx.org/en/security_advisories.html  Description: a specially crafted mp4 file might allow to overwrite memory locations in a worker process, if ngx_http_mp4_module is  used, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution.  The mp4 module is not built in by default, and should be explicitly configured to be included in nginx.  By default nginx worker processes run under non-privileged user account.  The problem affects nginx versions newer than built with the ngx_http_mp4_module, and "mp4" directive in the configuration. To check if mp4 module is included in nginx build, use "nginx -V".  Users of nginx and mp4 pseudo-streaming module are kindly advised to upgrade to the latest nginx versions, or apply the following patch:     --  Andrew Alexeev @nginxorg   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
