If someone is able to confirm I matched them all up properly I would appreciate it.  We publish contributed module SAs on Wednesdays. Would it be helpful for future assignments to send a request at the end of the day? As discussed previously, it's not currently feasible to ask in advance for CVEs because coordination with the contributed module maintainers is not reliable enough to be done inside the embargo window.  I had a few questions/comments as I updated these - inline below:  "NO Video - > >  While the backend service and module are no longer active, there are 70 sites using this module who are vulnerable to CSRF/XSS. What is the reason not to give it a CVE?   > "NO Engage - Sensitive Data > Protection >  We debated a bit about this one and whether to make it an SA or not. In the end we decided that if a module were persisting the password in plain text that would deserve an SA so this one (persisting a login token in plain text) should also get an SA. Do you have any guidance on how you think we should have handled it?  If you have any further suggestions on how we can improve the content or formatting of the SAs please let me know.
