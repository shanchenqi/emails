I was under the impression that if the backend was off the plugin wouldn't work/expose the vuln, I could of course be wrong, if so I'll assign a CVE.  >  >> "NO Engage - Sensitive Data  >> Protection >>  >  > We debated a bit about this one and whether to make it an SA or > not.

Well the CVE inclusion decisions:  Pro assignment: Does exploitation of the issue provide the attacker with extra privileges or information, or cause a denial of service, that the attacker would not already have before they attempt to exploit the issue?  Anti-assignment: Is the issue site-specific? Is it only in an online service (software-as-a-service), on a specific web site, or only offered through hosting solutions that are under the full control of the vendor? Does the issue only affect a version that was never made generally available to the vendor's customers?  > If you have any further suggestions on how we can improve the > content or formatting of the SAs please let me know.
