I am not that sure about the defaults, because I changed them. However running a Munin without any plugins is pointless. It is like running a mail server that does not transport any mail. You don't even have to guess the name of a configured plugin, because those images are linked from the html. Finding a configured plugin is really no issue on any sane munin installation. Sane administrators may have to restricted access to munin to themselves as to not expose the monitoring results to the public though.
