Christos Zoulas merged the relevant ones of my FreeSec code changes into NetBSD, for NetBSD 6.  Thus, starting with NetBSD 6, its crypt(3) will have almost the same semantics for invalid two-character salts that recent PHP's crypt() and UFC-crypt in glibc do.  Other *BSDs are welcome to merge these changes, too.
