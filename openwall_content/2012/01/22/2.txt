So, use for this new one.   Summary:      - XSS in compose page, (traditional view), the contacts    popup window, and with certain IMAP mailbox names.  Fixed in    Horde IMP and apparently Webmail     (new) - XSS in email validation, related to the Form    library, only affecting Webmail  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
