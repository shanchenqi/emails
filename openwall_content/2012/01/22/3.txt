Anyone got a pointer to JĂźri's report?  I suppose it was somewhere on LKML, but I haven't found it yet.  I see how the checks against current->self_exec_id were insufficient for security, yet maybe the report contained something else as well?  > This changes it to do the permission checks at open time, and instead of > tracking the process, it tracks the VM at the time of the open.

I see it in the revised code, but I don't get it.  What does "the old VM" mean after an execve()?  The code stores the mm pointer in file->private_data, but is this stored pointer even valid after an execve()?  (The code blindly assumes so, only checking for non-NULL.)  Was this discussed (on LKML or elsewhere)?  >  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
