Should such device drivers > be considered vulnerable or not?  Thanks.  They should be considered buggy, yes, and as such, the kernel developers will fix any reported problems (or we should, if not, please let me know.)  But note, as these almost always fall under the "you have physical access" category, their security impact is generally considered low.  thanks,  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
