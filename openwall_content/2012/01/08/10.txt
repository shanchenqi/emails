As far as publicly known, it's likely that Stuxnet was originally spread via a security problem with USB.  Also, I'd doubt the "physical access" category. It may just require a bit of social engineering ("I have the file you requested on this usb stick").  Considering that I'd strongly disagree classifying such issues "low impact".  At least for pluggable devices, I'd consider such issues rather serious. It's another thing with PCI or other devices that require significant work to attach to a piece of hardware.    --  Hanno Bรถck		mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
