Are you saying you can cause arbitrary text output via XSL/XML mangling tricks? And combined with having a script that uses something like "<sax:output href="0wn3d.php" method="text">" you can put arbitrary text content into this file which could then result in the file being parsed? The problem is you'd have to write a script that does this, writes to a local file with a file ending in .php or .shtml or whatever, in which case it's pretty clear the script writer MEANT to do that. Again I'm still not clear on what/how a security boundary is being crossed. How does this elevate privileges or give you remote access that you wouldn't already if you can upload arbitrary PHP scripts?  --   -- Kurt Seifried / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
