If a security feature is less strong than advertised (or less strong than  its user may reasonably assume), then this is enough to qualify for CVE.  > Problem arises when a user doesn't check the account db [0] and blindly  > trust the results of key validation, possibly automatically mapping  > successfully validated keys to default users.

Since there are plausible scenarios in which the feature could be misused,  this also seems to qualify for a CVE.  > To be honest, issuing a CVE seems a bit overkilling to me.  CVE doesn't cover just the most serious vulnerabilities out there. While  the circumstances might be rare, and it's not as serious as other  problems, it's still "bad enough" that some consumers would care about it.  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
