Please assign a CVE number to those issues.  The issues are fixed in PostfixAdmin which I'll release today or  tomorrow.   For reference, here's the changelog with all details:    - fix SQL injection in pacrypt() (if $CONF[encrypt] == 'mysql_encrypt')   - fix SQL injection in backup.php - the dump was not mysql_escape()d,      therefore users could inject SQL (for example in the vacation message)     which will be executed when restoring the database dump.     WARNING: database dumps created with backup.php from or older might              contain malicious SQL. Double-check before using them!   - fix XSS with $_GET[domain] in templates/menu.php and edit-vacation   - fix XSS in some create-domain input fields   - fix XSS in create-alias and edit-alias error message   - fix XSS (by values stored in the database) in fetchmail list view,     list-domain and list-virtual   - create-domain: fix SQL injection (only exploitable by superadmins)   - add missing $LANG['pAdminDelete_admin_error']   - don't mark mailbox targets with recipient delimiter as "forward only"   - wrap hex2bin with function_exists() - PHP has it as native function  If you are interested in the exact code changes, run     svn diff -r https://postfixadmin.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/postfixadmin/branches/postfixadmin-2.3   Severity: that's a good question, please judge yourself ;-)  The most critical part is probably the SQL injection in pacrypt() because it is used in the login form, which means it's available to non-authentificated users. On the positive side, I'd guess the mysql_encrypt encryption method is used rarely.  The affected code in pacrypt() is ($pw was not escaped, $salt comes from the database (the first 2 characters of the current hashed password)):             $res=db_query("SELECT ENCRYPT('".$pw."','".$salt."');"); or when hashing a new password             $res=db_query("SELECT ENCRYPT('".$pw."');");  db_query() is a wrapper that uses (depending on the configured database) mysql_query, mysqli_query or pg_query.  The other issues are limited to authentificated users.   GruĂ  Christian Boltz --  >So, Helm aufsetz und auf Steine wart ... *werf* *Steine! Flache Steine! Runde Steine! Grosse Steine!
