From: Vincent Lefevre <vincent@...c17.net> To: Debian Bug Tracking System <submit@...s.debian.org> Subject: wicd writes sensitive information in log files (password,  passphrase...) Date: Sat, 17 Dec  Package: wicd Version: Severity: grave Tags: security Justification: user security hole  wicd writes sensitive information in log files (under /var/log/wicd), such as passwords and passphrases. Users in the adm group can have access to them, but also log files are meant to be sent in bug reports, and if the bug reporter doesn't pay attention, there is a huge risk to transmit such information.   === modified file 'wicd/configmanager.py' --- +++ @@ @@              ret = to_unicode(ret)              if default:                  if self.debug: -                    print ''.join(['found ', option, ' in configuration ', -                                   str(ret)]) +                    # mask out sensitive information +                    if option in ['apsk', 'password', 'identity', 'private_key', \ +                                  'private_key_passwd', 'key', 'passphrase']: +                        print ''.join(['found ', option, ' in configuration *****']) +                    else: +                        print ''.join(['found ', option, ' in configuration ', +                                       str(ret)])          else:              if default != "__None__":                  print 'did not find %s in configuration, setting default %s' % (option, str(default))   --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
