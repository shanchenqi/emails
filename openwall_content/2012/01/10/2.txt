Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE Request: CEDET/Emacs global-ede-mode file loading vulnerability  I'll assign this a CVE once I have determined the code base status (are these considered the same codebase, or have they forked enough to be considered separate code bases? Also I need to ensure this hasn't already been assigned a CVE. CC'ing relevant developers as well.   EMACS  Hiroshi Oota has found a security flaw in EDE (part of CEDET), a development tool included in Emacs.  EDE can store various information about a project, such as how to build the project, in a file named Project.ede in the project directory tree.  When the minor mode `global-ede-mode' is enabled, visiting a file causes Emacs to look for Project.ede in the file's directory or one of its parent directories. If Project.ede is present, Emacs automatically reads and evaluates the first Lisp expression in it.  This design exposes EDE users to the danger of loading malicious code from one file (Project.ede), simply by visiting another file in the same directory tree.

The bzr repos trunk and newtrunk were updated.
