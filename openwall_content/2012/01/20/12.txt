Please do not ask for a longer embargo.  In fact, embargoes shorter than 14 days are preferable."  Previously, the maximum was specified as 14 days unconditionally, but frankly this started to fail in practice for the day-of-week reason - so I've adjusted the policy as above (based on proposals from list members).  While at it, I've also added this clarification on the format of messages:  "Speaking of encryption, the supported message formats are: plain unencrypted messages, PGP/MIME (including with attachments), or inline PGP.  (In all of these cases, messages are distributed to list members (re-)encrypted to their own keys.)  However, manual PGP-encrypted attachments are not supported (so if you want to attach file(s) to your encrypted message, use PGP/MIME)."
