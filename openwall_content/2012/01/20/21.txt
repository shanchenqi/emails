In fact, embargoes shorter than 14 days are preferable."  > Why not just make it 10 business days  It wouldn't do the trick.  10 business days from a Wednesday gives us another Wednesday, which is good, but 10 business days from a Friday gives us another Friday (unless there are holidays).  > with a note to be kind with > respect to holidays (i.e. over the Xmas break for us North/South > Americans and Europeans).  That's tricky.  For example, in Russia the New Year holidays may last for 11 or 12 days (such as Dec 30 to Jan 10).  If we attempt to account for that along with the Christmas break, then 10 business days may turn into a month.  So I don't mind adding an informal note "to be kind with respect to holidays", but its exact meaning will vary and it should not affect the maximum embargo period of 14 to 19 days.  > Agreed for the message format.

I only know that Mutt works fine.  Thanks for your comments!
