Vulnerable versions: - GoLISMERO_last.zip (Nov 14, - (Nov 9, - All Git-revisions before  Reported to author: Fixed by me: Link to the commit:  I fixed this, because developer had lack of time. I am asking for CVE, because this software is used in backtrack where golismero is executed as root-user.  Should get ID as this was publicly announced I haven't read all the code yet so there might be other issues too. I am not the original developer, but helped a bit after I found this vulnerability.  - Henri Salo  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
