E.g. documenting a default usrname/password where it can be easily changed is reasonable. Documenting a default username/password that cannot be changed doesn't really help to the same degree.  In this case we have something that tells you not to use an unsafe option but isn't exceedingly noticeable or clear (if it came up every time you used that option there would be a stringer case for no CVE). I'm sitting on the fence for this one (I can see it going either way), wouldn't mind some more opinions from the smart people on this list.  --   -- Kurt Seifried / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
