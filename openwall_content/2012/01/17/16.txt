In this case, the product's security feature is not living up to its  advertised capability (by generating shorter passwords than expected) so,  even if it's not that severe an issue, it's probably still of some  importance to some people.  The availability of the software does not directly affect CVE inclusion;  if it could be available for people to install on their own systems, then  it can be covered by CVE.  Obviously this applies to any software that is  available for download from the web, whether open or closed source.  (I  say "does not directly affect CVE inclusion" because CVE cannot keep up  with every single product and every single vulnerability due to various  limitations - primarily the raw number of vulns that are released every  year - so, some products with limited "market share" might not make it  into CVE even though they would technically qualify.)  - Steve   On Tue, 17 Jan Yves-Alexis Perez wrote:  > Hi list, > > we were pointed at a bug in gpw (a password generator), which makes it > generate shorter password than required at a rate of ~20 over 1 million. > The bug is at > (so already public) and I'm wondering if that deserves a CVE: > > * gpw seems unmaintained (upstream and in Debian since around > * I'm not sure people even use it > * people using it interactively will notice the password has the wrong > size > > But as it may be used in a script, then it might still be a real issue. > > What do people think? > > Regards, > --  > Yves-Alexis >  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
