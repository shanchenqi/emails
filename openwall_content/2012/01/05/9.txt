This affects Torque and is fixed n Torque Torque was released on Nov 5, (http://www.adaptivecomputing.com/resources/downloads/torque/)  -------------------  Ideally then you'd also post a link to the source code change. Depending on the availability of an upstream advisory/etc. this isn't always necessary.  Important note: In future I will not be assigning CVE's for postings of just the Secunia URL, you need to include more information as mentioned above so that a) I can research and verify the issue and b) to reduce the chance of duplicates and c) assign the correct year.
