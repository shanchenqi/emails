This behavior seems to have been introduced in a recent commit[1] and i couldn't find a way to disable it.  All screen locking programs i tested (gnome-screensaver, kscreenlocker, slock, slimlock...), are basically rendered useless.  Not sure if this is a bug or a feature... :)   [1]:   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
