There now is a patch in addition to [4] that people seeking to fix the described issue may be interested in.  Dirk Meyer of FreeBSD brought my attention to a broken case with munpack that was shipped broken with the original 1.6 upstream tarball but may have been fixed by the removal of O_EXCL applied by earlier attempts to fix the insecure tempfile handling (as with FreeBSD).  So with O_EXCL back in (or still in place), patch [5] can be used to repair munpack.
