Later the applied upstream patch was found to be incomplete. The CVE identifier of has been assigned to this incomplete fix with the issue description as follows:  A cross site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way Zope2 and Zope3 performed error messages sanitization. If a remote attacker could trick a user, who was logged into Zope2, into visiting a specially-crafted URL, it would lead to arbitrary web script execution in the context of user's Zope2 session. If a remote attacker could trick a user, who was logged into Zope3, into examining error entries for particular Zope3 instance, it would lead to arbitrary web script execution in the context of user's Zope3 session.
