But how about USB devices that an attacker could plug into a victim's computer?  For example, an attacker may craft a USB device with a long product name to cause a buffer overflow   Here is another possible bug in the USB audio format parser I tried to report upstream.   I am wondering where to draw the line.  Should such device drivers be considered vulnerable or not?  Thanks.  - xi  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
