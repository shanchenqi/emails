I attached the program. So now I'm wondering about two issues. I just tested this with dropbear  and I am still able to DoS it just fine even though at least  claims that this has been fixed in  Dropbear SSH Server The other thing is that I'm wondering how to  properly handle this issue with openssh?  This certainly is no vulnerability  that is straight-forward to fix and it might even be that openssh would argue  that this is a problem.  This is certainly a very easy DoS and given that this definitely  affects Debian configurations and also the default configuration, I feel  uncomfortable to further ignore this problem.  I think its time to discuss this and work on a fix. Solar Designer is  proposing something along the lines of per-source limits which seems like a  reasonable solution to me (I guess he will send more information on this). What do you (especially the people shipping openssh) think about this?
