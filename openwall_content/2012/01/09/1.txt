If you are using cvss2, the flaw itself should have a low impact, and how it will affect your environment may have a higher impact. See http://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-guide.html#i2.3.  It's hard to give a single rating that can be applied to all scenarios because obviously in some environments, this is not an issue, while in other cases like public Internet kiosks, it can be a big headache.
