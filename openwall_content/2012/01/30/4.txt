Ok I'm not clear on what is going on here, is there a link to the bug entry regarding this issue, or can someone clarify it?  1) are there default accounts shipped with the product that get activated automatically during install? (it sounds like yes?)  2) can someone remotely/locally access these accounts? what are the credentials for these accounts ("invalid keys"?), can an attacker access them?  3) what is the privilege level of the accounts?    --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
