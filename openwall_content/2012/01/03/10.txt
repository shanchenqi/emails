The attached Perl script simulates a worst-case scenario for an algorithm implementing this.  Specifically, with slots and allocations starting at 10 slots per source (and reducing all the way to 1 per source as we're about to run out of free slots), we're able to accept connections from at least different source addresses. With slots, but starting at 50 slots per source, we're able to accept connections from at least 88 different source addresses.  $ ./persource.pl | wc -l $ for n in do ./persource.pl | fgrep -cx $n; done 10 12 12 14 17 20 24 34 49  Alexander  View attachment "persource.pl" of type "text/plain" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
