Does it still work?  I was not able to reproduce that.  I built Dropbear generated an RSA host key with "./dropbearkey -t rsa -f dropbear_rsa_host_key" and started the service with "./dropbear -r dropbear_rsa_host_key -p  Then I ran your DoS program with 10" on the command-line.  At first, it detected that Dropbear would only allow 5 connections from the source address (indeed, Dropbear's MAX_UNAUTH_PER_IP defaults to 5), and I was no longer able to get the SSH version banner with "nc -v 0 (the connection would be closed immediately).  However, after a while I started being able to connect with "nc" again, and Dropbear's log records only showed the DoS program making 4 connections at a time, not 5 - I don't know why.  So I hacked the program to make 6 connections at a time instead (changed get_max_startups() to just "return 6;").  Then the DoS for connections from became reliable, so I was able to reasonably test connections from other source IP addresses, which I did.  "nc -s -v 0 worked flawlessly (multiple times with no issue), reporting  Thus, the per-source limit appeared to work as it should have.  Where's the problem?  (Of course, with the defaults of MAX_UNAUTH_CLIENTS 30 and MAX_UNAUTH_PER_IP 5 it'd only take abusive connections from 6 IP addresses to DoS the service, but that's expected.)
