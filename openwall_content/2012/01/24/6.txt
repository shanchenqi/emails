One should note that even OSVDB has a license, which will limit the usage of the data: http://osvdb.org/license and from my own experience I can say that this is definitely not always a good thing and might create new aspects for words open and free. For NDA reasons I can't say the case where this was a problem, but you can use your imagination.  - Henri Salo  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
