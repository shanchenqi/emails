Despite public perception, CVE is *not* a vulnerability database (although  the National Vulnerability Database [NVD], which extends CVE, *is*).  For  CVE, our primary role has always been to provide standard vulnerability  identifiers that everybody can use, so our analysis is focused on that  particular task, which keeps us busy enough :-)  Tracking  disclosure-related information is outside the scope of our project (and  finding this information can take more time than you'd expect).  We use an  imprecise notion of disclosure date so we can determine which year to  place in the CVE-YYYY-nnnn identifier, but that's it.  I completely agree that tracking this kind of information is important,  and I've personally wanted to see disclosure-related stats for years.  I  specifically mentioned OSVDB because they are trying to track this  information at a greater level of detail than any other effort I know of.  And, by virtue of being an *open source* vulnerability database, others  can contribute to it.  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
