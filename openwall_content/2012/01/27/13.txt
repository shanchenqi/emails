Authenticated to localhost debug1: channel 0: new [client-session] debug1: Requesting no-more-sessions@...nssh.com debug1: Entering interactive session. debug1: Sending environment. debug1: Sending env LANG = en_US.UTF-8 Environment: [snip] =========  As we can see we get the debug information BEFORE authentication is finished.  So this issue was then addressed in 5.4:   - (dtucker) OpenBSD CVS Sync    - dtucker@....openbsd.org      [auth-rhosts.c monitor.c monitor_wrap.c session.c auth-options.c sshd.c]      Hold authentication debug messages until after successful authentication.      Fixes an info leak of environment variables specified in authorized_keys,      reported by Jacob Appelbaum.  ok djm@   which contains the following line:  -	auth_debug_reset();  So now more information is sent in the debug message (post-authentication) which created this problem:  ========= debug1: Offering RSA public key: /home/test-ssh2/.ssh/id_rsa debug1: Server accepts key: pkalg ssh-rsa blen debug1: read PEM private key done: type RSA debug1: Authentication succeeded (publickey). Authenticated to localhost debug1: channel 0: new [client-session] debug1: Requesting no-more-sessions@...nssh.com debug1: Entering interactive session. debug1: Remote: Forced command: echo 1 debug1: Remote: Forced command: echo 2 debug1: Remote: Forced command: echo 3 debug1: Remote: Forced command: echo 1 debug1: Remote: Forced command: echo 2 debug1: Remote: Forced command: echo 3 debug1: Sending environment. debug1: Sending env LANG = en_US.UTF-8 Environment:   LANG=en_US.UTF-8 [stuff] =========  Then in version the certificate handling code was reworked and  something fixed this problem, we haven't tracked it down exactly (it  may be related to cert_forced_command, auth_cert_options and  parse_option_list).  TL;DR anyone shipping OpenSSH portable 5.4 and 5.5 is vulnerable and needs to fix this.  This may also affect OpenSSH (non portable) which I'll test when I get home.  --   -- Kurt Seifried / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
