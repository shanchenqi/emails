I forgot to mention a small, but important detail: The credits ;-)  Credits go to      Filippo Cavallarin <filippo.cavallarin [at] codseq [dot] it>  for finding most of the vulnerabilities and notifying us.  The only exception is      - create-domain: fix SQL injection (only exploitable by superadmins)  which was found by Matthias Bethke <msbethke [at] sourceforge [dot] net>  Please add the credits to the CVEs.
