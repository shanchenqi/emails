Christey" <coley@...-smtp.mitre.org> To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: Re: CVE id assignment dates   Alexander,  This misconception is, unfortunately, all too common.  I will look into  ways of changing it on the CVE web site.  The Assigned date, strictly defined, is the date on which the specific CVE  *number* was first created and "committed" to the CVE database.  There is  no guaranteed relationship between the public disclosure date and the  Assigned date.  When a CNA receives a pool of numbers, the Assigned date is when that pool  was created by MITRE.  A CNA pool is just a list of CVE numbers that  aren't even associated with a specific vulnerability.  When MITRE reserves a CVE candidate for an independent, non-CNA party, the  "Assigned" date reflects the day that we reserved the candidate - which is  sometimes before the issue is published, and sometimes even before the  vendor is notified.  In other cases, MITRE independently assigns new CVEs for already-disclosed  vulnerabilities, and the Assigned date reflects when we created those  CVEs.  In this case, the Assigned date can be AFTER the original  disclosure date.  We do not publish any dates related to disclosure, patch, or vendor  notification; interested parties can consult other databases that  explicitly track this information, such as OSVDB.  - Steve   On Mon, 23 Jan Solar Designer wrote:  > Hi, > > It appears that many people are confused by and concerned about the > "Assigned" dates on CVE ids, not being aware that these dates often (or > even all the time?) merely reflect the assignment of a CVE id pool to a > CNA, normally before the actual vulnerabilities are discovered. > > For example, shows "Assigned - so someone > wrongly thought that this meant that kernel developers or whoever sat on > this bug for 1.5 months. > > I think cve.mitre.org web pages need to provide an explanation right > next to these dates or not show the dates. > > Alexander >  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
