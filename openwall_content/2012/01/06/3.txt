In future I can add files affected and correct parameters to these requests for clarity.

Descripcion.  ==========  WordPress 0.7 permite la ejecucion remota de comandos en ./wp-links/links.all.php. Un atacante puede inyectar una url en $abspath y obtener ejecucion remota de comandos con los privilegios del servidor web (habitualmente nobody).  WordPress 0.7 allows remote execution of commands. / Wp-links / links.all.php. An attacker can  inject a url in $ abspath and get remote execution of commands with the privileges of the server  web (usually nobody).  is about links.all.php abspath variable RFI ==========   WordPress 0.7 (codigo de b2 cafelog) permite inyeccion sql en ./blog.header.php. $posts no se convierte a entero, por lo que podemos inyectar sql en esta variable. En MySQL 4.x podemos utilizar UNION y subselects para obtener privilegios.     WordPress 0.7 (b2 cafelog code) allows SQL injection. / Blog.header.php. $ posts not  converted to an integer, so we can inject sql in this variable. In MySQL 4.x can use  UNION and subselects to obtain privileges. is about blog.header.php posts variable SQL injection   ==========  Since these are very old I think we can get away with switching them and not re-assigning. --   -- Kurt Seifried / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
