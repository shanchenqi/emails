Descriptions are switched.  is about blog.header.php posts variable SQL injection is about links.all.php abspath variable RFI  OSVDB already added these to the advisories, but that can be easily fixed. In future I can add files affected and correct parameters to these requests for clarity. Sorry for the confusion, but could you tell me which CVE should be used for which vulnerability?  - Henri Salo  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
