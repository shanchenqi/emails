They jumped from 1.7 to and support for 1.7.x is following:  "Please note that version 1.7 will reach end of life on 24 February  EOL for 1.7.x means also 1.6.x, which both are still heavily uesd.  http://www.joomla.org/download.html  Joomla is part of oCERT "The oCERT team is a volunteer-based force of well-known security professionals from major Open Source projects, vendors and the security community."  Basicly the end of support for 1.7.x and 1.6.x means that if you go to support-forum and ask something you will be asked for your software version number and if it isn't they will tell you to upgrade, before you will get more help.  - Henri Salo  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
