I do not know why I did not see this in allitems.txt.gz. Can't find other CVEs with that URL. There seems to be three issues. I am refering to  "Version also addresses three security issues discovered by WordPress core developers Jon Cave and Peter Westwood, of our security team. The first hardens CSRF prevention in the media uploader. The second avoids a PHP crash in certain environments when handling devilishly devised links in comments, and the third addresses an XSS flaw."  ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Phase: Assigned Category:  Reference: Reference:  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in wp-comments-post.php in WordPress 3.3.x before when Internet Explorer is used, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the query string in a POST operation that is not properly handled by the "Duplicate comment detected" feature.
