I guess my question/concern would be is who does the research to verify all this, and what if it varies by version (i.e. it is 6 separate issues in an older version but the newer version combined some code into a common library for example so it's only a single issue, but with multiple avenues of attack/etc.). In other words a lot of potential work.  --   -- Kurt Seifried / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
