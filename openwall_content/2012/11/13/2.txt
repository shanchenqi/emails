ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  domain_pirq_to_emuirq() uses the guest provided pirq value before range checking it, and physdev_unmap_pirq uses domain_pirq_to_emuirq without checking the pirq value either.  Invalid pirq values can cause Xen to read out of array bounds, usually resulting in a fatal page fault.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest administrator can cause Xen to crash.  If the out of array bounds access does not crash, the arbitrary value read will be ignored due to later error checking, so there is no privilege escalation and no exploitable information leak.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Only Xen version 4.1 is vulnerable.  Other released versions, and xen-unstable, are not vulnerable.  The vulnerability is only exposed to HVM guests.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only PV guests, or ensuring that HVM guests only use trusted kernels, will avoid this vulnerability.  RESOLUTION ==========  The attached patch resolves this issue.  $ xsa21.patch  xsa21.patch $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =yPnD -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment "xsa21.patch" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
