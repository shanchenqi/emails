ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  A guest which sets a VCPU with an inappropriate deadline can cause an infinite loop in Xen, blocking the affected physical CPU indefinitely.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest administrator can trigger the bug.  If the Xen watchdog is enabled, the whole system will crash.  Otherwise the guest can cause the system to become completely unresponsive.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All versions of Xen from at least 3.4 onwards are vulnerable, to every kind of guest.  Systems with only trusted guest kernels are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  There is no mitigation available other than to use a trusted guest kernel.  RESOLUTION ==========  The attached patch resolves this issue.  The same patch is applicable to all affected versions.  $ xsa20.patch  xsa20.patch $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =nj9Z -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment "xsa20.patch" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
