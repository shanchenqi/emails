ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The Xen PV domain builder contained no validation of the size of the supplied kernel or ramdisk either before or after decompression. This could cause the toolstack to consume all available RAM in the domain running the domain builder.   Additionally, under similar circumstances pygrub consume excessive amount of memory under similar circumstances to the above.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest administrator who can supply a kernel or ramdisk can exhaust memory in domain 0 leading to a denial of service attack.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All versions of Xen are vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only trusted kernels and ramdisks will avoid these vulnerabilities.  Using pvgrub also avoids these vulnerabilities since the builder will run in guest context. (nb: use of pygrub *is* vulnerable).  Running only HVM guests will avoid these vulnerabilities.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves these issues.  The pygrub problem was fixed in xen-unstable (and the fix inherited by Xen 4.2.x) in revision but not called out as a security problem.  This fix is also included, where necessary, in the patches below.  xsa25-unstable.patch        Xen unstable             Xen 4.2.x             Xen 4.1.x  $ xsa25*.patch    xsa25-unstable.patch  Note that these patches impose a new size limit of 1Gby on both the compressed and uncompressed sizes of ramdisks.  On some systems it may be desirable to relax these limits and risk virtual address or memory exhaustion in the toolstack.  This can be achieved by setting XC_DOM_DECOMPRESS_MAX to the desired limit (in bytes). This can be done by building with "APPEND_CFLAGS=-DXC_DOM_DECOMPRESS_MAX=<limit>" or by editing tools/libxc/xc_dom.h directly.  NOTE REGARDING LACK OF EMBARGO ==============================  These issues have already been discussed in public in various places, including and  This advisory is therefore not subject to an embargo. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =Pfj+ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment "xsa25-unstable.patch" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
