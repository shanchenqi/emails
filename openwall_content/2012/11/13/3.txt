ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The HVMOP_pagetable_dying hypercall does not correctly check the caller's pagetable state, leading to a hypervisor crash.  IMPACT ======  An HVM guest running on shadow pagetables (that is, not HAP) can cause the hypervisor to crash.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen versions from 4.0 onwards are vulnerable, except that:  - systems that run only PV guests are not vulnerable  - systems that run all HVM guests using HAP (which is the default on    hardware that supports it) are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  This issue can be avoided by running only PV guests or by running all HVM guests using hardware-assisited paging (HAP, also called NPT, RVI and EPT).  Xen will run guests using HAP by default on hardware that supports it, unless it is disbled by putting 'hap=0' either on the xen hypervisor command-line or in the VM's configuration.  You can check whether a particular machine supports HAP by looking at xen's boot messages.  On Xen 4.1, 4.2 and unstable, Xen will print "HVM: Hardware Assisted Paging (HAP) detected" during boot; on xen 4.0 the message is "HVM: Hardware Assisted Paging detected".  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.          Xen 4.0.x, 4.1.x    Xen 4.2.x, xen-unstable  $ xsa23*.patch   $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =stq6 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
