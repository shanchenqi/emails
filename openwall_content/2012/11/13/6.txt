ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  When set_p2m_entry fails, Xen's internal data structures (the p2m and m2p tables) can get out of sync.  This failure can be triggered by unusual guest behaviour exhausting the memory reserved for the p2m table.  If it happens, subsequent guest-invoked memory operations can cause Xen to fail an assertion and crash.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest administrator might be able to cause Xen to crash.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All versions of Xen since at least 3.4 are vulnerable.  The vulnerability is only exposed to HVM guests.  MITIGATION ==========  There is no mitigation available other than to use a trusted guest kernel.  RESOLUTION ==========  The attached patch resolves this issue.  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.
