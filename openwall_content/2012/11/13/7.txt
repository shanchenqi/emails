In certain circumstances when removing the route the ospf6d daemon terminated with assertion failure when trying to determine / find, which route to remove. An OSPF6 router could use this flaw to cause ospf6d on an adjacent router to abort.  References: [1] [2]  Upstream bug report: [3]  Could you allocate a CVE id for this?
