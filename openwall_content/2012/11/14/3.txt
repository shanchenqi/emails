If you load the root certificate  store and examine SSL_get_verify_result, that should be sufficient.  You  can even look at the peer certificate and continue anyway if the user  has overridden the certificate validity.  So far, I haven't found a good  reason to use a verify callback at all.  You need it to implement a  custom PKIX validation policy, but that should be pretty rare.  (I still  have to check older OpenSSL versions, though, perhaps there, the  behavior was different.)  Anyway, if application developers set a verification callback, it is  their responsibility to implement it correctly.  Therefore, I don't  think this is an OpenSSL issue.  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
