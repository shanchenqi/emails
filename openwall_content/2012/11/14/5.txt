The versions of openvas-manager package, as shipped with Fedora release of 16 and release of 17 is based on upstream version yet. From what I have looked and can tell from upstream advisory and patch (for 3.0.X version): [1] [2]  the does not seem to be applicable to OpenVAS-4 / openvas-manager version yet: [3]  But prior definitely classifying Fedora 16 and Fedora 17 openvas-manager package versions as not vulnerable to this issue, I would like to hear opinion / confirmation from someone more familiar with OpenVAS code.  So could you confirm the wouldn't affect OpenVAS-4 2.0.X version (yet)?  Thank you && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team  ----- Original Message ----- Doh, a document gets proof read by multiple people and yet it contains a  mistake.  In the Current Status section of the advisory, the date is  incorrect.  A corrected advisory is attached.
