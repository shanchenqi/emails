If you deem it safer we can bump to current 3.0.x version - I know it is usually nono, but there should be no casualties, since I sincerely doubt there are _ANY_ openvas users on Fedora distribution as half of the openvas suite packages is still under review.   Mainly the openvas suite doesn't work on current Fedora due to incompatibility between openvas network stack (openvas-libraries) and the gnutls library we have in Fedora.
