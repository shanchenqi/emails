I am not surprised that our list is behind. I did mention there would be a 3 month delay in new postings back when I was trying to get MontaVista back on the closed list which seemed acceptable at the time. This delay seems excessive. I will ping my management again.  If you feel that MV should be dropped from the list-distros list, then so be it.  I do realize this list is maintained by volunteers and today's rules are based on previous emails (kinda hard me to follow).  I do hope the requirements listed at  http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros  will be update with "How to maintain membership" and "How to ack/nack additional team members memberships".
