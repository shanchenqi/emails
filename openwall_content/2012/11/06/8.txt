There were fixes released btw ...  (If we are talking about the same problem.)  SUSE at least did release fixes for the terminal character injection, by opening a new session.  is this whole issue I think.)   Ludwig Nussel tried to also use pseudo tty, but this gets kind of messy soon, especially if you start with the signal handling required (ctrl-z and ctrl-c over su are supposed to work...).  Fun enough, after release one of our customers reported to actually use code like:  	su nobody -c "echo Test >/dev/tty"   Ciao, Marcus  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
