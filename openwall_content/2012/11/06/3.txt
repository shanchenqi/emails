Nice.  I was just wondering why the SIGSTOP signal is used here? Sending a string starting with "exit;" to close the child process also does the trick, no?  When [1] was posted on the oss list, I wrote this little PoC [2] to hijacked interactive bash shell opened with "su - <user>".  > I would like to propose following "fix" for this problem: Modification > of man-page of su making this a known problem or feature, not a bug.  Changing the man page is a good idea.  Administrators (good ones) should never have to open users's interactive shells.  I mean, beside being a security problem, it's kind of invasion of privacy. ;)    [1]   [2] http://vladz.devzero.fr/svn/codes/bash/dontsu.sh  vladz.
