Signed as GPG/PGP signed.  When you were subscribed to the list, you had provided your GPG key (id).  If you sign your reply with that key, list administrator can verify that it is really form current list member, vouching for another person representing the same distro or organization.  A good example of similar past communication is this thread:  As you can see there, a request may come from a person that is involved with a distribution, but is not expected to be a list member as a security representative of the distribution.  It's really this kind of feedback that can help list administrator here, and signing makes it verifiable.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
