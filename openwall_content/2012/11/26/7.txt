It was reported that Tor suffered from a denial of service vulnerability due to an error when handling SENDME cells.  This could be exploited to cause excessive consumption of memory resources within an entry node.  This is fixed in upstream version  References:   Thanks.  --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
