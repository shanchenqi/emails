A token expiration date can be circumvented by creating a new token before the old one has expired. An authenticated and authorized user could potentially leverage this vulnerability to extend his access beyond the account owner expectations. Note: this vulnerability was fixed in the past but was reintroduced in Folsom when code was refactored to support PKI tokens.  Grizzly (development branch) fix:  Folsom fix (included in upcoming Keystone stable update):  References:  - --  Thierry Carrez (ttx) OpenStack Vulnerability Management Team -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with undefined - http://www.enigmail.net/  =CZnJ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
