In either case, after configuring a calendar and trying to access it, the full url is displayed in the status tray when trying to poll the calendar, something like:  Fetching 'https://user:password@...ver.example.com/location/of/my/Calendar'...  Thus, use of the vCalendar plugin really isn't suitable or secure for such configurations!  In the scenarios above, the former is more of a concern but neither is one you'd necessarily want to expose to prying eyes.  Even a google calendar "private url", for example, is visible it its entirety within the status tray. =============   Basically for all password entry fields we usually **** them out by default. As well AFAIK pretty much all applications that store passwords in plain text don't display them by default when you open up the password management screen (e.g. web browsers like Firefox). So in general we have a well established trend of hiding plain text passwords and not displaying them unless the users takes a specific action to display them (e.g. "show hidden password").
