Would that get the same sort of CVE ID?  CVE assignment at MITRE attempts to distinguish between "disclosures" and "rumors" although admittedly this is not successful. In the specific case you mentioned, if there's no maintainer relationship between "I" and "product X" and no other available context, then no CVE is assigned.  More generally, there are various cases in which exactly the same statement would have a different CVE assignment decision depending on whether the statement came from a vendor or other software maintainer. This has been mentioned here before; for example, see     - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJQlBRTAAoJEGvefgSNfHMdKAwH/icGoCMaheqgi4cQG4XsChlb =3WP8 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
