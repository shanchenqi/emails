When TIFFScanlineSize encountered an integer-overflow and returned zero, this value was not checked. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted PPM image format file, that when processed by ppm2tiff would lead to ppm2tiff executable crash or, potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the ppm2tiff binary.
