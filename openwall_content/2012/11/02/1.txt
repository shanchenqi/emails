I am not sure I am allowed to forward the quoted tdf-security mail that lists the LibreOffice commits.  But it has in its mailheader: From:     Caolรกn McNamara <caolanm@...hat.com> perhaps he can share the details (and I wonder why this caught redhat by surprise then);  (The whole OpenOffice/LibreOffice security issue handling is not really good ... long embargoes that get extended wildly even though fixes are in public GIT already, etc )  Ciao, Marcus  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
