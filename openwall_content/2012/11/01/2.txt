Debian released an advisory for OOo and I have no record of this CVE anywhere.  It looks as though it went public yesterday, and was fixed in upstream but it's not noted on the LibreOffice web site at all.  Does anyone have any further details on these issues?  I just filed a bug in our bugzilla with the following description/references which are all I've been able to find so far.  I'm not sure on the commit referenced as [4] below; that was the first one that caught my eye, but I think it might be a red herring as it doesn't seem to be relevant to any of the file types that are noted as affected.  Any further information anyone has would be sincerely appreciated.     It was reported [1] that LibreOffice suffered from multiple NULL pointer dereference flaws in at least version and possibly earlier. These flaws are reported to be corrected in [2], however I am unable to find a specific reference for this CVE on the LibreOffice site.  Debian has released an advisory for OpenOffice.org [3] so it presumably affected as well.  These flaws affect ODT files, ODG files, PPT files (when handling the PolyPolygon record within an embedded .wmf file), and XLS files.  Checking the LibreOffice git, I see two commits that may be relevant [4],[5].  However there are a lot of commits to go through between now and the time that High-Tech Bridge indicates they reported the flaws upstream (July 26th,  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]  --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
