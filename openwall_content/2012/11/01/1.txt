Please respond to the comments in this email, as it supercedes Kurt's  email from October 7.

Your answer to this question will help determine whether we have one CVE  or two.   >> | - Hotblocks - >> Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and Denial of Service (DoS) > > This is a multiple CVE issue?  Kurt - we investigated the advisory and it's pretty clear that the two are  distinct, so we assigned the following CVEs (Drupal people, please take  note):  - DoS (infinite loop with self-referencing block) - XSS   >> Multiple Vulnerabilities: | >> - Jstool - Access Bypass >> | - Jstool - >> Arbitrary code inclusion > > The description/vulns don't seem to match up on this one.

Drupal team - if these both have the same root cause, such as a directory  traversal issue, then they would receive one CVE since they are the same  type of issue - even if there are different impacts.  Otherwise, two CVEs  might be needed.  >> | - Taxonomy >> Image - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) & Arbitrary PHP code execution > So this is the same root issue, not filtering file uploads allowing an > attacker to upload arbitrary stuff (including PHP code), the outcome > of which could be PHP code execution, or XSS (or other things I > suppose like DoS, CSRF, etc.)?  This is the same basic issue as the last one.  If there's one root cause  in which file uploads aren't prevented when they should, then they might  receive only one CVE.  (Basically, if a user X is intentionally allowed to do action Y, but a  vulnerability allows somebody to become X - then we don't assign a  separate CVE ID for Y.)
