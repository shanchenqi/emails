I can't even find proof you work for Montavista (other than the email address) and I can't find any mention of a person called "Premchand Koneru" doing security work in the past.  I did manage to find a CVE page of sorts:  http://www.mvista.com/cve_vulnerabilities.php  For you appear to have fixed one Linux security flaw out of the 7 listed (the rest are OpenSSL/OpenSSH), so I'm not really sure why you would need access to distros@ if you aren't fixing Linux related security issues any ways?  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =iMG8 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
