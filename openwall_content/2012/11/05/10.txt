If a customer "owns" the systems or networks on which the software is installed, and/or is the entity who MUST take action to fix the issue, then it qualifies for a CVE.  If the fix for the issue is entirely in the hands of the vendor without any involvement by the consumer at all, then it does not get a CVE.  So, XSS on a custom web site, or a financial web site that exposes credentials, or a "typical" cloud-based offering, would generally not get a CVE.  (Note that this is a gap in the industry, as vulnerability databases in general don't cover "site-specific" or service-oriented issues.)  Based on the security-announcement-swf-vulnerability-in-yui-2 post, this requires users of YUI 2 to take certain actions for "Any project that hosts YUI 2 SWF files ...  on its own servers."  So, this qualifies for a CVE.  - Steve    -----Original Message----- From: Kurt Seifried [mailto:kseifried@...hat.com]  Sent: Monday, November 05, PM To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Cc: Reed Loden; Christey, Steven M.; security@...library.com Subject: Re: [oss-security] YUI 2.x security issue regarding embedded SWF files -- or, How Not To Handle A Security Disclosure  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1  On PM, Kurt Seifried wrote: > On PM, Reed Loden wrote: >> I haven't seen this posted at all, but it seems there's some  >> (major?) security issue regarding the SWF files embedded in YUI >> 2.
