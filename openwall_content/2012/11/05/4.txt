I believe this is the commit  I believe it is the case that XSS is one example of how to exploit the issue but that Local File Inclusion is the fundamental problem. The local file inclusion is just into a CSS context so it's not a way, for example, to execute arbitrary PHP. However it could be used to read any file on the server and display the contents inside of CSS (if Drupal's css aggregation feature is enabled). So, someone could use this to read the database credentials, for example. That might still not be enough to compromise the server depending on mysql access settings, firewalls etc.  > Your answer to this question will help determine whether we have one CVE or > two. > > >>> | - Hotblocks - >>> Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and Denial of Service (DoS) >> >> >> This is a multiple CVE issue? > > > Kurt - we investigated the advisory and it's pretty clear that the two are > distinct, so we assigned the following CVEs (Drupal people, please take > note): > > - DoS (infinite loop with self-referencing block) > - XSS  Advisory updated with these numbers  > >>> Multiple Vulnerabilities: | >>> - Jstool - Access Bypass >>> | - Jstool - >>> Arbitrary code inclusion >> >> >> The description/vulns don't seem to match up on this one.

Attached is the patch the maintainer provided for this issue - I'm not immediately sure which commit in git corresponds to this.  I believe there are distinct issues here: * The ability to read/write to arbitrary files * The ability to identify and read all Javascript files of the site - this is somewhat by design of Javascript, but the team member working on this issue felt that having direct access to read all files in one place would be useful to an attacker enough that it deserved mention. For example: It could be helpful to an attacker to see the source code of the Javascript for Ajax features that are admin only.   > Drupal team - if these both have the same root cause, such as a directory > traversal issue, then they would receive one CVE since they are the same > type of issue - even if there are different impacts.

Yes, this is fundamentally an "upload arbitrary stuff" issue.  > Thanks, > Steve  Thank you for your attention to detail!  :)  Regards, Greg  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
