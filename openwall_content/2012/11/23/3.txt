Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org>, security@...de.org Subject: CVE Request -- kronolith: Two sets && of XSS flaws  Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,    Horde upstream has recently released version of Kronolith, the Horde calendar application, correcting one set of XSS flaws:  [1]  [2]  more exactly: * Set #1: [mms] SECURITY: Fix XSS vulnerabilities in the portal blocks.   Upstream patch:   References: [1], [2] plus [3]  Also previously (in version yet another set of XSS flaws got corrected): * Set #2: [jan] SECURITY: Fix XSS vulnerabilities in tasks view and search view (Bug     Upstream ticket: [4]   Upstream patch:  [5]   References: [1], [2], [4], [5]   Note: There isn't a Red Hat Bugzilla entry, since the kronolith 2.x         version based versions shipped, within Fedora / Fedora EPEL weren't         vulnerable to this problem yet.  Look at MITRE CVE database for kronolith: [6] http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=kronolith  suggests the last security flaws, a CVE ids has been assigned to, were the following two: * --------  [jan] SECURITY: Fix privilege escalation in Horde API. => [cjh] SECURITY: Fix missing ownership validation on share changes =>  so both of sets of the XSS issues (Set #1, Set #2) should still be lacking (two) CVE identifiers.  Could you allocate them?
