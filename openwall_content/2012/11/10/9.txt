A valid backend login is required to exploit this | vulnerability. |  | Solution: Update to the TYPO3 version or that fix | the problem described! | | Credits: Credits go to Thomas Worm who discovered and reported the | issue.  (Probably needs two CVEs, one for SQL injection, one for cross-site scripting.)  | Vulnerable subcomponent: TYPO3 Backend History Module | Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure  | Problem Description: Due to a missing access check, regular editors | could see the history view of arbitrary records, only by forging a | proper URL for the History Module. A valid backend login is required | to exploit this vulnerability. | | Solution: Update to the TYPO3 version or that | fix the problem described! | | Credits: Credits go to Core Team Member Oliver Hader who discovered | and fixed the issue.  And:  | Vulnerable subcomponent: TYPO3 Backend API | Vulnerability Type: Cross-Site Scripting  | Problem Description: Failing to properly HTML-encode user input the | tree render API (TCA-Tree) is susceptible to Cross-Site | Scripting. TYPO3 Versions below 6.0 does not make us of this API, | thus is not exploitable, if no third party extension is installed | which uses this API. A valid backend login is required to exploit | this vulnerability. | | Solution: Update to the TYPO3 version or that | fix the problem described! | | Credits: Credits go to Johannes Feustel who discovered and reported | the issue.  (The version range appears to be different from the cross-site scripting above.)  | Vulnerable subcomponent: TYPO3 Backend API | Vulnerability Type: Cross-Site Scripting  | Problem Description: Failing to properly encode user input, the | function menu API is susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting. A valid | backend login is required to exploit this vulnerability. | | Solution: Update to the TYPO3 version or that | fix the problem described! | | Credits: Credits go to Richard Brain who discovered and reported the | issue.  (This can perhaps be merged with the first cross-site scripting CVE.)
