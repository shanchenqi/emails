Looks roundup has been released   http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/r/roundup/  but there doesn't seem to be CVE identifiers for these:   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=roundup  yet.  Thank you && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team  ----- Original Message ----- Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,    Roundup upstream has released new upstream version, correcting multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws (and couple of other security related issues): [1] http://pypi.python.org/pypi/roundup [2]  More from [1] (plus relevant tickets inlined too, where possible to find out): --------------------------------------------------------- [A] * Fix password history display for anydbm backend, thanks to Ralf Hemmecke for reporting. (Ralf) [3]  [B] * Fix XSS vulnerability when username contains HTML code, thanks to Thomas Arendsen Hein for reporting and patch. (Ralf) [4]  [C] * Fix XSS vulnerability in @action parameter, thanks to "om" for reporting. (Ralf) [5]  [D] * Fix wrong execute permissions on some files, thanks to Cheer Xiao for the patch. (Ralf)  [E] * Fix another XSS with the "otk" parameter, thanks to Jesse Ruderman for reporting. (Ralf)  [F] * Mark cookies HttpOnly and -- if https is used -- secure. Fixes but is untested if this really works in browsers. Thanks to Joseph Myers for reporting. (Ralf) [6]  [G] * Fix another XSS with the ok- and error message, see We solve this differently from the proposals in the bug-report by not allowing any html-tags in ok/error messages anymore. Thanks to David Benjamin for the bug-report and to Ezio Melotti for several proposed fixes. (Ralf) [7]  Cc-ed Ralf Schlatterbeck on this post too to clarify, if issues [A] and [D] would also have security implications / IOW if those would be security flaws too. Ralf please clarify. Thank you, Jan.  Could you allocate CVE ids for these (once clarified)?
