So basically IPv6 overlapping fragments are quite dangerous and can potentially be used to bypass firewalls/IDS/NIDS/etc.  Also I'm guessing there are a lot of "embedded" (not sure what term to use when network devices now have full computers in them, e.g. photocopiers) IPv6 stacks that will not handle overlapping fragments (crash, memory overwrite, who knows) and cannot be upgraded by users (since the devices are not supported/not supported properly by the makers).  So in a nutshell by not implementing we allow all manner of poorly defined and probably unwanted behaviours to take place, additionally we may end up passing nasty traffic to back end systems that cannot handle it well (and are expecting the front end machines to sanitize the traffic).  So to this end I am assigning (been saving it, it's easy to remember =) for "failure to implement properly, allowing overlapping fragmented IPv6 packets to be processed or passed to other systems resulting in all sorts of potential unknown badness with unknown consequences". It looks like more than just Linux is affected, so if you know of other systems that are affected by this please reply to this thread so we have a list.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =tcuu -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
