Thanks for constructing this comprehensive table, but please do not merge 14 and 15, or 1 and 5.  CVE assignment by MITRE most often has merges when the available information suggests one of these two situations:    A. Flaw types that have been used for many years and are thought to      be well understood. At present, a large fraction of our merges      are for XSS, SQL injection, CSRF, buffer overflows, integer      overflows, use-after-free issues, and directory traversal.      However, a merge can occur correctly for any flaw type.    B. The multiple pieces of disclosed information are identical except      for names and values. This occurs, for example, in disclosures of      incorrect permissions for multiple files. Another example is bad      passwords for multiple accounts.  At this point in the history of CWE, a discloser's choice of the same CWE identifier for two different bugs might not be a strong indication that a CVE merge should occur.  When a merge decision is unclear, it's almost always better not to merge. From the perspective of MITRE in producing CVE content, one primary reason is that a merge can make a CVE description difficult to understand. There are other reasons that are more important to other audiences. For example, some CVE consumers don't like situations in which a vendor publishes multiple disclosure documents that explain different aspects of the same CVE. Other CVE consumers don't like a shared name for two bugs that they will always discuss separately.  In the current case, we don't want to debate whether the CWE choices are "right" or "wrong" but instead just briefly indicate that there may be multiple perspectives and thus the merge decisions are unclear.  14 and 15: One might argue that these are different because 14 is about algorithmic complexity but 15 isn't.  01 and 05: One might argue that these are different because 05 is about incomplete security declarations but 01 isn't.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =QuVC -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
