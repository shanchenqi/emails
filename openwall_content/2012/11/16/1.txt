We didn't think this was about information disclosure. Our interpretation is that (aka bug is about which users are allowed to change the status of a bug:     http://www.mantisbt.org/manual/manual.configuration.status.settings.php says:    $g_update_bug_status_threshold   $g_set_status_threshold    These settings control the access level required to promote a bug   to a new status once the bug is opened. $g_set_status_threshold   is an array indexed by the status value that allows a distinct   setting for each status. It defaults to blank. If the appropriate   status is not defined above, $g_update_bug_status_threshold is   used instead. The default is DEVELOPER.  In other words, "all access levels as 'viewer'" doesn't mean that there's a confidentiality impact resulting from incorrect assignment of the VIEWER access level to additional persons. Instead, it means that there's an integrity impact because VIEWER access is sufficient to change a bug to any different status (Acknowledged, Confirmed, Assigned, Resolved, or Closed). The intended behavior was for VIEWER access to be insufficient, and DEVELOPER access to be sufficient. In a typical MantisBT installation, changing a bug to Closed would often be the worst scenario.  We agree that it's reasonable to have different CVE names for and even though both are closely related to the concept of incorrect privilege management.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJQpZLbAAoJEGvefgSNfHMdo4oIAKhxVaPWYaFylDww/g2sNdKG =mN6v -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
