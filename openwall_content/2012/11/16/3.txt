Here's an explanation of why MITRE didn't use  In YUI announced these three issues (see the URL):    charts.swf XSS affecting through   uploader.swf XSS affecting through   swfstore.swf XSS affecting through  These were assigned 3 CVEs to reflect the different affected versions:  The recent announcement at had an essentially identical pattern of affected versions. Because of this, we published 3 CVEs for consistency with the outcome:    charts.swf XSS affecting through   uploader.swf XSS affecting through   swfstore.swf XSS affecting through  needed to be rejected in the process:     We don't know why the original URL for the disclosure isn't available with its original content. (Currently is a redirect to the new web page.) In any case, the web.archive.org URL above has the data that supports the abstraction choice.  We'll most likely update and to delete the old     reference, and add the new     reference. We think this is a good idea when a discloser's original URL for one vulnerability is suddenly changed to only cover another vulnerability. (We're much less certain that it's a good idea to change to a web.archive.org URL, if one exists, in all of the many and error cases for other references in other CVEs.)  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =fn2A -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
