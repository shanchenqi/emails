Apology for the delay, I had some mail filter issues that I have now fixed so I won't miss these in future.  Also if there were any other CVE requests that were also CC'ed to full-disclosure or Bugtraq that I haven't dealt with please ping me and I'll get to them asap.  Please use this issue.   - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  iQIcBAEBAgAGBQJQtFUaAAoJEBYNRVNeJnmTnsoP+weCng3Etwm0gQZE/XsfCkee =kBhU -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
