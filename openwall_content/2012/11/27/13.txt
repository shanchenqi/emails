Christey" <coley@...-smtp.mitre.org> To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com cc: Moritz Muehlenhoff <jmm@...ian.org> Subject: Re: CVE request: Curl insecure usage   Kurt,  My read is that these are fairly straightforward issues, although the  number of implementations with this problem may be rather high :-(  opendnssec calls libcurl with an incorrect value "true" that's effectively  treated as the number 1, which is an insecure CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST  value.  So, opendnssec didn't call the API correctly - so the problem  rests with opendnssec.  For the handful of people interested - this is a kind of type confusion or  incorrect conversion error that affects a language other than C!  Kinda  cute.  For PHPcas, this is just calling the API with an insecure  CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST value, period.  So, I'd say that these faulty implementations each deserve their own CVE,  instead of a single ID for Curl.  - Steve   On Mon, 26 Nov Kurt Seifried wrote:  > -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- > Hash: SHA1 > > On AM, Moritz Muehlenhoff wrote: >> Hi, during the triage of the SSL client bugs spotted by the >> http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~shmat/shmat_ccs12.pdf paper Debian >> developer Alessandro Ghedini discovered two more applications using >> Curl in an insecure manner: >> >> 1. opendnssec (in the eppclient tool) >> >> >>  2.
