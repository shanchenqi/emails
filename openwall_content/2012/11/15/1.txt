Please try again with the same key.  I've just subscribed Premchand to linux-distros (and hence to distros as well).  I feel that the question of MontaVista's list membership is _mostly_ separate from who is subscribed for MontaVista, although I do see _some_ overlap between these two questions:  If MontaVista appoints someone not known in the community for doing relevant work before, then arguably this does suggest that MontaVista is less likely to be making good use of advance notification that the list provides.  A Google web search for "Premchand Koneru" finds primarily this very thread on oss-security.  This does look like a bad sign to me.  That said, Premchand is now subscribed, and I think we may want to revisit the topic of which distros are on the lists - a separate topic.  I think that MontaVista are not the only ones making arguably too little use of the info, and that's not good overall.  To single out MontaVista just because they happened to ask for a new person to be subscribed now would be wrong.  (In fact, by asking they demonstrated that they at least care, which is a good sign.)  I think it will never be clear where to draw the line, nor whether to host these lists at all.  It's always a trade-off, and it's subjective. As yet another non-perfect workaround, though, we could setup yet another two lists with just the distros who have demonstrated making good and timely use of the info - then let senders decide who to notify (all or the selected few).  Would this work well?  I doubt it, but we could try.
