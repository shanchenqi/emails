Thanks, Jason   ---------- Forwarded message ---------- From: Jason A. Donenfeld <Jason@...c4.com> Date: Thu, Nov 15, at AM Subject: [ANNOUNCE] CGIT Released To: cgit@...mli.net   Hi everyone,  It is with pleasure that I announce the first release of cgit in months, version This last release cycle has been a long one due to the disappearance of the former maintainer, Lars Hjemli, but rest assured, cgit is healthy and well, and I've been very pleased with the activity and excitement on this list.  Without further ado, here's the changelog for the latest release:  == ChangeLog ==  Enhancements: - path-selected submodule links - intelligent default branch guessing - /etc/mime.types lookup - gitweb.* and cgit.* git-config support - case insensitive sorting and age sorting - commit, repository, and section sorting - bold currently viewed page in pagination - support BSDs in makefile  Security: - heap-buffer overflow in parsing.c - syntax highlighting command injection  Bug Fixes: - transition maintainer to Jason Donenfeld (zx2c4) - download git snapshot from github instead of Lars' old server - css fixes - stablization of tests - more compatible default highlight script - suppress gzip timestamp so that tarballs only use tar timestamps - treat ctags as target in makefile - do not let global variables override certain local repo settings - print ampersand as proper html entity - use placeholder for empty commit subject - format diff view for addition and removal of files - point links at correct blob from ssdiff   == Downloading ==  The home of cgit is now here: http://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/about/  The repository can be cloned by: $ git clone http://git.zx2c4.com/cgit  A tarball of is here:  sha1 - If xz is no good for your distribution, a tar.gz and a tar.bz2 are available by tinkering with the URL.  For verification, I've gpg signed the tag which you can verify by cloning the repo. My public key is   == Moving Forward ==  For the next release cycle, there are a few things I look forward to seeing: - ssdiff tabulation fixes - authorization helper integration - fixing memory leaks - source file grepping   Thanks so much to everyone who contributed with great patches and enhancements.  -- Jason Donenfeld www.zx2c4.com  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
