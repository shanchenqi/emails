We're using PBKDF2 now for some time. The number of rounds can be configured and currently defaults to Note that we encode the used hashing function in the password field in the database. This allows us to upgrade existing passwords on user login to the new scheme. This also means existing installations can have a mixture of password hashing schemes in the DB.  The old default scheme was SHA-1 with no salt, see  This was changed to PBKDF2 in Release and there was still the bug [A] remaining in the anydbm backend which was fixed in This also shows how many people are using that backend (it's mainly used for demo)  Ralf --  Dr. Ralf Schlatterbeck                  Tel:   Open Source Consulting                  www:   http://www.runtux.com Reichergasse Weidling       email: office@...tux.com osAlliance member                       email: rsc@...lliance.com  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
