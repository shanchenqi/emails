A remote attacker could issue a specially-crafted LDAP search query, which once processed by a vulnerable slapd server would lead to assertion failure (slapd abort).  Upstream bug report: [1]  Original upstream patch: [2]   Further patches: [3]   [4]   References: [5] http://www.openldap.org/software/release/changes.html [6] [7] [8]  Could you allocate a CVE identifier for this?
