Tracking these issues is critical and it happens across dozens, and in some cases hundreds of vendors (e.g.  > The need for unified identifier for a particular issue is greatest > when discussing the problem and its potential solutions; Not how > someone actually solved it after it's already done.

If only it were that simple. Having worked for iSIGHT/iDefense prior to Red Hat, and now at Red Hat, let me say this simply:  CVE Is critical for security work at large scales.  Automated products/etc need reliable names for security issues. Customers need reliable ways to ask questions (did you fix that OpenSSL thing mentioned over in this random blog post? Oh you mean this CVE, yes. etc.).   --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
