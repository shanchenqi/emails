This doesn't need to be complicated.  Thanks for the clarification.  Josh has in the past been very useful with  OpenVAS and KDE bugs in particular where there is a security team who can take  up most of the slack and handle the co-ordination process.  Hopefully we won't  notice any changeover when we deal with you.  Totally agree about the information aspect FWIW, never had a problem sharing  in the past - it's just a matter of minimising the friction when disclosing.  Cheers, Tim  PS I suspect I'll be in touch sooner rather than later about CVEs, got a  handful that are almost ready for disclosure. --  Tim Brown <mailto:tmb@...35.com>  Download attachment "signature.asc " of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
