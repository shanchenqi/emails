There are no reference links to provide and I am not publicizing details on this list before the developer can be informed of the CVE.  I'm happy to take this off list as I am sure no one cares about any of this discussion but as I tried to do this privately initially before being told to email the list instead, I'm hesitant to bother.  Follow-up off list if you like, else I'll just skip this process and release advisories without them.
