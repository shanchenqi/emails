Would it be possible to get Drupal to list CVE's assigned for the issue on that page? It would make life easier for all concerned.  Ditto for the contrib page, 41 issues so far this year, I think a bunch have CVE's assigned but am not sure. Would it be possible to get Drupal to list CVE's assigned for the issue on that page? It would make life easier for all concerned.  I was planning to do a missing CVE assignment for Drupal this weekend (I'm guessing 40?).   --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
