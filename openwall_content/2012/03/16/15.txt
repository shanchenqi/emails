So here's my situation, I'm up for suggestions (of which, "wait longer", is perfectly viable!)...  1) March 1st, I sent 2 of these CVEs over to Steve Christy at MITRE who had previously allocated 9 prior CVEs in a day or two generally 2) March 8th, after not hearing back from Steve, I contacted cve@...redirectly with all 5 3) March 15th, after not hearing back from MITRE, I contacted Kurt off list as I've noted his helpfulness doing allocations 3a) Kurt pointed me to email the list, rather than him directly (which is perfectly fine, but perhaps not the context I was aiming for initially)  So we're moving past two weeks, I have 5 CVEs I am trying to allocate and talk with all of these developers to get on the same page which. None of these vulnerabilities are exactly going to rock the security world (see: but I'd love to be able to handle the process as MITRE intends (Introduction to CVE Identifier Reservation - http://cve.mitre.org/cve/cna.html) as I have previously 9 times with a lot of success.  I apologize if these requests fell outside of the regular scope of the list, but at this point I am just trying to get this process done with :)  -Mark  On Fri, Mar 16, at AM, Adam D.
