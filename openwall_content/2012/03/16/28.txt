Christey and decided that it would only be practical to do it for Drupal core for now and we could considering doing it for contrib in the future. Since that discussion there has only been one SA for Drupal core which I think has the CVEs on it: - Drupal core multiple vulnerabilities -  Is there another SA for core that I'm not considering? Is there a better way to list the CVE numbers?  There have been several SAs for contributed modules and we would gladly update them with CVEs. If you can send an email with a link to the SA and the CVE-id to use that would be great.  Our biggest problem with trying to integrate CVE values to the SAs for contributed modules is that the contributed projects are all run by individual volunteers and we don't reliably know the date we are going to release those. My understanding is that we can ask for a 2 week embargo on CVE requests and that would work most of the time but not all. We're working to improve the predictability of this process, but I think it's too early to consider getting CVE's in advance.
