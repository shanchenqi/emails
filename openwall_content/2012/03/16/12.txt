At that point, assigning a CVE id is mostly useless and is done as a "just for the record" thing.  The need for unified identifier for a particular issue is greatest when discussing the problem and its potential solutions; Not how someone actually solved it after it's already done. If CVE is to become a thing for changelogs only, all those projects that don't use one but rely on commit-messages instead won't use CVE id's at all, and the usefulness of the CVE database dwindles.  --  Andreas Ericsson                   andreas.ericsson@....se OP5 AB                             www.op5.se Tel: +46                  Fax: +46  Considering the successes of the wars on alcohol, poverty, drugs and terror, I think we should give some serious thought to declaring war on peace.
