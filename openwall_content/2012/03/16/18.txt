I'd say you may want to coordinate that documentation with Steve Christy as the nine times he allocated CVEs for me directly, this sort of conversation never came up. I can understand frustration on your part that people may not be educated, but realize that if CNAs handle this process differently, it may not be a matter of education on how 'the system works' but rather consistency within the entire process, agnostic of whom is allocating a CVE.  I again, do appreciate your time but I suppose I'll just wait for Steve or whomever is manning cve@...re to contact me back.
