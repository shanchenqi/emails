If Josh is no longer able to  fulfil that role due to a change of circumstance at Redhat it would be nice if  someone stepped into the breach -  be that Redhat, Debian or one of the other  CNAs.  There is definately a place for "disclosed to project, being/been fixed,  not public - can I have a CVE?" without deferring to the distros list or MITRE  - most of the time projects can respond in a timely fashion, so a minimum  effort approach is ideal.  As an aside, the public address for MITRE on the web site is wrong AFAIK.   Quoting Steve Christey:  "Apologies for the delay.  In the future, please use cve-assign@...re.org  for requests related to CVE reservation."  From last time I went to MITRE (for a closed source product).
