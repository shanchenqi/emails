Perhaps something like "If expect > upstream vendors to require more than days to develop a fix, establish a > release date with them prior to notifying this list".

Unfortunately, adding more clarity and specific examples would make the wiki page even longer and potentially more tempting to skim/skip.  For now, I opted to simplify the text quoted above to:  "Please notify upstream projects/developers of the affected software, other affected distro vendors, and/or affected Open Source projects before notifying one of these mailing lists in order to ensure that these other parties are OK with the maximum embargo period that would apply (and if not, then you may have to delay your notification to the mailing list), unless you're confident you'd choose to ignore their preference anyway and disclose the issue publicly soon as per the policy stated here."  This is slightly shorter and it let me add emphasis (bold face) in some places.
