In those cases the huge page faults can allocate hugepmds under pmd_none_or_clear_bad() and that can trigger a false positive from pmd_bad() that will not like to see a pmd materializing as trans huge.  A privileged user in the KVM guest can use this flaw to crash the host. An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system.  For detailed info please consult the upstream patch.
