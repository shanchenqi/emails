This is presents a risk for a denial of service because it means that a  remote attacker can violate the intent of the admin and overwhelm the  server running fcgid.  Could a CVE be assigned for this vulnerability?  If the admin declares that a given virtualhost should be limited to X  fastcgi processes (often in order to constrain RAM usage by the vhost),  any remote user can issue X+1 (or 10X, or whatever) concurrent GET  requests, which defeats the documented limit, and can result in heavy  swap or the oom-killer, which can cause a DoS on other services on the host.  This bug has been fixed since the release of in upstream's svn  of https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/mod_fcgid/trunk)  with a narrowly-targeted one-line patch:  --- modules/fcgid/fcgid_spawn_ctl.c	(revision +++ modules/fcgid/fcgid_spawn_ctl.c	(revision @@ @@           if (current_node->inode == command->inode               && current_node->deviceid == command->deviceid               && !strcmp(current_node->cmdline, command->cmdline) -            && current_node->vhost_id == sconf->vhost_id +            && current_node->vhost_id == command->vhost_id               && current_node->uid == command->uid               && current_node->gid == command->gid)               break;  But this patch hasn't made it to any released version.  Debian has plans to release a Debian Security Advisory for the issue and  will resolve it with the above patch.
