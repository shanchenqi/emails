There's already a wiki page on CVE IDs, but it is very brief and it does not mention obtaining CVE IDs via oss-security or distros lists.  You could want to update it and add links to it from other relevant oss-security wiki pages.  http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/disclosure/cve  Thanks,  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
