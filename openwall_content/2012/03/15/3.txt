It's in the best interest of all list members to fix issues in a timely manner. The historic vendor-sec never had a serious problem with CRD. They were often outside of the current proposed 14 day span, but that's just a reality of how things go. We all have more work to do than time, so some things are bound to suffer.  Trying to get a couple people to do this is going to be a losing battle. We need to think about how to best let the list police itself. It certainly won't be perfect, but I think even an 80% reasonable CRD agreement goal is acceptable (perfect is the enemy of the good comes to mind).  I would suggest some reasonable guidelines (that are not enforced strictly), then see how things go for a while. If it's deemed unacceptable, a better solution can be worked on.  Thanks.  --      JB  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
