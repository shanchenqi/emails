Actually, I didn't manually encrypt the attachment, but my mail client's PGP plugin likely did the equivalent.  PGP/MIME is definitely preferred, but since certain Windows-based mail clients utterly fail at interpreting it properly, I often fall back to old style PGP when sending messages to strangers.  I think your updated text helps.   > "If you have not yet notified upstream projects/developers of the > affected software, other affected distro vendors, and/or affected Open > Source projects, you may want to do so before notifying one of these > mailing lists in order to ensure that these other parties are OK with > the maximum embargo period that would apply (and if not, then you may > have to delay your notification to the mailing list), unless you're > confident you'd choose to ignore their preference anyway and disclose > the issue publicly soon as per the policy stated here."  You may want to re-word this a little to make it utterly clear to those who don't take the time to think about it.  Perhaps something like "If expect upstream vendors to require more than days to develop a fix, establish a release date with them prior to notifying this list".  You could also break it down in to step-by-step bullets.  That page has grown much larger now and it is tempting to skim...   > Also, apparently it is still common practice to delay documenting > security fixes in office products as such - that is, since releases take > so long to prepare and test, they're first built with security fixes > included but undocumented, they're even made publicly available for > testing, and only then they're finalized and the security fixes become > publicly known as such.

I agree with you that releasing undocumented fixes carries significant risks. It's become clear to me that the LO/OO projects have a ways to go when it comes to release engineering.  tim  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
