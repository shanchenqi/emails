It is the second major violation so far; the first one was for HashDoS, and it was similarly discussed on oss-security after the fact:   It's cases like this that may eventually make us reconsider and stop hosting the non-public lists.  (Some propose automatic publishing of messages after N days as an alternative.)  Luckily, so far violations like this have been relatively rare, and one of the reasons why I feel every one of them needs attention is to keep it so.  I've included more detail below:  On Sat, Mar 24, at VSR Advisories wrote: >    OpenOffice, LibreOffice, AbiWord, KOffice, and libraptor >               maintainers were provided a draft advisory and test sample. >               The OpenWall "distros" mailing list was also notified. >               Apache OpenOffice Security team acknowledged notification. >               libraptor developer confirmed flaw. >  >    assigned by Apache. >  >    Notified OpenWall "distros" mailing list again, due to previous >               technical problems.  IIRC, the "technical problems" being referred to here were an attachment not being re-encrypted to list members, so they only had partial info until this point - essentially just the fact that there's a vulnerability in those products, but with no detail; given the extra embargo time (not needed by distro vendors) this may actually be good. The list setup is a bit picky about what encrypted message formats it supports (besides plaintext, they may be PGP/MIME or PGP inline, but they can't have individual pre-encrypted attachments - this has since been clarified on the wiki).  >    libraptor developer provided patches to all notified parties. >  >    Extensive arguing between vendors about embargo/release date. >  >    More arguing about release date. >  >    Agreed upon release date established. >  >    Security updates and vendor advisories released. >  >    VSR advisory released.  At the time of the initial notification in January, the distros list policy was to allow a maximum embargo period of 14 days (and this was stated on the wiki page with the list posting address).  At the time of the second notification in February, the policy was stated as:  "Please note that the maximum acceptable embargo period for issues disclosed to these lists is 14 to 19 days, with embargoes longer than 14 days (up to 19) allowed in case the issue is reported on a Thursday or a Friday and the proposed coordinated disclosure date is thus adjusted to fall on a Monday or a Tuesday.  Please do not ask for a longer embargo. In fact, embargo periods shorter than 7 days are preferable."  When it became apparent that this was to be violated since one or two of the affected upstreams wanted much more time, the reporter (Timothy D. Morgan of VSR Security) explained that at the time of his initial notification he had thought that 14 days would in fact be enough.  While this sounds like a rather fundamental problem with a maximum embargo time policy (it is always possible that something new is discovered during discussion, which may invalidate the initial time estimate of the reporter), I've just added the following verbiage to hopefully reduce the number of such occurrences going forward:  "If you have not yet notified upstream projects/developers of the affected software, other affected distro vendors, and/or affected Open Source projects, you may want to do so before notifying one of these mailing lists in order to ensure that these other parties are OK with the maximum embargo period that would apply (and if not, then you may have to delay your notification to the mailing list), unless you're confident you'd choose to ignore their preference anyway and disclose the issue publicly soon as per the policy stated here."  Of course, I fully expect this attempt to sometimes fail, but maybe - just maybe - it will help in some cases.  There's no perfect solution here (although some would reasonably argue that simply not doing any pre-disclosure coordination is perfect - in a way it is).  The time required by the free office product vendors to issue a security fix here reminded me of web browsers in  Several web browser vendors have since learned to issue security fixes much quicker, but apparently office vendors still lack processes to do so.  Besides, the timing of the move of OpenOffice to Apache Incubator introduced a delay here (I think it was the very first release of Apache OpenOffice). I hope further security issues won't be taking this long to fix in released versions (such as through quick new releases or a binary update capability for existing releases).  Also, apparently it is still common practice to delay documenting security fixes in office products as such - that is, since releases take so long to prepare and test, they're first built with security fixes included but undocumented, they're even made publicly available for testing, and only then they're finalized and the security fixes become publicly known as such.  This too is or should hopefully be a practice of the past as it relates to some other software, and let's just pretend that I naively hope it will be gone for these products (which is closely related to being able to fix security issues and push such fixes to the users quicker).  I'd appreciate any comments and suggestions - preferably on the public oss-security list.  (Suggestions sent to me in private are a lot less valuable since I can't fully refer to them.)
