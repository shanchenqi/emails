Besides, I'll need to post a follow-up on its handling.  Hence the forward.  I've just updated http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros to say:  "When the security issue is finally to be made public, it is your (the original reporter's) responsibility to post about it to oss-security (indeed, you and others may also post to any other mailing lists, etc.)"  ----- Forwarded message from VSR Advisories <advisories@...curity.com> -----  Date: Sat, 24 Mar From: VSR Advisories <advisories@...curity.com> To: bugtraq@...urityfocus.com, full-disclosure@...ts.grok.org.uk Subject: libraptor - XXE in RDF/XML File Interpretation  (Multiple  office products affected)  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1                            VSR Security Advisory                        http://www.vsecurity.com/  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  Advisory Name: libraptor - XXE in RDF/XML File Interpretation  Release Date:  Applications: libraptor / librdf (versions 1.x and 2.x) Also Affected: OpenOffice 3.x, LibreOffice 3.x, AbiWord, KOffice        Author: tmorgan {a} vsecurity * com Vendor Status: Patches available; major downstream vendors                and operating system distributions notified CVE Candidate:     Reference:  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=   Product Description ~-----------------~ "Raptor is a free software / Open Source C library that provides a set of  parsers and serializers that generate Resource Description Framework (RDF)  triples by parsing syntaxes or serialize the triples into a syntax. The  supported parsing syntaxes are RDF/XML, N-Quads, N-Triples, TRiG, Turtle, RSS  tag soup including all versions of RSS, Atom 1.0 and 0.3, GRDDL and  microformats for HTML, XHTML and XML and RDFa. The serializing syntaxes are  RDF/XML (regular, and abbreviated), Atom 1.0, GraphViz, JSON, N-Quads,  N-Triples, RSS 1.0 and XMP." -- libraptor web site [1]  libraptor is a component of librdf[2] which is used by a variety of open source software to interpret Resource Description Framework (RDF) [3] formats.   Vulnerability Overview ~--------------------~ In December VSR identified a vulnerability in multiple open source office products (including OpenOffice, LibreOffice, KOffice, and AbiWord) due to unsafe interpretation of XML files with custom entity declarations. Deeper analysis revealed that the vulnerability was caused by acceptance of external entities by the libraptor library, which is used by librdf and is in turn used by these office products.  In the context of office applications, these vulnerabilities could allow for XML External Entity (XXE) attacks resulting in file theft and a loss of user privacy when opening potentially malicious ODF documents.  For other applications which depend on librdf or libraptor, potentially serious consequences could result from accepting RDF/XML content from untrusted sources, though the impact may vary widely depending on the context.   Vulnerability Details ~-------------------~ Open Document Format (ODF) files consist of a collection of several different files stored in a ZIP archive.  Included in this set is a "manifest.rdf" file which is formatted according to the RDF/XML representation.  The RDF format is intended to be used for storing metadata associated with specific document elements.  The manifest.rdf file can reference secondary RDF files within the ODF file as well as external document schemas.  The RDF file parser (librdf) used by the affected office products allows DTD specifications within the RDF files themselves.  In addition, the parser interprets external entities which may reference arbitrary external files, HTTP and FTP resources.  For instance, the following "evil.rdf" file was created within a valid ODF text archive (.odt file) which was referenced by the internal manifest.rdf file:   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> <!DOCTYPE rdf [    <!ENTITY file SYSTEM "file:///c:/windows/win.ini"> ]> <rdf:RDF   <rdf:Description     <ns0:comment   </rdf:Description> </rdf:RDF>    Upon opening the malicious .odt file in OpenOffice for Windows, the c:\windows\win.ini file was read and included in the document metadata.  Upon saving the document, this metadata was included literally in the resulting evil.rdf file (within the .odt):  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> <rdf:RDF   <rdf:Description     <ns1:comment for 16-bit app support [fonts] [extensions] [mci extensions] [files] [Mail] MAPI=1 CMC=1 MAPIX=1 OLEMessaging=1 </ns1:comment>   </rdf:Description> </rdf:RDF>   The malicious XML entities could also include URLs to attacker-controlled HTTP or FTP resources.  This would allow an attacker to determine when a document was opened, potentially resulting in reduced privacy.  However, based on current analysis of the affected office applications, the most serious attack scenario is likely to be:  1. Attacker posts a malicious file on a web site or sends file to victim.  The file contains a form for the victim to fill out and return to the attacker.  2. Victim fills out the form, saves it, sends it back to the attacker.  3. Attacker is able to read the contents of any stolen files as embedded metadata, simply by unzipping the returned file and reading the malicious RDF component.   This attack clearly requires some significant user interaction.  However, other applications which rely on librdf/libraptor have not been analyzed.  It is plausible that the context of the external entity interpretation in other software could allow for more serious automated file retrieval attacks.   Versions Affected ~---------------~ The 1.x and 2.x major versions of librdf are affected.  Thus far, all recent versions of open source office products appear to be affected, since these products rely on librdf/raptor for the interpretation of RDF files.  This, in turn relies on libxml2 which supports external entity interpretation by default. OpenOffice and LibreOffice include a modified copy of librdf 1.x which was vulnerable at the time of testing.  It is likely that all previously release 3.x versions of OpenOffice and LibreOffice are vulnerable. AbiWord and KOffice rely on a copy of librdf which is installed by the underlying operating system.  Numerous other open source software packages depend on librdf or libraptor (including ardour, libslv2, lv2file, morla, soprano, and numerous language-specific wrappers), but it is not known if these are exploitable in any realistic scenario.   Vendor Response ~-------------~ The following timeline provides an overview of communication with the primary affected vendors:     OpenOffice, LibreOffice, AbiWord, KOffice, and libraptor               maintainers were provided a draft advisory and test sample.               The OpenWall "distros" mailing list was also notified.               Apache OpenOffice Security team acknowledged notification.               libraptor developer confirmed flaw.     assigned by Apache.     Notified OpenWall "distros" mailing list again, due to previous               technical problems.     libraptor developer provided patches to all notified parties.     Extensive arguing between vendors about embargo/release date.     More arguing about release date.     Agreed upon release date established.     Security updates and vendor advisories released.     VSR advisory released.   Recommendation ~------------~ Users of most open source operating system distributions should update to the latest librdf package as soon as possible, once a patched version is available for their distribution.  OpenOffice and LibreOffice packages should also be upgraded, since these include a custom copy of the library.  Users of other operating systems who use LibreOffice or OpenOffice should upgrade these packages to the latest release versions as soon as possible.  Developers of software which rely on librdf or libraptor should assess the risk of XXE attacks on interpreted XML files and take appropriate actions to notify their users based on how their software operates.  VSR would be happy to assist developers in these efforts on a case-by-case basis.   Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Information ~----------------------------------------------------~ The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the number to this issue.  This is a candidate for inclusion in the CVE list (http://cve.mitre.org), which standardizes names for security problems.
