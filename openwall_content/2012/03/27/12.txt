I think this is a good idea.  I likely misunderstood the process you want researchers to follow when it comes to using the distros list.  While I think the time to release for this issue was excessive, I should have nailed down a release date with the upstreams prior to notifying the distros list.   I'll reserve some additional comments for the oss-security list exclusively.
