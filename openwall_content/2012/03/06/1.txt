LDAP Account Manager includes a reduced copy of the phpLDAPadmin code. I already checked if phpLDAPadmin contains a fix and it seems to be vulnerable, too. Therefore, I cloned the Debian bug.  The Debian bug report contains a patch for Debian Stable. Debian packages for Unstable are here:  http://www.ldap-account-manager.org/static/debian-packages/   --   Best regards  Roland  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
