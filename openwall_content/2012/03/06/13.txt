Credit: Mateusz Jurczyk, Google Security Team  Note: Though some the issues below might look like related / the same, I have        checked that each of them exclude themselves (IOW each of them is different        issue like the another. But was lazy to cross-reference those, which of them        is different from which another.         Reproducers are attached to relevant upstream bug reports.         Have Cc-ed Werner Lemberg of FreeType upstream on this post too, so he could        collect CVE identifiers prior FreeType release.         Yet, requesting CVE identifier even for the NULL ptr dereference and floating        point exception / integer divide by zero issue below, even if Red Hat would not        consider these to be security flaws. But other distributions might be doing so,        thus will let Steve to decide, if these two desire CVE identifiers or not.         And finally, due the count of the issues, not including full issues description        under each entry (to shorten the request). Only particular Red Hat Bugzilla entry        summary is included with relevant links to upstream bugs and commits. Further issue        description can be found under particular Red Hat Bugzilla entry for each of them        in initial comment (#c0).  Kurt, Steve, could you allocate CVE identifiers for these?  Thank you && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team     Issue #1: =========    freetype: Out-of heap-based buffer read by parsing, adding properties in BDF    fonts, or validating if property being an atom  Upstream bug reports: [1] [2]  Upstream patch: [3]   Red Hat Bugzilla entry: [4]  Issue #2: =========    freetype: Out-of heap-based buffer read by parsing glyph information and    bitmaps for BDF fonts  Upstream bug reports: [1] [2]  Upstream patch: [3]   Red Hat Bugzilla entry: [4]  Issue #3: =========    freetype: NULL pointer dereference by moving zone2 pointer point for certain    TrueType font  Upstream bug report: [1]  Upstream patch: [2]   Red Hat Bugzilla entry: [3]  Issue #4: =========    freetype: Out-of heap-based buffer read when parsing certain SFNT strings    by Type42 font parser  Upstream bug report: [1]  Upstream patch: [2]   Red Hat Bugzilla entry: [3]  Issue #5: =========    freetype: Out-of heap-based buffer read by loading properties of PCF    fonts  Upstream bug report: [1]  Upstream patch: [2]   Red Hat Bugzilla entry: [3]  Issue #6: =========    freetype (64-bit specific): Out-of heap-based buffer read by attempt to    record current cell into the cell table  Upstream bug report: [1]  Upstream patch: [2]   Red Hat Bugzilla entry: [3]  Issue #7: =========    freetype: Out-of heap-based buffer read flaw in Type1 font loader by    parsing font dictionary entries  Upstream bug report: [1]  Upstream patch: [2]   Red Hat Bugzilla entry: [3]  Issue #8: =========    freetype: Out-of heap-based buffer write by parsing BDF glyph information    and bitmaps  Upstream bug report: [1]  Upstream patch: [2]   Red Hat Bugzilla entry: [3]  Issue #9: =========    freetype: Out-of heap-based buffer write in Type1 font parser by retrieving    font's private dictionary  Upstream bug report: [1]  Upstream patch: [2]   Red Hat Bugzilla entry: [3]  Issue #10: ==========    freetype: Out-of heap-based buffer read in TrueType bytecode interpreter    by executing NPUSHB and NPUSHW instructions  Upstream bug report: [1]  Upstream patch: [2]   Red Hat Bugzilla entry: [3]  Issue #11: ==========    freetype: Out-of heap-based buffer write by parsing BDF glyph and bitmaps    information with missing ENCODING field  Upstream bug report: [1]  Upstream patch: [2]   Red Hat Bugzilla entry: [3]  Issue #12: ==========    freetype: Out-of heap-based buffer read by parsing BDF font header  Upstream bug report: [1]  Upstream patch: [2]   Red Hat Bugzilla entry: [3]  Issue #13: ==========    freetype: Out-of heap-based buffer read in the TrueType bytecode    interpreter by executing the MIRP instruction  Upstream bug report: [1]  Upstream patch: [2]   Red Hat Bugzilla entry: [3]  Issue #14: ==========    freetype: Array index error, leading to out-of stack based buffer    read by parsing BDF font glyph information  Upstream bug report: [1]  Upstream patch: [2]   Red Hat Bugzilla entry: [3]  Issue #15: ==========    freetype: Out-of heap-based buffer read by conversion of PostScript font objects  Upstream bug report: [1]  Upstream patch: [2]   Red Hat Bugzilla entry: [3]  Issue #16: ==========    freetype: Out-of heap-based buffer read flaw by conversion of an ASCII    string into a signed short integer by processing BDF fonts  Upstream bug report: [1]  Upstream patch: [2]   Red Hat Bugzilla entry: [3]  Issue #17: ==========    freetype: Out-of heap-based buffer write by retrieval of advance values    for glyph outlines  Upstream bug report: [1]  Upstream patch: [2]   Red Hat Bugzilla entry: [3]  Issue #18: ==========    freetype: Integer divide by zero by performing arithmetic    computations for certain fonts  Upstream bug report: [1]  Upstream patch: [2]   Red Hat Bugzilla entry: [3]  Issue #19: ==========    freetype: Out-of heap-based buffer write in the TrueType bytecode    interpreter by moving zone2 pointer point  Upstream bug report: [1]  Upstream patch: [2]   Red Hat Bugzilla entry: [3]  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
