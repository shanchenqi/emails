Sorry, slowly catching up on mails here.  Whether that is right or wrong, I'm not sure; you'd have to ask upstream.  I just did the diff since I couldn't find a svn/git repo web interface to generate a patch, so if it's wrong, then upstream has got it wrong as well.  I see that Fedora has used a patch (not sure if it's the same or not), so if I get a chance in the next few days I'll try the new version to try to validate the fix.  --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
