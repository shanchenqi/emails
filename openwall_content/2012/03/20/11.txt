Based on further investigation, I am able to tell the issues here are out-of heap-based buffer reads and / or invalid pointer dereferences by processing various parts of CDF (Composite Document Files) header.  Out-of heap-based buffer reads: i)   either by attempt to access field at invalid index, ii)  or by attempt to access field out of allocated array bounds.  Invalid pointer dereferences: iii) by attempt to access pointer value, being modified in       a for loop cycle.  Anyway, the file executable is terminated in each case yet by attempt to read the location, thus these seem to be able to cause just file executable crashes.  Relevant Red Hat Bugzilla record is here: [1]  Though issues having lower impact, would it be possible to allocate one CVE identifier to these? (one should be enough, since the reason is always the same and the underlying code is parsing CDF file header).
