A normal workflow would be to work with the vendor(s) on fixing it and then when they release an update you release a security advisory publicly at the same time or later (e.g. to give people time to update).  > Should I post them to vendor-sec? We don't want the details to leak to the public before the fix is fully rolled out, but we'd like to start working on the content of the CVE (make sur you have all needed information, etc.).  Vendor-sec no longer exists, the linux-distros list has replaced it, http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/linux-distros  you can certainly post there but be aware that issues posted there typically fall under a 2 week max embargo, so if you need longer you should hold off. Also linux-distros really only applies for stuff that Linux/BSD distros ship, third party software that no-one ships isn't really all that relevant. I have no idea if anyone ships eZ publish.  > Also, should I continue posting to oss-sec, or mailing you (Kurt) is enough?  I don't need anything else, I just assign the CVE's. Mitre does the actual write up based on info, publishing, etc. Posting to oss-sec is ideal, they will see it for sure.  > Regards, > Luc.    --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
