A rogue server could provide a specially-crafted database warning or specially-crafted DBD statement, which once processed by the perl-DBD-Pg interface would lead to perl-DBD-Pg based process crash.  References: [1] [2]  CPAN ticket: [3]  Patch proposed by Niko Tyni: [4]   Case #2: ======== Multiple format string flaws were found in the way perl-YAML-LibYAML, Perl YAML serialization using XS and libyaml, performed: 1) error reporting by loading of general YAML stream, 2) error reporting by loading of YAML node, 3) error reporting by loading of YAML mapping into a Perl hash, and 4) error reporting by loading of YAML sequence into a Perl array.  A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted YAML document, which once processed by the perl-YAML-LibYAML interface would lead to perl-YAML-LibYAML based process crash.  References: [1] [2]  CPAN tickets: [3] [4]  Proposed patch: [5]  Could you allocate two CVE ids for these? (one for libdbd-pg-perl / perl-DBD-Pg and one for libyaml-libyaml-perl / perl-YAML-LibYAML)  Thank you && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
