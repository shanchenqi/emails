BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at  IP:  Pid: comm: kworker/0:2 Not tainted #9 Bochs Bochs  RIP:   RSP:  EFLAGS:  Process kworker/0:2 (pid: threadinfo task  Call Trace:        A local attacker able to register threshold events could use this flaw to crash the system.  The earliest commit that *might* introduce this issue is in I haven't tested it though and the code isi slightly different.  On the current kernels without the fix I'm able to reproduce the bug easily.
