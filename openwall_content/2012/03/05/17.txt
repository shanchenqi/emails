When the abrt C handler plug-in and core dumps for setuid and setgid processes were enabled (via fs.suid_dumpable=2), an unprivileged local user could use this flaw to obtain access to core dump files of setuid processes, which terminated with crash and were run by the same unprivileged user, leading to disclosure of sensitive information due to weak GID permissions, those core dump files were created with.
