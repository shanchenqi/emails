Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: kernel: vlan: fix panic when handling priority tagged  frames  A partner reported that frames with priority tags only (VID=0 in the frame), could cause a panic on some drivers. It affects the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 due to incorrect backporting of upstream patches. It does not affect the upstream kernel.
