Potentially stupid Q, why no CVE request from Debian? I'm happy to assign them, especially for stuff that qualifies for a DSA, it will almost certainly qualify for a CVE. If you need one for an embargoed issue please email the OpenWall vs list (http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros) and I can assign it there.  --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
