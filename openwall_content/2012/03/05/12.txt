This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.  * 2) Input passed to the "filter" POST parameter in lam/templates/3rdParty/pla/htdocs/cmd.php (when "cmd" is set to "export" and "exporter_id" is set to "LDIF") is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.  * 3) Input passed to the "attr" parameter in lam/templates/3rdParty/pla/htdocs/cmd.php (when "cmd" is set to "add_value_form" and "dn" is set to a valid value) is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.  References: [1] [2]  Later it was reported: [3]  that subset (for 'export', 'add_value_form', and 'dn' variables) of these security flaws is applicable also against the code of PhpLDAPadmin, a web-based LDAP client.  Patches from LDAP Account Manager, which are applicable to PphLDAPAdmin: [4]   [5]  [6]   I would swear, I have seen LDAP Account Manager CVE request on OSS security mailing list recently, but can't find it now quickly right now. Kurt, please prior assigning CVE ids to "LDAP Account Manager Pro" please double check the main CVE mitre database, if these didn't get a CVE identifier yet.  Wrt to PhpLDAPAdmin side -- I am not sure, what's the relation of the code between LAM and PLA (if PLA is using / embedding some code of LAM directly or if there were also some customizations on the side of PLA upon LAM code embedding / inclusion). Hopefully Roland, Fabio, Dmitry can clarify here, how much the PhpLDAPAdmin code is different from LDAP Account Manager code (if it's just overtaken LAM code or PhpLDAPAdmin have also made their own customizations to the code)?  Roland, Fabio, Dmitry, basically what we are searching an answer for is, if the PhpLDAPAdmin code is different enough it safe to be considered as a different code base and separate CVE identifier to be allocated for it? (IOW one for LDAP Account Manager Pro issues, the other for PhpLDAPAdmin issues)  Kurt, once the above doubt solved and you checked and confirmed, that LDAP Account Manager issue did not get CVE identifier in the recent past yet, could you allocate those?
