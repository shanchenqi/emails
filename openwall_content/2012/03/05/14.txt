OVERVIEW  Open-Realty and lower versions are vulnerable to Local File Inclusion.   2. BACKGROUND  Open-Realty is the world's leading real estate listing marketing and management CMS application, and has enjoyed being the real estate web site software of choice for professional web site developers since   3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION  Open-Realty contains a flaw that may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands or code. The issue is due to the 'index.php' script not properly sanitizing user input, specifically directory traversal style attacks (e.g., ../../) supplied to the 'select_users_template' parameter. This may allow an attacker to include a file from the targeted host that contains arbitrary commands or code that will be executed by the vulnerable script. Such attacks are limited due to the script only calling files already on the target host. In addition, this flaw can potentially be used to disclose the contents of any file on the system accessible by the web server.   4. VERSIONS AFFECTED  (2.x.x) <=   5. PROOF-OF-CONCEPT/EXPLOIT    6.
