Thanks. > > The issues which were present in the development head were :-  [1] A crafted ogg file with sampleRate as "0" leads to crash in the application using taglib.          fixed in the commit - [2] "vendorLength" field modification in ogg tag parsing causes crash in the application using taglib.          fixed in the commit -   The issues which are present in the latest "release" but not in the current development head were :-  [3] Lack of sanity checks of fields which were read, and were used for allocating memory; crafted files would lead of application crash. [4] A one bit change in a working ogg file would cause a thread to loop infinitely.  *Please note* :-  [1] and [2] were fixed after the report, and could be assigned CVE's.  I am unsure about the other two, as they were fixed in the development branch, prior to our report. However, a release has not been made with the patches for [3] and [4] yet. Kindly assign CVE's for [3] and [4] if you see it fit to do so.
