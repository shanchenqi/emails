Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: kernel: regset: Prevent null pointer reference on readonly  regsets  Description: The regset common infrastructure assumed that regsets would always have .get and .set methods, but not necessarily .active methods. Unfortunately people have since written regsets without .set methods.  Rather than putting in stub functions everywhere, handle regsets with null .get or .set methods explicitly.  Credit: H.
