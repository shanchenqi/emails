I'll do so below:  On Tue, Mar 13, at Solar Designer wrote: > I could use some help running the distros list and its linux-distros > sub-list.

What I'd like to be happening is for some list member(s) (not too many of them) to be proposing a CRD for each reported issue on the day it is reported.  Then those member(s) need to stay on top of all open issues and ensure the CRDs are met (if necessary, adjusting the CRDs as long as the list's limit permits).  Quite often, this will involve negotiations with other list members, with the reporter, with upstream(s), and with various other parties (such as related projects and distros who are not on the list).  Yes, this does sound CERT'ish. ;-)  > Could one or several distros and/or linux-distros list members please > accept this responsibility?
