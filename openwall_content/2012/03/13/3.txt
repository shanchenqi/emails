Yes, this does sound CERT'ish. ;-)  Does this person contact upstream(s)? If not, who does? Does this person contact downstreams? Or are they assumed to read distros@? What if an up- or downstream claims to need longer (confer a recent issue)? When CRD happens, who publishes what where? Or is it just a free-for-all afterwards?  Just off the top of my head :)  Thomas  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
