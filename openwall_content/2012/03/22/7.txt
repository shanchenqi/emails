Thoughts/comments (anyone strongly against this)?  Since random(3) is not a cryptographically secure random function I'm not sure that is makes sense to assign a CVE.  I suppose it really depends on the likelihood of someone calling srandom(0); I don't know why anyone would do that on purpose.  If you must use random(3) instead of something stronger like arc4random(3), it is possible to seed the PRNG via /dev/arandom using srandomdev(3) or set the seed state manually via initstate(3), both of which provide more than just 32 bits of seed data.   - todd  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
