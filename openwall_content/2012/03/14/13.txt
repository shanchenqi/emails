I should probably add OpenVAS to that list, but my real reason for responding  was to mention the OSVDB vendor dictionary at:  * http://www.osvdb.org/vendors  It's definately a good place to start if you're trying to track down vendors,  F/OSS or otherwise.  Perhaps this is something where oss-security could  colaborate with the existing effort?
