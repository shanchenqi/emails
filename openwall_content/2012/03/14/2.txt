Could I request that two CVEs be issued for two separate crashes in Pidgin?  To my knowledge no CVE exists for either issue. Both issues were reported in our public bug tracker, and are therefore public.  The issues are described at the following two URLs: http://pidgin.im/news/security/?id=60 http://pidgin.im/news/security/?id=61  The Pidgin project has just released version which fixes both issues.
