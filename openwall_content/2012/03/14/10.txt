Can we also maintain a public database of upstream contacts? I seem to remember a few different efforts to do this but can't find anything current. This would save a ton of time. It would of course have to be maintained (maybe a scheme like emailing the people listed every few months and offering a "click here to confirm you're still the security contact" and a "click here to be removed as the contact" to help keep it up to date). Also things like PGP keys/etc would be nice to have in this. It strikes me that this would actually be a valuable project for Mitre, similar to CPE, maybe the "SCE" ("Security Contact Enumeration")?  As anyone trying to notify multiple upstreams knows, it can be a horribly painful process.  > Alexander  --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
