We have this wiki page:  http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/software  It currently lists Apache, Asterisk, ..., Xine, X.Org - just to give an idea of what projects chose to add themselves or were added.  By all means, please help keep this wiki page current and use it.  We also have:  http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/vendors http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/infrastructure  > This would save a ton of time.

Well, we don't have that currently, and I'm not sure if it'd work well in practice or not.  I imagine that some upstreams would be offended by the automated messages, yet they could also be offended by not being notified of an issue affecting their software (and more importantly their users would be affected).  > Also things like PGP keys/etc would be nice to have in this.  Right.  Please feel free to add PGP key info to the wiki pages above.  > It strikes me that this would actually be a valuable project for > Mitre, similar to CPE, maybe the "SCE" ("Security Contact Enumeration")?  Maybe.  > As anyone trying to notify multiple upstreams knows, it can be a > horribly painful process.  Yes, but my gut feeling is that identifying the right set of projects to notify is at least as difficult and time-consuming as finding their current contact info is.  Of course, anything we can do to make any of the steps easier may be of help.  Kurt - how about my original request for help running the list, though? Even if you somehow don't volunteer to notify upstreams (and others), making sure that every issue gets a CRD proposed for it ASAP will be of help.  Can I at least count on you doing that? ;-)  And maybe someone else will volunteer for other sub-tasks (although a per-vulnerability rather than per-sub-task split between the several responsible list members could work better, I think).
