Mark, if the patch is released, that means it's public even if the details are not publicly discussed. Provide the patch information (hash, link to the patch, etc), and we will assign CVE names. No one will be confused if there are duplicate names assigned to them.  If you are not comfortable talking about these issues in public, sure, use http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros. And we will follow-up from there.  Keep Steve and/or MITRE cc'ed.  No one wants to make things difficult for you. If everyone does their part, names will be allocated very quickly.
