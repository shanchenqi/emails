The original fix for failed to check for the possibility of an integer overflow when computing the sum of "number_bytes" and "offset". This resulted in a wrap around into a value smaller than "length", making original introduced "length" check still to be possible to bypass, leading to memory corruption.  We have assigned identifier for the incomplete fix of the issue.  Relevant upstream patches: [1] [2]  Red Hat Bugzilla bug: [3]   The original fix for failed to correct the denial of service condition in "profile.c" source code part, too. This still allowed the specially-crafted image file, when processed for example by the "convert" executable, to cause original problem (denial of service).  We have assigned identifier for the incomplete fix of the issue.  Relevant upstream patch (same as [1] above): [4]   Red Hat Bugzilla entry: [5]  Thanks and kind regards, --  Stefan Cornelius / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
