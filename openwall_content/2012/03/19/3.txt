Many small projects don't use changelogs or track issues all that carefully after they're fixed, but rely entirely on commit messages to keep (and give) such information to its users.  Then again, I'm speaking from a developer standpoint and I generally need (well, want, but for the sake of issue history I should say "strongly prefer to have") the id long before most users even know there's a problem.  By this thread I'm fairly assured that won't be a problem though, so I'll refrain from commenting further.  Thanks to all who clarified.  --  Andreas Ericsson                   andreas.ericsson@....se OP5 AB                             www.op5.se Tel: +46                  Fax: +46  Considering the successes of the wars on alcohol, poverty, drugs and terror, I think we should give some serious thought to declaring war on peace.
