It was possible for a user > account with the block privileges to block or unblock another user without > providing a token. > > For more details, see  Please use for this issue.   > It was discovered that the resource loader can leak certain kinds of private > data across domain origin boundaries, by providing the data as an executable > JavaScript file. In MediaWiki and later, this includes the leaking of CSRF > protection tokens. This allows compromise of the wiki's user accounts, say by > changing the user's email address and then requesting a password reset. > > For more details, see  Please use for this issue.   > Jan Schejbal of Hatforce.com discovered a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) > vulnerability in Special:Upload. Modern browsers (since at least as early as > December are able to post file uploads without user interaction, > violating previous security assumptions within MediaWiki. > > Depending on the wiki's configuration, this vulnerability could lead to further > compromise, especially on private wikis where the set of allowed file types is > broader than on public wikis. Note that CSRF allows compromise of a wiki from > an external website even if the wiki is behind a firewall. > > For more details, see  Please use for this issue.   > George Argyros and Aggelos Kiayias reported that the method used to generate > password reset tokens is not sufficiently secure. Instead we use various more > secure random number generators, depending on what is available on the > platform. Windows users are strongly advised to install either the openssl > extension or the mcrypt extension for PHP so that MediaWiki can take advantage > of the cryptographic random number facility provided by Windows. > > Any extension developers using mt_rand() to generate random numbers in contexts > where security is required are encouraged to instead make use of the > MWCryptRand class introduced with this release. > > For more details, see  Please use for this issue.   > A long-standing bug in the wikitext parser (bug was discovered to have > security implications. In the presence of the popular CharInsert extension, it > leads to cross-site scripting (XSS). XSS may be possible with other extensions > or perhaps even the MediaWiki core alone, although this is not confirmed at > this time. A denial-of-service attack (infinite loop) is also possible > regardless of configuration. > > For more details, see  Please use for this issue.   > Full release notes: > https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/gitweb?p=mediawiki/core.git;a=blob_plain;f=RE > > > > Co-inciding with these security releases, the MediaWiki source code > repository has > moved from SVN (at https://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/trunk/phase3) > to Git (https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/gitweb/mediawiki/core.git).

If you use > SVN checkouts of MediaWiki for version control, you need to migrate these to Git. > If you up are using tarballs, there should be no change in the process for you. > > Please note that any WMF-deployed extensions have also been migrated to Git > also, along with some other non WMF-maintained ones. > > Please bear with us, some of the Git related links for this release may not > work instantly, but should later on. > > To do a simple Git clone, the command is: > git clone https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/p/mediawiki/core.git > > More information is available at https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Git > > For more help, please visit the #mediawiki IRC channel on freenode.net > irc://irc.freenode.net/mediawiki or email The MediaWiki-l mailing list > at mediawiki-l at lists.wikimedia.org. > > > ********************************************************************** > Download: > > > Patch to previous version without interface text: > > Interface text changes: > > > GPG signatures: > > > > sig > > Public keys: > https://secure.wikimedia.org/keys.html > > > --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
