The position of the pgsql-jdbc project is that a client version should be used with a matching server version; therefore, the project views the proposed combination as an unsupported configuration.  Moreover, PostgreSQL 8.2.x and postgresql-jdbc-8.2-x were desupported in general as of December  The end of life dates for each major release are documented on our web site[1], and the pgsql-jdbc download site[2] clearly identifies this version of the driver as an "archived version" rather than a "supported version".  As a rule, bug fix and security updates are not released for versions which are no longer supported; users are advised to update to a supported version.  Users of pgsql-jdbc are further advised to use a major version that matches the PostgreSQL server to which they are connecting.
