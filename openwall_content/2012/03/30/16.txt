Do you realize that plenty of services that use crypt() - likely the majority of them, even - don't handle NULL returns, so they will segfault when these conditions are triggered?  (That's assuming there is no way for an attacker to get something mmap()'ed at NULL in the service.)  I think the NULL returns got into POSIX starting with if so, anything written earlier than that legitimately does not handle NULL returns (and indeed a lot of newer code also does not).  I have to admit that DragonFly BSD also recently went with NULL returns, and I failed to convince them to do otherwise.  NetBSD went with my suggestion of "*0" / "*1", though.
