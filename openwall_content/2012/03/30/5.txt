ID: Original advisory: http://www.waraxe.us/advisory-81.html Mailing list post:  """ Reason: failure to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input data Preconditions: privileges needed for picture keywords editing  Coppermine user with appropriate privileges is able to modify picture information:   There is a field in form named as "Keywords (separate with semicolon)". After insertion to database those keywords are later used in html meta section. It appears, that specific user supplied data is not properly validated before outputting as html to the end user, resulting in Stored XSS vulnerability.  Testing:  1. Open picture information editing page:   2. Insert XSS payload below as keywords and click "Apply changes":  "><body  After that issue request to view this image:   As result we can observe XSS payload execution. """  There is also four different path disclosure vulnerabilities (includes plugins), but I think one CVE-identifier for this advisory is enough as these are all in the same version and path disclosure is very low severity.  - Henri Salo  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
