When such an old version of postgresql-jdbc is used with a newer postgresql server it not only breaks when strings contain single quotes, it also allows for SQL injections[3]. The bug is neither in postgresql-jdbc as it was working correctly at the time it was released, nor is it really postgresql 9.1's fault which I guess doesn't expect and can't detect such an old jdbc adapter. The security issue arises when mixing the old adapter and the new server. One might be inclined to say this is not a security issue as it's likely to break during normal operation as soon as some string contains a single quote. But then isn't that the case for SQL injections in general?
