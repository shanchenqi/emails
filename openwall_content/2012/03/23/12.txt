This change made its way into their CVS first,  but it was actually meant to go in along with another change that is a  security fix and already has a CVE entry associated with it   If a Linux distribution picks up the fix for then they will  want to pick up change at the same time since the fix for the  security vulnerability will generally cause symmetric decryption errors  when it kicks in and things get very confusing for the end user without  change (they will frequently get junk results with a success return  value instead of an error return value).  Both were reported to OpenSSL at  the same time, but the CVE change was submitted later because it was more  complicated and required more review and discussion.  Hope that helps, -Ivan  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
