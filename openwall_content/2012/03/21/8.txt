From our understanding the researcher did test and not  Thanks Matt, and Edwin, for the prompt responses.  Hopefully the researcher will respond as promptly (it would definitely be good to know whether or not the current is still vulnerable).  Thanks again (especially for the bugzilla links in Edwin's message).  >On Wed, Mar 21, at PM, Vincent Danen <vdanen@...hat.com> wrote: > >    Hopefully security@ for ClamAV goes somewhere useful (I don't feel like >    opening a bugzilla account there just to ask this). > >    Saw a bunch of CVEs come through for various anti-virus products, five >    of which are reportedly applicable for ClamAV  I'm wondering a) >    if the upstream folks know about these and b) whether or not the report >    has a typo in the version, since is the latest upstream version? > >    > >    Indicates that >    and affect ClamAV  There isn't much >    more information though.
