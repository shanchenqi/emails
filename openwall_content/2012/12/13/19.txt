To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: pacemaker strcmp  Hi,  I might have overlooked something. Starting from Line 39, if pacemaker is compiled with ACL support:  https://github.com/ClusterLabs/pacemaker/blob/master/include/crm_internal.h#L39  Once a user root\0bar is created, and CRM_DAEMON_USER is #undef we can return TRUE. Haven't looked into further details here and I think no sane admin will ever allow such a user. What do you guys think?    /* For ACLs */ char *uid2username(uid_t uid); void determine_request_user(char *user, xmlNode * request, const char *field);  # if ENABLE_ACL # include <string.h> static inline gboolean is_privileged(const char *user) {     if (user == NULL) {         return FALSE;     } else if (strcmp(user, CRM_DAEMON_USER) == 0) { <------------- #undef ?         return TRUE;     } else if (strcmp(user, "root") == 0) { <------------------- err         return TRUE;     }     return FALSE; } # endif  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
