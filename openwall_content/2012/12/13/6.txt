The report is for geany, so for geany's filename escaping to actually be at fault, you would still have to load the offending file into the editor. Otherwise, just running 'make' from the command line would trigger the exact same effect, except that make is (as has been pointed out) designed to run arbitrary shell commands already and therefore won't be doing anything wrong.  > The difference when running it directly from the command line is > that Bash would escape those files for you, so even with crafted names > nothing bad / suspicious would happen (and project would build > if syntactically correct). >   Except that people wouldn't manually compile thousands of files one by one.

This is not a security issue that concerns geany.  --  Andreas Ericsson                   andreas.ericsson@....se OP5 AB                             www.op5.se Tel: +46                  Fax: +46  Considering the successes of the wars on alcohol, poverty, drugs and terror, I think we should give some serious thought to declaring war on peace.
