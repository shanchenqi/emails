Different office applications automatically include remote files on opening local files. Examples include MS Word [1] and LibreOffice/OpenOffice [2].  I can imagine different impacts:  - The origin of a document can track when a document has been opened and   possibly by whom.  - The origin of a document can arbitrarily change the displayed content   of the document whenever the document is opened (without affecting hash   sums of the document). For example, the origin may change the content   of a remote image depending on from which IP or when the image is   accessed. For example, a sent tender may be changed after the tender   deadline.  - Under certain conditions, remote content is directly embedded into   a document. This may allow to extract confidential data. For example,   LibreOffice/OpenOffice directly embed remote content when converting   a document into the PDF format. An attacker may send a document   referencing confidential data to a victim asking the victim to convert   the file. If the victim converts and sends the document back, the   attacker receives the confidential data.  In my opinion, these issues are a question of user expectation. Users are aware that web browsers may access remote content even when opening local files. I don't think users are aware that office application may do the same. An 'offline mode' for office applications that is enabled by default could meet user expectations.
