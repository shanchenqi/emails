That's where build systems come in.  Yes, and for manual compilation to even have a chance to work one would tweak a lot the build command to match the project's needs (inclusion paths, link paths, etc.), so one has to be told to do so.  So I don't think it's more problematic than telling an user to run say, "sudo cp -f that_file_I_sent_you /bin/sh".  Nobody can protect an user from that, only the user can do it.  >> To the difference, in the Geany scenario, the file name(s) would >> be passed to command line directly as they are (and if the project >> would build or not at the end isn't what matters here). >> >  > For the original report to be valid, the file would still have to > be loaded into geany, or the report should have been about some > other program. This is not a security issue that concerns geany.  All this said, I think the issue should still be addressed, because although it doesn't looks so security-related to me, it's not good to choke on quotes or whatever.  But that's not oss-security's problem :)  Regards, Colomban  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
