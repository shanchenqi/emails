CVE assigns different IDs when bugs are not present in the  same exact set of versions.  - use this, but only for the stack-based buffer overflow  that was fixed in 4.2.  - new ID for the other "large input" validation issues that  lead to the physical CPU hang, which were NOT fixed in 4.2.   - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
