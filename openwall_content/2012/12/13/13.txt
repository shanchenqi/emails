If anyone knows how to block external data in LibreOffice by default I'd love to know how.  I'm kind of leaning towards classifying this as a security issue since I expected there is some way to disable it or at least tell it to prompt me when a document tries to go get an external data source (e.g. "this document contains external data, the URLs/file paths it is trying to  reference are: [list of locations]") but apparently there is no way to disable/have this prompt (at least that I can find in LibreOffice)?  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  iQIcBAEBAgAGBQJQygXfAAoJEBYNRVNeJnmTFqIP/iJnABzsYiXPXcnMTFYJgtEe nxGHEWLWJbO8tGwnhmzo =iVPl -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
