I think your assessment is correct.  I've just now made an ODT file that libreoffice uses to not only hit the network for a PNG (denial of service attacks, remote exploitation of other flaws in libpng or in LO itself, virus scanner bypass, etc), but one that will include and render ~/.ssh/id_rsa as a text/plain document.  This seems like it could be done against any local privileged file.  For local file inclusion, libreoffice at leasts prompts me with:  -----------  This document contains one or more links to external data.   Would you like to change the document, and update all links to get the  most recent data?   [Yes] [No] -----------  but it doesn't tell me what those documents are. And given the UI history of people clicking through popups they don't understand, i'm not convinced that this popup is going to do anything to prevent remote disclosure (it even defaults to "Yes").  When i say "no" on the prompt, it goes out and fetches networked URLs anyway, so i assume this prompt is supposed to just refer to local "external data".  	--dkg  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
