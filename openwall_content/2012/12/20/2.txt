Could one be assigned? Thanks.   A vulnerability was reported in Zend Framework versions prior to and which can be exploited to disclose certain sensitive information.  This flaw is caused due to an error in the "Zend_Feed_Rss" and "Zend_Feed_Atom" classes of the "Zend_Feed" component, when processing XML data.  It can be used to disclose the contents of certain local files by sending specially crafted XML data including external entity references.
