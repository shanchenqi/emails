Successful exploits may allow unauthenticated attackers to construct specially crafted messages that can be successfully verified and contain arbitrary content.  This may lead to authentication bypass. _______________________________________________________________________ Details: Due to a bad use of Lasso library, SAML signatures are never checked, even if SP forces signature check. ____________________________________________________________________ CVSS Version 2 Metrics: Access Vector: Network exploitable Access Complexity: Low Authentication: Not required to exploit Impact Type:Allows unauthorized disclosure of information; Allows unauthorized modification _______________________________________________________________________ Disclosure Timeline: Vendor contacted Vendor: fixed issue in svn assigned Public advisory EoW _______________________________________________________________________ References: _______________________________________________________________________ Frédéric Basse - Thales Communications & Security -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org/  FUrKEesHvKJetICPCqsiMuJiCstedEvgdGhkMhrDqaEkZTDkvbaZysxuJ3JSQ6Pq =IgwQ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
