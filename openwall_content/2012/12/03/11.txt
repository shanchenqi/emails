ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The handler for XENMEM_exchange accesses guest memory without range checking the guest provided addresses, thus allowing these accesses to include the hypervisor reserved range.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest administrator can cause Xen to crash.  If the out of address space bounds access does not lead to a crash, a carefully crafted privilege escalation cannot be excluded, even though the guest doesn't itself control the values written.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen versions are vulnerable.  The vulnerability is only exposed to PV guests.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only HVM guests, or ensuring that PV guests only use trusted kernels, will avoid this vulnerability.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.
