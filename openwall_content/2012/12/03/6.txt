ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Downgrading the grant table version of a guest involves freeing its status pages. This freeing was incomplete - the page(s) are freed back to the allocator, but not removed from the domain's tracking list. This would cause list corruption, eventually leading to a hypervisor crash.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest administrator can cause Xen to crash, leading to a denial of service attack.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen version from 4.0 on are vulnerable.  Version 3.4 and earlier are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only guests with trusted kernels will avoid this vulnerability.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.
