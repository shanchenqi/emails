ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Allowing arbitrary extent_order input values for XENMEM_decrease_reservation, XENMEM_populate_physmap, and XENMEM_exchange can cause arbitrarily long time being spent in loops without allowing vital other code to get a chance to execute. This may also cause inconsistent state resulting at the completion of these hypercalls.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest administrator can cause Xen to hang.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen versions are vulnerable.  However, older versions (not supporting Populate-on-Demand, i.e. before 3.4) may only be theoretically affected.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only trusted guest kernels will avoid this vulnerability.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.
