ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The function get_page_from_gfn does not validate its input GFN. An invalid GFN passed to a hypercall which uses this function will cause the hypervisor to read off the end of the frame table and potentially crash.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest administrator of a PV guest can cause Xen to crash. If the out of bounds access does not lead to a crash, a carefully crafted privilege escalation cannot be excluded, even though the guest doesn't itself control the values written.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Only Xen 4.2 and Xen unstable are vulnerable. Xen 4.1 and earlier are not vulnerable.  The vulnerability is exposed only to PV guests.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only trusted PV guest kernels will avoid this vulnerability.  Running only HVM guests will avoid this vulnerability.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.
