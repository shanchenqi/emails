At best,  we will probably describe to emphasis the sysadmin's role.  Just to toss a droplet of esoteric commentary into the bloodbath - while I  generally agree with the belief that distinct privileges should imply  boundaries that can not be broken, the reality is that most privilege  models are not well-documented or well-understood, and some privileges  might (by design) be effectively equivalent.  So, privilege issues aren't  necessarily guaranteed to be treated as vulnerabilities if they don't  violate the intended security policy.  There was some discussion about  this kind of challenge in the Linux kernel on oss-security a while back  that makes my head hurt just thinking about it.  >> * MySQL Remote Preauth User Enumeration Zeroday >> >> > > This is hardly a "zeroday" issue, it was known for, like, ten years.
