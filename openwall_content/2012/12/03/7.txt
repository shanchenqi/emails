ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The HVMOP_set_mem_access operation handler uses an input as an array index before range checking it.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest administrator can cause Xen to crash.  If the out of array bounds access does not crash, the arbitrary value read will be used if the caller reads back the default access through the HVMOP_get_mem_access operation, thus causing an information leak. The caller cannot, however, directly control the address from which to read, since the value read in the first step will be used as an array index again in the second step.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Only Xen version 4.1 is vulnerable.  The vulnerability is only exposed to HVM guests.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only PV guests, or ensuring that the controlling domain of HVM guests (e.g. dom0 or stubdom) only uses trusted code, will avoid this vulnerability.  RESOLUTION ==========  The attached patch resolves this issue.   $ xsa28*.patch  $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =GkYq -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
