Background =============  Bogofilter is a software package for classifying a message as spam or non-spam.  It uses a data base to store words and must be trained which messages are spam and non-spam. It uses the probabilities of individual words for classifying the message.  Note that the bogofilter project is issuing security announcements only for current "stable" releases, and not necessarily for past "stable" releases.  2. Problem description ======================  Julius Plenz figured out that bogofilter's/bogolexer's base64 could overwrite heap memory in the character set conversion in certain pathological cases of invalid base64 code that decodes to incomplete multibyte characters.  3. Impact =========  Vulnerable bogofilter/bogolexer applications can corrupt their heap and crash.  4. Solution ===========  Upgrade your bogofilter to version (or a newer release).  bogofilter is available from SourceForge:   A.
