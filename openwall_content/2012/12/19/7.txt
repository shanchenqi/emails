We don't know what vendors are basing their UEFI bios implementation on the open source version, I know there is at least one UEFI bios that is not based on the open source version, or so it is reported (the BSD license of Tianocore means that we will never really know.)  Determining what machine is running what bios from what company that was based on what version of the open source UEFI implementation is going to be a huge problem in the long run and something that I sure don't want to have to track.  There have been reported bugs in the Tianocore in the past, I don't think they were "security" issues in and of themselves, should we be reporting them here to get CVE numbers if they are?  thanks,  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
