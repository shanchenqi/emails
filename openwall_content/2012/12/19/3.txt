Not that I know of, all of the "public" ones are based on Matthew Gerritt's code, do you know of another one that has made it through the Microsoft signing process?  > The Fedora 18 TC3 installer boots on the machine mentioned above, in > the factory default configuration.

Also, there is a bug in Matthew's signed shim code that fails on some machines (like the one I have), so you might want to work on getting the bugfix into your build/sign/distro creation process.  But, more on-topic, how does UEFI secure boot have anything to do with this mailing list?  thanks,  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
