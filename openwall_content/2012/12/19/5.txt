That's correct. has been assigned to the perl XML-Atom issue.  Assuming the source of the slight confusion is this comment:  and the CVE id in the references.  But from the context of that bug, comment c#13 was used just to reference patch for same issue in perl XML-Atom issue, when searching a patch for inkscape.  Which later resulted into upstream inkscape commit:  referenced in (subsequent) comment c#14:  So identifier is for perl XML-Atom problem. And this (same XXE problem) being present in inkscape should get a new CVE id yet.
