I was mistaken, I assumed that Fedora was shipping Matthew's 0.1 code,  which differs significantly from the 0.2 code.  But it turns out that  Fedora ships 0.2 instead (since the end of November).

Yes, or the UEFI implementation on the box is buggy.  It could not boot  the installer before, but now it can.  > But, more on-topic, how does UEFI secure boot have anything to do with > this mailing list?  Aren't vendors basing their implementation on the open-source code from  Intel?  Or are you referring to the fact that Secure Boot has little to  do with security?  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
