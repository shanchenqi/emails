I am merging these issues into a single CVE, same researcher, same version of Linux kernel, basically same problem. If anyone objects strongly however I can split (assumption being the CVE assigned now would be for the Dec 3 issue). So we have:  ========================== Dec 3  +/* this is the size past which hardware will drop packets when setting LPE=0 */ +#define MAXIMUM_ETHERNET_VLAN_SIZE +    /* Discard oversized packets if !LPE and !SBP. */  ========================== Dec 5  +/* this is the size past which hardware will drop packets when setting LPE=1 */ +#define MAXIMUM_ETHERNET_LPE_SIZE  ==========================  Please use for these issues.   > Thanks, >  > /mjt >  > Michael Tokarev wrote: >> qemu-1.3 includes the following patch by Michael Contreras: >>  >> (initial >> submission) >>  >> >> >> >>  (the commit) >>  >>  >> commit Author: Michael >> Contreras <michael@...tric.com> Date:   Sun Dec 2 >> Subject: Discard packets that are too long if !SBP >> and !LPE >>  >> The function for the needs to discard >> packets longer than bytes if the SBP and LPE flags are >> disabled.
