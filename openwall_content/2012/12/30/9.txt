One random thought, might it be worth adding structured data to CVE that basically says when the issue was made public/reported to the upstream and when upstream 1) acknowledged it (if ever) and then they patched it (if ever) and when they shipped a fixed version (if ever). Obviously then you could simply parse for the time between date reported and date acknowledged/patched/fixed and see how healthy/responsive the upstream is.   - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =DTEx -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
