Does someone have a working payload for this? References:   Until someone provides a working PoC I dispute this issue. SMF hasn't replied to my emails about this. Please note there is several comments[1][2] in forums about this too.  1: 2:  It's not a security vulnerability if attacker already has administrator access to the application. Should we REJECT  - Henri Salo  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
