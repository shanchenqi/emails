One thing I'm really noticing as a good rule of thumb:  1) if a project has security@ or similar email and responds timely, this is good. 2) if a project has security@ or similar email and never responds then they tend to fix things but not overly quickly/consistently 3) if a project has no security@ or similar email chances are they don't handle security issues very gracefully (big surprise hey).  Basically if the first result in Google for "report security issue to X" isn't useful chances are it's not going to end well. The best part is not all vendors provide a secure means to submit vulnerabilities (e.g. please provide a PGP encryption key for email, and if you use a web form please use HTTPS!).  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  lUkiKelZDWZYCFb7ESF/ =6Z7z -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
