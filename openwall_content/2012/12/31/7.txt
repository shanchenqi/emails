It is just used to decide what action should be taken. Relevant code involved: These are the only instances of "scheduled" in the entire codebase (the code is from the future SMF 2.1 version, but it didn't change from 2.0).  Kindred answer (comment [1]) is not relevant. He was probably referring to another bug we fixed with the latest patch  1:  > While it doesn't directly impact treatment of this latest report, I'd > like to point out that there has been a previous report by the same > author on the same product back in october, which I was also unable to > reproduce: > >    [...] > >    And again the "view" is only used to decide the action, but it is not used to produce any output.
