Should we REJECT  Based on the authors' description it would seem more likely that the attack would use social engineering to trick the legitimate forum admin into accessing this URL with a payload in it, which would then trigger in his browser and disclose the admins' session cookie to an attacker by means of cross site scripting. Like you, I don't see how the value passed to the "scheduled" parameter would be echoed out, though.  While it doesn't directly impact treatment of this latest report, I'd like to point out that there has been a previous report by the same author on the same product back in october, which I was also unable to reproduce:  From:    irist.ir@...il.com To:      bugtraq@...urityfocus.com Date:    Tue, 23 Oct GMT Subject: Smf Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability  # Exploit Title : Smf Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability # # Author        : IrIsT.Ir # # Discovered By : Am!r    Same for a supposed vulnerability in Wordpress which was reported the day after:  From:    irist.ir@...il.com To:      bugtraq@...urityfocus.com Subject: Wordpress 3.4 Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability  # Exploit Title : Wordpress 3.4 Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability # # Author        : IrIsT.Ir # # Discovered By : Am!r    I contacted the sender address back then, pointing out that:  > it's an XSS if the application returns the input in an unencoded way, > allowing an attacker (or victim) to inject script code into the > applications output. I don't see how this is the case with the SMF or > Wordpress code you quoted.  I have not received a reply.
