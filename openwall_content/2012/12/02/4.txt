MySQL manual specifies many times very explicitly:  ===    * Do not grant the `FILE' privilege to nonadministrative users. Any      user that has this privilege can write a file anywhere in the file      system with the privileges of the *Note `mysqld': mysqld. daemon.      To make this a bit safer, files generated with *Note `SELECT ...      INTO OUTFILE': select. do not overwrite existing files and are      writable by everyone.       The `FILE' privilege may also be used to read any file that is      world-readable or accessible to the Unix user that the server runs      as. With this privilege, you can read any file into a database      table. This could be abused, for example, by using *Note `LOAD      DATA': load-data. to load `/etc/passwd' into a table, which then      can be displayed with *Note `SELECT': select. === You should exercise particular caution in granting the `FILE' and administrative privileges:     * The `FILE' privilege can be abused to read into a database table      any files that the MySQL server can read on the server host. This      includes all world-readable files and files in the server's data      directory.  The table can then be accessed using *Note `SELECT':      select. to transfer its contents to the client host. ===  Additionally, MySQL (and MariaDB) provides a --secure-file-priv option that allows to restrict all FILE operations to a specific directory.  Thus, is not a bug, but a result of a misconfiguration, much like an anonymous ftp upload access to the $HOME of the ftp user.  > * MySQL Denial of Service Zeroday PoC > >  Acknowledged.  > * MySQL Remote Preauth User Enumeration Zeroday > >  This is hardly a "zeroday" issue, it was known for, like, ten years. But I'll see what we can do here.
