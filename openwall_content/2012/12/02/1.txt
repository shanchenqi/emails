However in this case we have a bit of a time constraint (it's a weekend and this is blowing up quickly)  and the impacts are potentially quite severe. So I've spoken with some other Red Hat SRT members and we feel it is best to get CVE #'s assigned for these issues quickly so we can refer to them properly.  If Oracle security has already assigned CVE's for these please let us and the public know so we can use the correct numbers. Also if Oracle can let the public know which versions of MySQL are affected (e.g. 5.0.x, 5.1.x, 5.5.x, etc.) that would be very helpful to everyone I am sure.  I am also adding MySQL, Oracle, MariaDB, OSS-SEC, Steven Christey, cve-assign and OSVDB to the CC so that everyone is aware of what is going on.   - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  fa9hdUARqamhayQbkNdH =sXhV -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
