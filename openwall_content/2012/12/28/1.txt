Also if you need CVE's for Jenkins (or any other major Open Source project your participate in, this goes for everyone) in future contact me and they can be assigned prior to advisory release which makes life easier for everyone.

From:   The first vulnerability is commonly known as HTTP response splitting vulnerability, which can act as a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This allows an anonymous attacker to inject malicious HTMLs to pages served by Jenkins. This in turn allows an attacker to escalate his privileges by hijacking sessions of other users. To mount this attack, the attacker needs to know the exact URL of your Jenkins installation. This vulnerability affects those who run Jenkins on its built-in servlet container (this includes all the native packages.)  Please use for this issue.  The second vulnerability is so-called open redirect vulnerability. This allows an anonymous attacker to create an URL that looks as if it's pointing to Jenkins, yet it actually lands on the site that the attacker controls. This can be therefore used as a basis for phishing.  Please use for this issue.  The third vulnerability is a cross-site scripting vulnerability that allows an attacker with some degree of write access in Jenkins to embed malicious JavaScript into pages generated by Jenkins.  Please use for this issue.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with undefined - http://www.enigmail.net/  =+kWZ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
