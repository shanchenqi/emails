Cache allows directory listing of hash-key listings, exposing hash keys.  2. Hash keys are easily predictable, in the case of (1) not existing.  3. Cached database values are downloadable by their hash keys on the public internet, exposing sensitive information like password hashes.  Fixing (3) mitigates (1) and (2), so assign this either three CVEs or one CVE.  Source:  The vendor, copied on this email, currently has not issued a fix.  Thanks, Jason   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
