One of our guys has had a chance to look into this:   Petr Pisar EST  Created attachment [details] Template for reproducer  Could show the attack vector? Attached is small code showing how to use Locale::Maketext. Please modify it to explain the vulnerability.  I think the vulnerability is effective only when attacker has first argument of maketext() under control.  However that means the attacker can run any code even without this `vulnerability'. It's like saying glibc's gettext() is vulnerable. But that's not true.  Sure gettext("%s", user_input) is not safe, but this is flaw in the caller, not in the gettext. The same applies to Locale::Maketext::maketext().  Petr Pisar EST  And actually the patch breaks behaviour because it forbids cross-package calls which were explicitly allowed and documented before. I disbelieve the patch is good candidate for stable distributions.   - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =ITgy -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
