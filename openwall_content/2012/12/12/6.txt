The information is not yet public in all of the cases, and can potentially affect the number of CVEs assigned. For now, we would prefer that other CNAs allow MITRE to assign CVEs that are related to:    - behavior of Locale::Maketext itself    - security issues in use of Locale::Maketext by Perl-based products    - security announcements from vendors who are attempting to work     around a real or perceived Locale::Maketext issue  We'll try to get the full set of CVE IDs sent here as soon as possible.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =Xkmr -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
