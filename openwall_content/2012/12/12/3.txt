Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: Due to Nagios (core) history.cgi crash  post)  Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,    based on:   [1]  we have investigated the situation for potential security implications and it looks on distributions, with FORTIFY_SOURCE protection enabled, this problem would not be a security flaw (the history.cgi plug-in truly crashes, but main Nagios daemon stays alive and the overflow is detected / in httpd error log:  *** buffer overflow detected ***: /usr/lib64/nagios/cgi-bin/history.cgi terminated )  So on distributions with F_S enabled the only impact would be 'nagios' executable crash, but since it's just 'history.cgi' plug-in which crashes, DoS can't be reached here either.  Based on the above, we would not consider this to be a security flaw, but mentioning here for case nagios is shipped without F_S protection somewhere (in that case it might be more interesting from security point of view and might qualify for a CVE id).  Thank you && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
