Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,    Background: Geany is a small and fast integrated development enviroment with basic features and few dependencies to other packages or Desktop Environments.  Based on (you might need to click 'Yes, I agree' OK to get the exploit code in [2]): [1] [2]  it was found that Geany is not escaping filenames (when compiling / building source) prior passing the final command line to shell.  The questions: 1) should Geany escape the filenames?, 2) is this a security issue or not?  Two views: * view #1 - it shouldn't escape the filenames. It's just IDE, so what it obtains as input is passed to shell for execution.  * view #2 - it should escape the filenames (because this is what shell / bash is doing) prior making the build.  Obviously, even for gcc you can pass specially-crafted filename, when attempt to build it would lead to "ls -la" command (for example) to be executed.  I by myself am not sure / not able to decide here.  Steve, could you hint? Does Mitre have some guidance / document, how to deal with cases like this one?  Thank you && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team  P.S.: Cc-ed Geany maintainers for their opinion too.
