Most signed Linux boot loaders only verify the kernel (and,  indirectly, code that's loaded into the kernel), but not the initrd  contents.  (This isn't possible because initrds are system-specific and  thus cannot be signed in general.  Recovery images signed by system  manufactures likely have similar issues.)  As a result, the signed  loader might start something that wipes the hard disk or uploads its  contents somewhere  I'm wondering if this is a problem.  I haven't investigated boot order  defaults for legacy systems, so I don't know if this plug-and-wipe issue  is a regression.  In the end, this boils down to what Secure Boot means,  semantically.  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
