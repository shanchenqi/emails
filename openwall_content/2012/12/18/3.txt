UEFI Secure Boot really doesn't care about the kernel or the OS at all, all it is there for is to protect the bootloader and the BIOS.  The fact that some operating systems take that chain-of-trust and extend it beyond the BIOS is up to them, and the fact that some UEFI signing authorities might impose more restrictions on the binaries that they sign is also up to them, and not part of the UEFI specification or requirements.  Having a signed USB image boot properly if it is installed seems to be the correct thing to me, but, in my testing, has not been the default on the hardware that I have access to.  It would be great to find out what hardware you are seeing this on as I am helping to get Linux working properly on UEFI machines these days.  thanks,  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
