In other words an attack over the > local network resulting in a DoS condition.  Well, an attacker that is allowed to send RA's could do all kinds of ugly things, just like a rogue DHCP server could. Since that kind of address configuration provides no means to verify authenticity, hosts have no way to tell whether an RA is correct or malicious. Security basically relies on the switches blocking unintended address configuration.  cu Ludwig  --   (o_   Ludwig Nussel  //\  V_/_  http://www.suse.de/ SUSE LINUX Products GmbH, GF: Jeff Hawn, Jennifer Guild, Felix ImendĂśrffer, HRB (AG NĂźrnberg)   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
