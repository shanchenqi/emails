Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE request: Mysql/Mariadb insecure salt-usage  Hi,  Noticed another post by kingcope on full-disclosure, which basically boils down to re-use of a salt-value when transmitting passwords over a network.  If you could MITM/capture network packets, you could use this weakness to determine the passwords.
