It was not single issue, but more like two separate issues. Most importantly this leads to patch listed to fix only part of the problems described. Something like:  A denial of service flaw was found in the way the server component of Freeciv, a turn-based, multi-player, X based strategy game, processed certain packets (invalid packets with whole packet length lower than packet header size). A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted packet that, when processed would lead to freeciv server to terminate (due to memory exhaustion)   The other half: A denial of service flaw was found in the way the server component of Freeciv, a turn-based, multi-player, X based strategy game, processed certain packets (syntactically valid packets, but whose processing would lead to an infinite loop). A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted packet that, when processed would lead to freeciv server to become unresponsive (due to excessive CPU use).  is fixed in     Both are fixed in (and patch versions applied to the stable branch S2_3 release was made from: , )    - ML  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
