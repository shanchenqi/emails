Paul, I've included you on Cc: to help determine if several grep patches are security-relevant.  A bug reporter [1] that claims he has, or can produce, a code execution exploit against grep < I've verified that our grep package segfaults on the amd64 platform with the simple reproducer:  $ perl -e 'print | grep x > /dev/null Segmentation fault (core dumped)  This specific problem was patched [2] with the following checkin:  This checkin adds this text to the NEWS file:  + grep no longer dumps core on lines whose lengths do not fit in 'int'. + (e.g., lines longer than 2 GiB on a typical 64-bit host). + Instead, grep either works as expected, or reports an error. + An error can occur if not enough main memory is available, or if the + GNU C library's regular expression functions cannot handle such long lines. + [bug present since "the beginning"]  Please assign a CVE number for this problem.   Several other checkins around the timeframe also look like they may be security-relevant:  PCRE over-long line fix:  Integer overflow issues:  Paul, are any security issues fixed with those patches? Did I overlook any other patches that need CVE numbers?
