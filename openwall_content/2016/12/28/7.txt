To exploit the vulnerability an attacker could target common website components such as contact/feedback forms, registration forms, password email resets and others that send out emails with the help of a vulnerable version of the SwiftMailer class.  Despite the significant efforts in responsibly disclosing the vulnerability to the vendor (since 2nd December). The vulnerability remains unfixed as of 28 December.
