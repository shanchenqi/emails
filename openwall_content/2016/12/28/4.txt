This was reported responsibly to the vendor & assigned a CVEID on the 26th of December. The vendor has been working on a new patch which would fix the problem but not break the RFC too badly. The patch should be published very soon.  I'm releasing this as a 0day without the new patch available publicly as a potential bypass was publicly discussed on oss-sec with Solar Designer in the PHPMailer < thread, so holding the advisory further would serve no purpose.   Current advisory URL:   More updates soon at:  https://twitter.com/dawid_golunski   --  Regards, Dawid Golunski https://legalhackers.com t: @dawid_golunski  View attachment "PHPMailer-fix-bypass.txt" of type "text/plain" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
