The bug occurs when the conversion outputs more than bytes.  The flaw happens because the floating point conversion is using system functions without the correct boundary checks.  The functions have been documented as deprecated for a long time and users are discouraged from using them in "new programs" as they are planned to get removed at a future point. But as the functions are present and there's nothing preventing users from using them, we expect there to be a certain amount of existing users in the wild.  If there are any application that accepts a format string from the outside without necessary input filtering, it could allow remote attacks.  This flaw does not exist in the command line tool.  We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.  INFO ----  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name to this issue.  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  This flaw exists in the following libcurl versions.  - Affected versions: libcurl 7.1 to and including - Not affected versions: libcurl >=  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!  THE SOLUTION ------------  In version the conversion is limited to never generate a larger output than what fits in the fixed size buffer.  A [patch for is available.  RECOMMENDATIONS ---------------  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:    A - Upgrade curl and libcurl to version    B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild    C - Do not use the `curl_mprintf()` functions  TIME LINE ---------  It was first reported to the curl project on November 8 by Daniel Stenberg.  We contacted distros@...nwall on December 13.  curl was released on December 21 coordinated with the publication of this advisory.
