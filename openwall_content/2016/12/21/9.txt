All programs in /usr/local/vesta/bin/ directory can therefore be run as root. A command injection vulnerability in "v-get-web-domain-value" script can be exploited to run arbitrary commands and escalate from admin user to root.  Vulnerability: Parameter $3 (key) in v-get-web-domain-value is not properly sanitized before being passed to bash eval.  GitHub issue: GitHub fix commit:  Fix: Remove "v-get-web-domain-value" script file, because it is not used anymore.
