The first item I found in about one minute of inspection is that they include an utterly ancient version of ffmpeg:  https://github.com/ericpaulbishop/gargoyle/blob/master/package/ffmpeg/Makefile#L10  PKG_NAME:=ffmpeg PKG_RELEASE:=1  PKG_SOURCE:=$(PKG_NAME)-$(PKG_VERSION).tar.bz2 PKG_SOURCE_URL:=http://ffmpeg.org/releases/  The 2.4 branch of ffmpeg ended with version on Not only are they nine point releases behind, they are also drastically behind on shipping newer versions entirely. (The latest version upstream is numbered That's seven minor versions behind, too.) Granted, new versions bring new bugs, but picking one point in time two years ago and then never updating is trouble.  I didn't spot any security fixes for ffmpeg in the patches-generic or patches-old directories, but perhaps they just weren't clearly labeled.  Another concerning point is the use of md5 to validate the download. While use of md5 as a 'better crc32' is well established, most cryptographic authorities are saying it's time to replace md5's replacement, sha-1. They're two hash functions behind the times.  A full review would take far more time than I have to offer but the initial impression is that it needs a serious refresh of its dependencies.
