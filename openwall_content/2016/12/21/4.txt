Hi my name is Jonathan. I don't know if this is the write place to ask  about this but here gos.  I would like to know if any one would like to have a poke around at the  third party router firmware I use on my router called Gargoyle. Its a easy to use interface built on top of Openwrt.  I use this firmware because it has some grate plug ins and the user  interface has grate a11y. I use a screen reader as I am blind and the  html5 interface is easy for me to get around in.  It's homepage https://www.gargoyle-router.com/index.php GitHub https://github.com/ericpaulbishop/gargoyle forum https://www.gargoyle-router.com/phpbb/index.php  The devs behind Gargoyle are really nice people and have helped me out  with bugs and made me a mod on the forum. What I would really like to know is just how secure is this firmware?  I'm not a coder. I am just interested in how safe is my router firmware  keeping me?  If any one finds any sacurety bugs I know they will get fix.  Thanks and sorry about my spelling Jonathan				  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
