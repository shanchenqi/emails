We did make an unreleased fix (Mercurial changeset  and earlier changeset but perhaps not the way you  like.  The fix which was made was to require that the embedded JPEG  data has the same dimensions as the containing JNG file.  The existing  resource limit mechanism would then allow the user to constrain the  size of the JNG image.  The default constraints in a 64-bit build are  larger than what the JPEG format supports.  It does not seem correct to change the default limits of the software  in order to make fuzzing easier.
