Both were discovered by Paul Szabo.    * Privilege escalation when upgrading tomcat8 package          > Having installed tomcat8, the directory /etc/tomcat8/Catalina is     > set writable by group tomcat8, as per the postinst script. Then     > the tomcat8 user, in the situation envisaged in and     > see also     > could use something like commands     >      >   mv -i /etc/tomcat8/Catalina/localhost /tmp     >   ln -s /etc/shadow /etc/tomcat8/Catalina/localhost     >      > to create a symlink.     >      > Then when the tomcat8 package is upgraded (e.g. for the next DSA),     > the postinst script runs     >      >   chmod /etc/tomcat8/Catalina /etc/tomcat8/Catalina/localhost     >      > and that will make the /etc/shadow file world-readable (and     > group-writable). Other useful attacks might be to make the     > objects:     >      >   /root/.Xauthority     >   /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key     >      > world-readable; or make something (already owned by group tomcat8)     > group-writable (some "policy" setting maybe?).    * Privilege escalation when removing tomcat8 package          > Having installed tomcat8, the directory /etc/tomcat8/Catalina is     > set writable by group tomcat8, as per the postinst script. Then     > the tomcat8 user, in the situation envisaged in and     > see also     > could use something like commands     >     >  # touch /etc/tomcat8/Catalina/attack     >  # chmod /etc/tomcat8/Catalina/attack     >     > to create a file.     >     > Then if the tomcat8 package is removed (purged?), the postrm     > script runs      >      >  chown -Rhf root:root /etc/tomcat8/     >     > and that will leave the file world-writable, setgid root:      >     > # ls -l /etc/tomcat8/Catalina/attack     > -rwxr-Srwx 1 root root 0 Nov 23 /etc/tomcat8/Catalina/attack     >     > allowing "group root" access to the world.
