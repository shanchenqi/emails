This issue could result in a crash after starting tcsh and hitting TAB on some systems.  Right now, the issue is contained in Fedora/RHEL, because we're using glibc's sysmalloc (not the builtin malloc), which masks the issue. Fedora maintainer decided to fix this anyway just to be safe. As far as our systems are concerned we don't consider this a security issue for now. I am looking forward to hearing other opinions if anyone is interested.
