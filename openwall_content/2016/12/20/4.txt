This front-end contained a Command Injection vulnerability in a RSS feed reader class that loads (via insecure clear-text HTTP or HTTPS accepting self-signed certificates) the latest Nagios news from a remote RSS feed (located on the vendor's server on the Internet) upon log-in to the Nagios front-end. The vulnerability could potentially enable remote unauthenticated attackers who  managed to impersonate the feed server (via DNS poisoning, domain hijacking etc.), to provide a malicious response that injects parameters to curl command used by the affected RSS client class and effectively read/write arbitrary files on the vulnerable Nagios server. This could lead to Remote Code Execution in the context of www-data/nagios user on default Nagios installs that follow the official setup guidelines.  The full up-to-date advisory and a PoC exploit can be found at:   A copy of the current advisory has also been attached to this message.  Video PoC:    Attackers who have successfully exploited this vulnerability and achieved code execution with 'nagios' group privileges, could escalate their privileges to root system account via another Nagios vulnerability described at:   For updates, follow:  https://twitter.com/dawid_golunski   -- Regards, Dawid Golunski https://legalhackers.com t: @dawid_golunski  View attachment "Nagios-Command-Injection.txt" of type "text/plain" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
