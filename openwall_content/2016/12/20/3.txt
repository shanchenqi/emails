I am hereby requesting CVE identifiers for the following (20) issues.  It is unclear why upstream hasn't requested those themselves, but I assume, given the time since those issues were discovered, that they will not proceed with requests themselves and there should be no duplicates here. The Debian security team is very dilligent in handling CVEs and if there were identifiers already issued for those issues, they would have been sorted out already.  I include the Debian bug numbers, the upstream commit and, when possible, the upstream issue where more discussions sometimes took place. I also include a Debian-specific reference URL that we use internally to keep track of the issue which shows which versions of Debian are fixed and other notes. Some issues also include when the issue was fixed upstream in cases where it was obvious in the commitlog or Debian release process.  All commits are on the Imagemagick 7 and generally have a counterpart on the 6 branch, available in Debian or upstream, unless otherwise noted.  It is the first time I request a large number of CVE identifiers. I have tried to provide as much details as I could. Given the amount of information actually available upstream, this has proven to be difficult. I hope the format is acceptable and the information sufficient, I would welcome any feedback as to how to improve this process.  I would also like to remind the list that the following request is still pending CVE IDs:  Thanks in advance.  Off-by-one count when parsing an 8BIM profile =============================================  Debian bug: Reference URL: Upstream commit: N/A Upsteram issue: N/A Upstream version fixed:  I could not find which exact commit patched this specific vulnerability.
