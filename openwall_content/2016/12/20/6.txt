By stripping the "starttls" feature from the server response with a man-in-the-middle tool, an attacker can force the client to authenticate in clear text even if the "SecurityMode.required" TLS setting has been set. This is a race condition issue so the attack will work after a few tries.  The vulnerability affects at least all 4.1.x versions and is fixed in Smack  References: https://github.com/igniterealtime/Smack/commit/ https://github.com/igniterealtime/Smack/commit/  Could you assign a CVE for this?
