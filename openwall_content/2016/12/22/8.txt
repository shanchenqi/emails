Jonathan,  - My suggestion is to port scan all devices eg routers you own. Then store and analyse the results. Only scan devices you own since scanning other peoples devices / networks may be illegal.  - A wide variety of tutorials and information about port scanning is available online.  - I found through port scanning some of the devices I own earlier this year, that there were many open and filtered ports and stated services such as telnet, upnp, and ssdp. I found out via research that these services / protocols have had vulnerabilities in the past that are publicly known. There are likely many devices with known and unknown weaknesses in circulation.  - shodan.io can tell one how many requests are being sent by specific services / protocols. Some results were quite surprising to me.  Q: Does anyone know if there are databases / listings / websites that have port scan results by device? If yes, some examples would be good.

To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com, oss-security@...ts.openwall.com  Date: Wednesday, December 21, AM        Hi my name is  Jonathan. I don't know if this is the write place to ask   about this but here gos.    I would like to know if any one would like to have a poke  around at the   third party router firmware I use on my router called  Gargoyle.  Its a easy to use interface built on top of Openwrt.    I use this firmware because it has some grate plug ins and  the user   interface has grate a11y. I use a screen reader as I am  blind and the   html5 interface is easy for me to get around in.    It's homepage  https://www.gargoyle-router.com/index.php  GitHub  https://github.com/ericpaulbishop/gargoyle  forum  https://www.gargoyle-router.com/phpbb/index.php    The devs behind Gargoyle are really nice people and have  helped me out   with bugs and made me a mod on the forum.  What I would really like to know is just how secure is this  firmware?    I'm not a coder. I am just interested in how safe is my  router firmware   keeping me?    If any one finds any sacurety bugs I know they will get  fix.    Thanks and sorry about my spelling  Jonathan                     Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
