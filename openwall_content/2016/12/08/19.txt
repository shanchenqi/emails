The affected code is in Linux down to 2.6.something (problem might require splice() to be exploitable).  Linus has committed a fix for this to mainline:  commit Author: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@...ux-foundation.org> Date:   Tue Dec 6      Don't feed anything but regular iovec's to blk_rq_map_user_iov      In theory we could map other things, but there's a reason that function     is called "user_iov".  Using anything else (like splice can do) just     confuses it.
