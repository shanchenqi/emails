Invalid memory read in flx_decode_chunks (gst-plugins-good) The fix is a larger rewrite of the affected code paths and probably fixed a bunch of other issues on the way. It also fixes the second flic bug reported by Chris Evans described here:  one byte heap off by one read in (gst-plugins-bad)  Invalid memory read in glib caused by one invalid unref call in the flxdec decoder. (gst-plugins-good)  4 byte heap out of bounds read in windows_icon_typefind (gst-plugins-base)  2 byte heap out of bounds read in gst_mpegts_section_new (gst-plugins-bad).  null pointer deref (segfault) in mpegts decoder / _parse_pat (gst-plugins-bad)  A note about the memory access bugs: glib's slice allocator can hide them, so finding them with asan sometimes only works if one sets G_SLICE=always-malloc   Stuff that's probably not security relevant:  Asserts / traps only:  decoder assert (gst-plugins-bad)  avidemux trap on invalid utf-8    The gstreamer devs were very quick in fixing all issues. The release should contain all the fixes.   --  Hanno Bรถck https://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
