Thanks.  Description: libming is a Flash (SWF) output library. It can be used from PHP, Perl, Ruby,  Python, C, C++, Java, and probably more on the way..  A fuzzing revealed an overflow in listswf. The bug does not reside in any  shared object but if you have a web application that calls directly the  listswf binary to parse untrusted swf, then you are affected.  The complete ASan output:  # listswf $FILE header indicates a filesize of but filesize is File version: 6 File size: Frame size: Frame rate: / sec.
