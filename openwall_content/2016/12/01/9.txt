Thanks.  Description: Graphicsmagick is an Image Processing System.  This is an old memory failure, discovered time ago. The maintainer, Mr. Bob  Friesenhahn was able to reproduce the issue; Iâm quoting his feedback about:  The problem is that the embedded JPEG data claims to have dimensions  and this is only learned after we are in the JPEG reader.  But for some reasons (maybe not easy to fix) it is still not fixed.  The complete ASan output:  # gm identify $FILE AddressSanitizer failed to allocate  bytes of LargeMmapAllocator (error code: 12) memory map follows: Q32/coders/jpeg.so Q32/coders/jpeg.so Q32/coders/jpeg.so Q32/coders/jpeg.so Q32/coders/png.so Q32/coders/png.so Q32/coders/png.so Q32/coders/png.so of process memory map.
