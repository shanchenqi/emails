However, the leaked information is physically > visible on the fileserver vice partition, on the wire in FetchData replies and > other RPCs, and on the client cache partition. This constitutes a leak of > directory information.  I'm attaching the full advisory for reference (and to have it int the list archives).  Patches:   Could you please assign a CVE for the directory information leak issue in OpenAFS?
