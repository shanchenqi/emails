Hello all,  Compiling the above regex also causes excessive resource consumption in the portable Irregex (IrRegular Expressions) Scheme package, which can be found at http://synthcode.com/scheme/irregex/.  This code is completely unrelated to WebKit's regex implementation, and a cursory inspection seems to indicate that the underlying cause is different.  So, it might be worthwhile to inspect other regex engines for issues similar to this!  All versions prior to are affected.  The fix is at  This package comes bundled at least with CHICKEN Scheme, Jazz Scheme and Vicare Scheme, and there are "chez-irregex" and "guile-irregex" packages available for GuixSD and perhaps other package managers.  Versions of CHICKEN up to and including are affected.
