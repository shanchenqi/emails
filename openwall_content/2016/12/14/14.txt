Now I also tested original w3m  The original w3m is also affected by at least following CVEs  But the case of which made debian's w3m stack smashing, can only make original w3m heap-buffer-overflow write. I haven't found cases to smash stack yet.  For other CVEs, I don't know. Maybe original w3m is not affected. Maybe those issues are covered by above issues.  kcwu  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
