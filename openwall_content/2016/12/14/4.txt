One common entry is:  ** RESERVED ** This candidate has been reserved by an organization or individual that will use it when announcing a new security problem. When the candidate has been publicized, the details for this candidate will be provided.  This means that the entry number has been reserved by Mitre for an issue or a CNA has reserved the number. So in the case where a CNA requests a block of CVE numbers in advance (e.g. Red Hat currently requests CVEs in blocks of the CVE number will be marked as reserved even though the CVE itself may not be assigned by the CNA for some time. Until the CVE is assigned AND Mitre is made aware of it (e.g. the embargo passes and the issue is made public), AND Mitre has researched the issue and written a description of it, entries will show up as "** RESERVED **".  The good news is this is changing (MITRE will be able to accept descriptions/data from other parties at some point). I don't have an exact time frame though.     > > > > https://curl.haxx.se/docs/security.html: > > > > > > > > > > > > > > Shouldn't Mitre follow a process and update the page after CVEs have > been made public e.g. by upstream project?
