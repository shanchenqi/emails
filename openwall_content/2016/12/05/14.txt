(*) The distros list is for embargoed issues only, whereas this one was being made public at the same time and thus should have been posted to public lists only.  ----- Forwarded message from icing@...che.org -----  From: icing@...che.org Subject: Server memory can be exhausted and service denied when HTTP/2 is used Date: Mon, 5 Dec To: announce@...pd.apache.org          Security Advisory - Apache Software Foundation               Apache HTTPD WebServer  / httpd.apache.org      Server memory can be exhausted and service denied when HTTP/2 is used                     The Apache HTTPD web server (from did not apply limitations on request headers correctly when experimental module for the HTTP/2  protocol is used to access a resource.    The net result is that a the server allocates too much memory instead of denying the request. This can lead to memory exhaustion of the server by a properly crafted request.   Background: - -----------   Apache has limits on the number and length of request header fields. which limits the amount of memory a client can allocate on the server for a request.   Version of the Apache HTTP Server introduced an experimental feature: mod_http2 for the HTTP/2 protocol previous versions were known as  Google SPDY).   This module is NOT compiled in by default -and- is not enabled by default,  although some distribution may have chosen to do so.   It is generally needs to be enabled in the 'Protocols' line in httpd by   adding 'h2' and/or 'h2c' to the 'http/1.1' only default.    The default distributions of the Apache Software Foundation do not include  this experimental feature.    Details: - --------   - From version upto and including version the server failed to take the limitations on request memory use into account when providing  access to a resource over HTTP/2. This issue has been fixed  in version   As a result - with a request using the HTTP/2 protocol a specially crafted request can allocate memory on the server until it reaches its limit. This can lead to denial of service for all requests against the server.   Impact: - -------   This can lead to denial of service for all server resources. Versions affected:  - ------------------ All versions from  to     Resolution: - -----------   For a version a patch is supplied. This will be included in the next release.    Mitigations and work arounds: - -----------------------------   As a temporary workaround - HTTP/2 can be disabled by changing the configuration by removing h2 and h2c from the Protocols line(s) in the configuration file.    The resulting line should read:   		Protocols http/1.1   Credits and timeline - --------------------   The flaw was found and reported by Naveen Tiwari <naveen.tiwari@....edu>   and CDF/SEFCOM at Arizona State University on The issue was   resolved by Stefan Eissing and incorporated in the Apache repository, ready for inclusion in the next release.   Apache would like to thank all involved for their help with this.
