The item in the next file should resemble:   - In ZipInfo ("-Z", /ZIPINFO) short-format ("-s", /SHORT, default)    reports, an unexpectedly large compression method value caused    a (mostly harmless) buffer overflow, and spoiled the report format.    Now, values less than are displayed as before, using a    three-digit decimal format, "uDDD", but larger values are displayed    using a four-digit (unlabled) hexadecimal format, "XXXX".
