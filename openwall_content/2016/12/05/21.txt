The PDF report has a number of comments about Finding 1; however, one comment is "current compilers process this code without issues." A finding can be important to the practice of software development without being important for vulnerability management. For now, the answer is that there is no CVE ID.   > Finding 2: Accessing a buffer of char via a pointer to unsigned int (Low) > UNRESOLVED:This issue remains under discussion  There is no CVE ID. The PDF report mentions, for example, "There are several possible fixes ... Do nothing."   > Finding 3: Out-of-bounds pointer arithmetic in inftrees.c (Low)  >  Use   >  Use   > Finding 4: Undefined left shift of negative number (Low) > Fix:  Use   > Finding 5: Big-endian out-of-bounds pointer (Low) > Fix:  Use  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  9foWchAV8inhIVAMDbwQ =P6rB -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
