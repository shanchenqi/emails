Schweda" <sms@...inode.info> Subject: CVE Request: Info-Zip zipinfo buffer overflow  Alexis Vanden Eijnde has discovered a zipinfo buffer overflow and reported it here:     It is very similar to, but different than, this `unzip -l` crasher:     The zipinfo buffer overflow occurs due to a flaw in zipinfo.c's zi_short() function:  (gdb) bt #0  in __GI_raise (sig=sig@...ry=6) at ../sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/raise.c:54 #1  in __GI_abort () at abort.c:89 #2  in __libc_message (do_abort=do_abort@...ry=2, "*** %s ***: %s terminated\n")     at #3  in __GI___fortify_fail (msg=<optimized out>, "buffer overflow detected") at fortify_fail.c:37 #4  in __GI___chk_fail () at chk_fail.c:28 #5  in _IO_str_chk_overflow (fp=<optimized out>, c=<optimized out>) at vsprintf_chk.c:31 #6  in __GI__IO_default_xsputn data=<optimized out>, n=4) at #7  in _IO_vfprintf_internal format=<optimized out>, "%03u",     at #8  in ___vsprintf_chk flags=1, slen=4, "%03u",     at vsprintf_chk.c:82 #9  in ___sprintf_chk flags=flags@...ry=1, slen=slen@...ry=4, "%03u")     at sprintf_chk.c:31 #10 in sprintf "%03u", at #11 zi_short () at #12 zipinfo () at #13 in do_seekable (lastchance=lastchance@...ry=0) at #14 in process_zipfiles () at #15 in unzip (argc=0, at #16 in __libc_start_main <main>, argc=2, init=<optimized out>, fini=<optimized out>,     rtld_fini=<optimized out>, at #17 in _start ()  The overflow occurs when the two-byte compression method field in the central directory file header is greater then The sprintf at line overflows the methbuf buffer:     static int zi_short(__G)   /* return PK-type error code */   ...        char        methbuf[5];   ...        } else if (methnum >= NUM_METHODS) {   /* unknown */            sprintf(&methbuf[1], "%03u", G.crec.compression_method);        }  An offset of 1 byte + + "\0" fills the entire buffer so a compression method field of and greater overwrites bytes outside of the buffer.  Please assign a CVE. Also, consider assigning a CVE to the related `unzip -l` issue from Thank you!
