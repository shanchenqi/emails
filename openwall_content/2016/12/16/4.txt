Here are my assumptions:  1) We (infosec, technology, basically everyone) needs better context sensitive help/guidance. Obviously this won't happen globally so  2) We (infosec, technology, basically everyone) needs better public documentation on things that people ask, for example the CVE "***RESERVED*** description question I got so often I updated the CVE Wikipedia entry, searchability and SEO ranking is an issue here (what good are docs if google/bing/etc don't show them to people asking questions?)  3) We do have a number of specific sites we should probably target to include the information (Wikipedia, StackExchange sites, etc.)  4) We definitely have a number of sites where people ask questions (this list, Reddit, etc.)  This feeds into my CVE Mentor idea, we need people that can easily be discovered and either know the answers, know where to find the answer, or know who to ask/further direct people to for help. But we need it more generally than just for CVE.  Now, I suspect many of my assumptions are wrong/out dated. So I would appreciate if people would give feedback (where do you go for security info? instagram?) I would appreciate that.  -- Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
