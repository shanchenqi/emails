Our guess is that a vendor's disclosure of an impact, product name, and affected versions means that this can be interpreted as a public security issue.  Use  http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security says "List Content Guidelines ... Any security issues that you post to oss-security should be either already public or to be made public by your posting." It is uncommon to use oss-security as a CVE request channel when the amount of public information is minimal.
