It appeared that the default roster mechanism already has a check in place, but it creates a general event before then, which could be received by another handler to re-implement a Roster differently (like we do in poezio [2]).  This specific bug has been corrected in [3] and [4], which are available in slixmpp (all previous versions are affected).  Iâm not sure if this specific part warrants a CVE, as it is quite a specific case (but people could send arbitrary roster pushes to poezio before then), but I thought it would be good to mention. If it is considered a real security flaw, I have to say that SleekXMPP [5] [6] is also affected, and I will patch it if needed.
