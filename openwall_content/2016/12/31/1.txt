Specifically, Wicket's DiskFileItem class, serialized by Kryo, allows an attacker to hack its serialized form to put a client on an infinite loop if the client attempts to write on the DeferredFileOutputStream attribute.  Mitigation: Upgrade to Apache Wicket or  Credit: This issue was discovered by Jacob Baines, Tenable Network Security and Pedro Santos  References: https://wicket.apache.org/news  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
