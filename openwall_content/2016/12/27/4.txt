This is not strictly command injection. It is more similar to an unrestricted file upload vulnerability. The problem is that you can use the sendmail -X option to write a log file of the SMTP dialog (with an arbitrary path) that then contains e.g. php code which you can execute via a second request. php itself actually prevents you from peforming command injection because according to the documentation of the mail() function, the arguments are wrapped in escape_shellcmd() internally. It just doesn't prevent you from passing arbitrary arguments.  The attack is described here:  Also note that postfix' sendmail implementation does not support the -X option. Additionally I believe there are no other options in postfix' sendmail that are vulnerable to this issue, but feel free to verify this.
