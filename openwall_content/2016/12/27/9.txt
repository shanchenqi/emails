Right; the malicious git repository would have to be created by other means  than "git clone" alone.  The attack scenario I had in mind is:  Alice and Mallory are local users on the same machine. Mallory creates world-readable /tmp/.git such that running "git log" against  this repository compromises the user's account. Alice chdirs to /tmp (or maybe even to a subdirectory of /tmp accessible only  to her), and runs a command that uses the tqdm module under the hood. tqdm  executes "git log", which executes Mallory's code.  >Is either (or both) of these a valid interpretation of your report? > >1.

Otherwise, a CVE is needed for each such product.
