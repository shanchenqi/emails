Our understanding is that .git/config is not really a part of a repository that is controlled by a remote party, e.g., see the second paragraph of the post.  Is either (or both) of these a valid interpretation of your report?  1. You are suggesting that there is a security problem in git because the risks of an attacker-controlled config file are not documented carefully enough. In other words, you want documentation such as https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-config.html to tell the user that they must not use a "repository specific configuration file" that is writable by an untrusted local user.  2. You are suggesting that there is a security problem in tqdm because the victim is not explicitly being told that they are executing a git command, and thus they do not realize that there is a need to verify that they have a safe cwd before proceeding.  If the latter, then do you mean that:  A. Anyone planning to explicitly enter "git log" from a shell prompt is responsible for first verifying that the cwd is safe. It is a known property of git that the cwd is critical to security.  B. No third-party product should ever be executing "git log" in an unexpected context. Either the user must somehow be aware that a "git log" may be executed, or else the product must somehow force the use of a safe local directory. Otherwise, a CVE is needed for each such product.  ?  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =4l/s -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
