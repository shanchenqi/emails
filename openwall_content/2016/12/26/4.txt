It looks like the vulnerability is due to a missing escaping of shell arguments in the sender's e-mail address.  This commit seems to be the one that fixes the bug:  So it depends on whether a web form allows one to control the "from" mail address or not.  > Drupal doesn't contain PHPMailer, although mentioned in the advisory. > But there are probably plugins and extensions using it.

The linked module http://drupal.org/project/smtp also uses PHPMailer. There are undoubtedly more modules that do.  The LCMS system Chamilo also uses PHPMailer for sending mails internally.
