If he wishes, the "nagios" user can replace a specific file with a symlink, and then the init script will chown the target of that symlink to the "nagios" user the next time it is run.  A fix for this was released:   Largely it consists of passing "-h" to chown, preventing chown from following symlinks. And yet symlinks are not the only kind of link. Chown will follow the other kind, too, meaning that the fix in that commit is insufficient. I'm able to pull off the same sort of attack.  I sent a note to the Nagios maintainer a few minutes ago, but I don't know what the best course of action is regarding the CVE. Start a new one? Amend the existing one? Pretend it never happened because it's Christmas?  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
