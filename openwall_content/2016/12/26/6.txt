The text is below.  Thanks, Michael on behalf of the Drupal Security Team.    Posted by Drupal Security Team on December 26, at  Advisory ID: Project: PHPMailer (third-party library) Version: 7.x, 8.x Date: Security risk: (Highly Critical) AC:None/A:User/CI:All/II:All/E:Exploit/TD:All Vulnerability: Arbitrary PHP code execution  Description  The PHPMailer and SMTP modules (and maybe others) add support for sending e-mails using the 3rd party PHPMailer library.  In general the Drupal project does not create advisories for 3rd party libraries. Drupal site maintainers should pay attention to the notifications provided by those 3rd party libraries as outlined in - External libraries and plugins. However, given the extreme criticality of this issue and the timing of its release we are issuing a Public Service Announcement to alert potentially affected Drupal site maintainers.  CVE identifier(s) issued   Versions affected  All versions of the external PHPMailer library <  Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed PHPMailer third party library, there is nothing you need to do.  Solution  Upgrade to the newest version of the phpmailler library. https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer  Reported by  Dawid Golunski  Contact and More Information  The Drupal security team can be reached at security at drupal.org or via the contact form at https://www.drupal.org/contact.
