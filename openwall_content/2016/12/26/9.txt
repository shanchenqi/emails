This was specifically noted at the beginning of but not fixed in either of these commits. It is not the same as the fputc issue in ReadGROUP4Image.  If there is specific information about remaining vulnerabilities, then more CVE IDs can be assigned.   > Check validity of extend during TIFF file reading > ================================================= >  > Debian bug: > Reference URL: > Upstream commit: > Upstream issue: N/A > Upstream version fixed:  Use   > Better check for bufferoverflow for TIFF handling > ================================================= >  > Debian bug: > Reference URL: > Upstream commit: > Upstream issue: N/A > Upstream version fixed:  Use   > Fix out of bound read in viff file handling > =========================================== >  > Debian bug: > Reference URL: > Upstream commit: > Upstream issue: > Upstream version fixed:  Use   > Suspend exception processing if there are too many exceptions > ============================================================= >  > Debian bug: > Reference URL: > Upstream commit: > Upstream issue: N/A > Upstream version fixed: >  > Commit against 6 branch, unknown if fixed or relevant on 7 branch. >  > This commit may also be necessary to trigger exceptions early: >  >  We are not sure why a decision to suspend exception processing would, by itself, fix a vulnerability. (There did not seem to be a fixed-size data structure with storage demands that grew linearly with the number of exceptions.) In the short problem description at the beginning is "Avoid a DOS by better checking overflow." We think this may be more closely related to the changes in coders/viff.c and magick/memory.c.  Use for the issue in coders/viff.c.  Use for the issue in magick/memory.c.  At present there is no CVE ID for an issue in coders/label.c, because we are unsure of whether fixes a vulnerability in that file.  Also, as suggested above, there is currently no CVE ID for an issue in magick/exception.c.  There is currently no CVE ID for  (There is no separate CVE ID for an issue in magick/memory-private.h, although the magick/memory-private.h change is apparently needed in conjunction with both the and changes.)   > Prevent fault in MSL interpreter > ================================ >  > Debian bug: > Reference URL: > Upstream commit: > Upstream issue: > Upstream version fixed:  Use   > Add check for invalid mat file > ============================== >  > Debian bug: > Reference URL: > Upstream commit: > Upstream issue: N/A > Upstream version fixed: >  > Commit against 6 branch, unknown if fixed or relevant on 7 branch.

In a small number of the cases, Brian May made comments about "Not sure if ... are security issues." We did not do any independent research to ascertain whether there were vulnerabilities in those specific cases, although anyone else is, of course, still welcome to do so. When all we have is a "Not sure" statement from a reporter, we do not consider it pending for CVE ID assignment.  Finally, there were three places in your post where an '=' in a URL was apparently entered as '-' instead.
