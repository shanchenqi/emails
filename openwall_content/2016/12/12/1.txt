Description The refactoring of the Connector code for 8.5.x onwards introduced a regression in the error handling of the send file code for the NIO HTTP connector. An error during send file processing resulted in the current Processor object being added to the Processor cache multiple times. This in turn meant that the same Processor could be used for concurrent requests. Sharing a Processor can result in information leakage between requests including, not not limited to, session ID and the response body.  Mitigation Users of the NIO HTTP connector with the affected versions should apply one of the following mitigations - Switch to the NIO2 HTTP or APR HTTP connector - Disable send file - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat or later   (Apache Tomcat has the fix but was not released) - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat or later  Credit: This issue was reported publicly as Bug [1] and the security implications identified by the Tomcat security team.
