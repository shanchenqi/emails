Version fixes two minor vulnerabilities in earlier ikiwiki versions:  ----  authorization bypass  Reference: Vulnerable versions: >= but < Fixed versions: >=  intrigeri discovered that on sites with the git and recentchanges plugins and the CGI interface enabled, the revert links on the RecentChanges page could revert changes on a page the logged-in user cannot legitimately edit, if the change being reverted was made before the page was renamed from a location that the logged-in user *could* legitimately edit. was assigned to this vulnerability, and it was intended to be fixed in  The changes that were intended to address this in were not sufficient when ikiwiki is used with git versions before was assigned to this incomplete fix. In version the incomplete fix has been reverted and replaced with a different solution that should work for all git versions.  ----  commit metadata forgery  Reference: Vulnerable versions: < Fixed versions: >=  CGI::FormBuilder->field has a context-dependent API, similar to the CGI->param API that led to Bugzilla's Parts of ikiwiki incorrectly called this method in list context when a scalar result, which could lead to two relatively minor attacks:  * In the comments plugin, an attacker who was able to post a comment   could give it a user-specified author and author-URL even if the wiki   configuration did not allow for that, by crafting multiple values   to other fields. * In the editpage plugin, an attacker who was able to edit a page   could potentially forge commit authorship by crafting multiple values   for the rcsinfo field.  ----  Thanks to the Debian security team for allocating CVE IDs for these.
