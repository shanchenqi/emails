New releases of legacy branches and have also been released.  Other versions can be patched by adding a single line        info_ptr->max_text = 0;  at the appropriate spot in png.c.  The potential "NULL dereference" bug that has existed in libpng since version of June 26,  To be vulnerable, an application has to load a text chunk into the png structure, then delete all text, then add another text chunk to the same png structure, which seems to be an unlikely sequence, but it has happened.  Applications that I have looked at (firefox, imagemagick, graphicsmagick, pngcrush) do not appear to be vulnerable.  I reported the bug using CERT's online reporting system several days ago but have not received any response.
