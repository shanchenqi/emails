Gday,  I would like a CVE for the following issue:  A flaw was found in the CXGB3 kernel driver when the network was considered congested.  The kernel would incorrectly misinterpret the congestion as an error condition and incorrectly free/clean up the skb. When the device would then send the skb's queued, these structures would be referenced and may panic the system or allow an attacker to escalate privileges in a use-after-free scenario.  The bug and the problematic free is shown shown in the patch[1]:   ----  The cxgb3_*_send() functions return NET_XMIT_ values, which are positive integers values. So don't treat positive return values as an error. ----  Thanks,  Wade Mealing Red Hat Product Security Team  == References:  Upstream fix commit[1]:  Red Hat bug:  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
