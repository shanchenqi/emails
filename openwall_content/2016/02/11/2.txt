This tool is extremely simple: less than lines of code(Python and JavaScript).  If browser tries to access HTTP address, you will have three options: try HTTPS, Google Cache, or copy-and-paste the address.  There is no option to "temporarily bypass HTTPS Only". You can always do that in another browser.
