I am convinced that the proposed patch is wrong and told upstream about it. The patch prevents features of cacti that allow an authenticated user who is not in the cacti database to get *specified* access to cacti. I don't know how many setups are using this feature, but the patch is a regression for those setups. The patch does not change anything in the configuration tab in the UI, so this at least leads to a confusing situation.
