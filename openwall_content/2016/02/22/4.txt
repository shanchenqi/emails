On investigation some of these issues have already had CVE requests however as far as I can tell, CVEs were not assigned (apologies if I missed something), and I am not sure why.  As there are no CVEs allocated, I have used the temp ids given by Debian for now.  https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/imagemagick    multiple vulnerabilities found by Google  CVE was already requested here:    Integer and Buffer overflow in coders/icon.c  CVE was already requested here:    Double free in  CVE was already requested here:    is multiple issues; each should have its own CVE. Not sure if the momory leaks or the "PixelColor off by one" are security issues, have included them here for sake of being complete:     - Memory Leaks         Upstream fix:      - Out of bounds error in SpliceImage         Upstream fix:      - Prevent null pointer access in magick/constitute.c     https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/pull/34     Upstream fix:      - PixelColor off by one on     https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/54     Upstream fix:                      - Fixed memory leak when reading incorrect PSD files     Upstream fix:   Regards --  Brian May <brian@...uxpenguins.xyz> https://linuxpenguins.xyz/brian/  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
