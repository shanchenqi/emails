Let me please, note, that this flaw is very similar to already existing This is the same type of a flaw, which just exists in the different function treo_attach() (instead of clie_5_attach()), so probably we can use the same for this.  Description:  A local kernel crash on invalid USB device requiring the visor driver was reported. The treo_attach() function of the [visor] driver, which is called during the driver initialization process, was dereferencing the bulk-in and interrupt-in urbs without first making sure they had been allocated by the core. Due to an incomplete sanity check, the visor driver tries to dereference null-pointers, which results in crash.
