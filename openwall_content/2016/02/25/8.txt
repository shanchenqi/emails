Find attached a test case to reproduce them. The ASAN report of the first one is here:  $ ./cpio -i < overflow.cpio  ./cpio: warning: skipped 8 bytes of junk ================================================================= AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address at pc bp sp READ of size 2 at thread T0     #0 in strchr     #1 in path_contains_symlink     #2 in process_copy_in     #3 in main     #4 in __libc_start_main     #5   is located 0 bytes to the right of 2-byte region allocated by thread T0 here:     #0 in realloc     #1 in xrealloc     #2 in process_copy_in     #3 in main     #4 in __libc_start_main  and the second one is here:  $ ./cpio -t < overflow.cpio  ./cpio: warning: skipped 8 bytes of junk ================================================================= AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address at pc bp sp READ of size 3 at thread T0     #0      #1 in __interceptor_vprintf     #2 in __interceptor_printf     #3 in list_file     #4 in process_copy_in     #5 in main     #6 in __libc_start_main     #7   is located 0 bytes to the right of 2-byte region allocated by thread T0 here:     #0 in realloc     #1 in xrealloc     #2 in process_copy_in     #3 in main     #4 in __libc_start_main  These issues were found using QuickFuzz.
