The overflows can manifest as a segmentation fault or as memory corruption during a parse operation. The bugs allow for a denial of service attack in many applications by an unauthenticated attacker, and could conceivably result in remote code execution.  Mitigation: Applications that are using library versions older than should upgrade as soon as possible. Distributors of older versions should apply the patches from this subversion revision:   Credit: This issue was reported by Gustavo Grieco.
