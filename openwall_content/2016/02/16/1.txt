The proxy incorrectly handles server TLS failure which almost always results in crashing the entire proxy. Denying service for all other clients using it.  Our Advisory will be at: "  This problem allows any trusted client to perform a denial of  service attack on the Squid service regardless of whether TLS or  SSL is configured for use in the proxy.   Misconfigured client or server software may trigger this issue  to perform a denial of service unintentionally.   However, the bug is exploitable only if Squid is built using the  --with-openssl option. "  Versions and are affected.  Patch for 3.5 is atch>.  Patch for 4.0 is atch>. Though as a beta release we would prefer people update straight to the new package.
