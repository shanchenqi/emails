This does not mean that a PHP 5.x issue from has a different CVE ID.)  Use for the issue that was fixed in the release. We understand that this was in the:     commit. This commit has most of the changes that were made in ext/phar/tar.c between the release and the release. There was also a change from "if (entry.filename_len == UINT_MAX)" to "if (entry.filename_len == UINT_MAX || entry.filename_len == 0)" that may be unrelated.  The UTC" comment in seems to discuss an additional concern. If there is a remaining vulnerability that was not fixed in that vulnerability is not covered by the ID.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =hnVy -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
