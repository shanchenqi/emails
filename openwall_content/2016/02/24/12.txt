Our Advisory is at:   First issue;  the proxy contains a String object class with 64KB content limits. Some code paths do not bounds check before appending to these String and overflow leads to an assertion which terminates all client transactions using the proxy, including those unrelated to the limit being exceeded.  A PoC has already been published for one attack vector using HTTP "Vary" response header. When the Vary pattern presented by a server expands to more than 64KB the DoS is triggered. For example:  Vary: Cookie,Cookie,Cookie,Cookie,... However, there are currently 4 known distinct vectors (types of remotely provided input) with varying degrees of difficulty to trigger the assertion.  Patch URLs that workaround 3 of those vectors (though not fully solve) are: atch>  This patch fixes the other related variant of the basic problem. Though this instance is not triggerable from outside a controlled CDN environment: atch>    Secondary issue;  Error handling for malformed HTTP responses can lead to a second assertion with the same effects as the first issue. It is not easily triggered in Squid-3 or normally in Squid-4.  However fixing the String issue makes it become easily triggerable in Squid-4, and we do have a history of the assertion itself being reported as occuring already but been unable to identify the vectors code path to replicate it yet. So believe it can be achieved independent of the String issues, even if we are unable so far to identify how.  Patch URLs for this are: atch>    Amos Jeffries Squid Software Foundation -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (MingW32)  =mNRl -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
