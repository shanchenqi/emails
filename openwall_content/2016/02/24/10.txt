So for pt_chown, this could hopefully be > just an Ubuntu issue.  And Debian 8 (but not the future Debian 9, at least on Linux kernels), and probably other distributions where backward compat was a concern.  has some interesting background. The Debian and Ubuntu glibc maintainers tried turning off pt_chown in but had to turn it back on because it caused too many regressions: in particular "mount -t devpts devpts-foo chroot-foo/dev/pts" apparently alters the mount options for the "real" /dev/pts, not just the one being mounted in the chroot (presumably losing the noexec,nosuid,gid=5 and or options that are expected in Debian). I don't know whether the default mount options were subsequently altered in util-linux and/or the kernel as suggested on that bug, or whether manually mounting devpts is just not going to be a supported action in Debian 9.
