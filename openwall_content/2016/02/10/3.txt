See https://mpc-hc.org/changelog/ for the MPC-HC changelog, and for more details on the issue and practical exploitation of it.  The main issue here is that the Web UI does not have any authentication, something which (besides the already mentioned issue) enables an attacker on the same network to start media files on the MPC-HC running on the affect machine.  Could a CVE be assigned for this please?
