We can assign a CVE ID if there is going to be a DSA.  One concern is that the design may not be intended for environments with untrusted clients, and many other issues may be found. Also, we aren't sure about the patch:  +   if (!isalnum(page_name[0])) +        return FALSE; +    +    if (strstr(page_name, "..")) +         return FALSE;  e.g., what about C:\file.txt if it's possible to build this on Windows.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  NRFKU2HYn0DCATgFJCdv =GYQp -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
