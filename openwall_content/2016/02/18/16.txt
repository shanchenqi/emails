Here is a fully functioning local root by clobbering /etc/ld.so.preload instead of /etc/shadow (which breaks things spectacularly). I am using a fairly messy "symlink spray"/"symlink carpet bombing" technique.  Simply point it at a setuid-root binary compiled with asan and away it goes.  Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSIm3auQMk PoC Code:  Development/Testing was done on a Debian 8.3 VM that was last updated last week.  Now, I wonder - what can actually be done to mitigate against this, besides "don't use ASAN in production"? Is there something that can be done ASAN-side? Because due to how ld.so.preload is parsed so, uh, forgivingly, all the attacker needs to control is one line in the output file. Could it check for symlinks before writing the log?
