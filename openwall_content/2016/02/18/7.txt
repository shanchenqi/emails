We found this wording to be somewhat confusing, but we believe we understand what was meant, so the CVE ID is included below.  Essentially, we think "attacker being able to present a certificate chain with a certificate issued by one trusted certificate authority, and additionally including the pinned certificate authority" was intended to state "attacker being able to present a certificate chain with a certificate issued by one trusted certificate authority, and additionally include the pinned certificate." The use of "including" instead of "include" in that sentence seemed to imply that "including the pinned certificate authority" was a phrase describing the server end-entity certificate: that would not make sense.
