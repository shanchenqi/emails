This can lead to issues when the parent table would have denied the operation, but no denial occurs because the partition-level privilege is not checked by the authorization framework, which defines authorization entities only from the table level upwards.  This issue is known to affect Hive clusters protected by both Ranger as well as SqlStdHiveAuthorization.  Mitigation:  For Hive 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2, a separate jar is being made available, which users can put in their ${HIVE_HOME}/lib/, and this provides a hook for administrators to add to their hive-site.xml, by setting hive.semantic.analyzer.hook=org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.parse.ParentTableAuthorizationHook . This parameter is a comma-separated-list and this hook can be appended to an existing list if one already exists in the setup. You will then want to make sure that you protect the hive.semantic.analyzer.hook parameter from being changed at runtime by adding it to hive.conf.restricted.list.  This jar and associated source tarball are available for download over at : https://hive.apache.org/downloads.html along with their gpg-signed .asc signatures, as well as the md5sums for verification in the hive-parent-auth-hook/ directory.  This issue has already been patched in all Hive branches that are affected, and is fixed in the recently released Hive Hive and any future release will not need these mitigation steps.
