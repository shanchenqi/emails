Successful exploitation might allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code   with the privileges of the socat process.   This vulnerability can only be exploited when an attacker is able to   inject data into socat's command line.   A vulnerable scenario would be a CGI script that reads data from   clients and uses (parts of) this data as hostname for a Socat   invocation.
