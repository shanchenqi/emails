The effective cryptographic strength of a key   exchange using these parameters was weaker than the one one could get by   using a prime p. Moreover, since there is no indication of how these   parameters were chosen, the existence of a trapdoor that makes possible   for an eavesdropper to recover the shared secret from a key exchange that   uses them cannot be ruled out.   A new prime modulus p parameter has been generated by Socat developer   using OpenSSL dhparam command.   In addition the new parameter is bit long.
