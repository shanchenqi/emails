By removing the last location of an image, an authenticated user may change the image status back to queued and may be able to upload new image data resulting in a broken Glance's immutability promise. A malicious tenant may exploit this flaw to silently replace image data it owns, regardless of the original creator or the visibility settings. Only setups with show_multiple_locations enabled (not default) are affected.   Patches ~~~~~~~ - (Kilo) - (Liberty) - (Mitaka)   Credits ~~~~~~~ - Erno Kuvaja from HPE   References ~~~~~~~~~~ - -   Notes ~~~~~ - This fix will be included in future (kilo) and   (liberty) releases. - The proposed fix prevents the removal of the last location of an   image so that an active image is always available. This action was   previously incorrectly allowed and the fix might break some users who   are relying on the false assumption that it would be ok to replace   the data of existing image in the special case that the multiple   locations has been configured.  -- Tristan Cacqueray OpenStack Vulnerability Management Team   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
