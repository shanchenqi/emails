Our question is about whether anyone needs two CVE IDs.  SUSE acknowledges that one CVE ID would be useful for the "was not prime" finding, and would not need a second CVE ID.  SUSE distributions, except for the openSUSE Tumbleweed rolling community distribution, is not affected:  Andreas  --  Andreas Stieger <astieger@...e.com> Project Manager Security SUSE Linux GmbH, GF: Felix ImendĂśrffer, Jane Smithard, Graham Norton, HRB (AG NĂźrnberg)     Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
