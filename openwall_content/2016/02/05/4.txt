You also report that this code is in "use verbatim" in "the vast majority of sites", yet looking at the Debian code base, the only samples of that code I could find are in php-openid itself and the SAML library:  https://codesearch.debian.net/search?perpkg=1&q=getTrustRoot  (jglobus seems to be a false positive there)  I have reviewed the usage of the openid.realm field in the Debian source code and, in general, it doesn't seem to use the `Host:` header:  https://codesearch.debian.net/search?perpkg=1&q=openid.realm  Furthermore, I am not sure the attack works even on the theoritical level: how would the user reach the proper website if the Host header is changed?
