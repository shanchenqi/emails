The function did not properly calculate buffer sizes, possibly leading to a heap-based memory corruption. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could exploit this flaw to cause foomatic-rip to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code.  This is a rather old bug, which was fixed upstream a long time ago.  Fixed in: rev of the HEAD branch and rev of the 4.0.x branch  References:  Upstream bug:  RH bug:  Thanks, --  Stefan Cornelius / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
