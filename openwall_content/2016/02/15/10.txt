Best, Arun Suresh   ----------   Encryption of intermediate data and spills to the local file system in Hadoop MapReduce is vulnerable to unauthorized disclosure of data.  Severity: Severe  Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation  Versions Affected: All versions of Hadoop 2.6.x  Users affected: Users who have enabled Hadoop's Intermediate data encryption feature  Impact: RPC traffic from clients, potentially including authentication credentials, may be intercepted by a malicious user with access to run tasks or containers on a cluster.  Description: The encryption key/secret used to encrypt the intermediate data generated by an Apache Hadoop MapReduce job is stored as a token in the jobâs credentials and are subsequently serialized to disk ( without any additional encryption/protection ) into the machine's local dirs.  A malicious user who has access to this credentials file can load the tokens from the file, read the secret and then decrypt the intermediate data which is also stored in machine local dirs.   Mitigation: Users of Hadoop 2.6.x versions prior should upgrade to a 2.7.x release (where the issue has been fixed) or disable the feature when running MapReduce jobs.  Credit: This issue was discovered by Hitesh Shah of Hortonworks.  ----------   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
