This one has details.)  Summary  This tool completely locks browser - just HTTPS, nothing else. This tool is extremely simple - less than lines of code(Python and JavaScript).  Why  Firefox Add-on Firesheep Brings Hacking to the Masses "Firesheep is basically a packet sniffer that can analyze all the unencrypted Web traffic" (Quite a while ago, it's become a "casual game")  Yes, Mozilla said, "Gradually phasing out access to browser features for non-secure websites", in April After more than six months, they have done nothing useful.  The Chrome team wanted the same stuff: https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/marking-http-as-non-secure Again, nothing significant has been achieved yet.
