More specifically, we don't know of cases where the relevant cpio source code (e.g., copyin.c) has been adapted for use in a library for a long-running process in a different product that also operates on untrusted input, although this might be plausible because a variety of products may want cpio support.  A CVE ID may be available if the upstream response indicates that the out-of-bounds reads allow the attacker to change the flow of control.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  HX6rsYGYOtDvyyLZqY1o =pd0F -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
