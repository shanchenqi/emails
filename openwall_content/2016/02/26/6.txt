Credit to Brian Gerst who noticed the bug.  This bug is present in all kernels from on AFAICT.  Kernels before don't support SMAP in the first place.  32-bit kernels are not affected (but why would you be running a 32-bit kernel on SMAP-capable hardware in the first place?).  --Andy  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
