The issue occurs when the USB hub gets disconnected before or while the routine for USB hub activation is running - hub_activate() function.  Bug reported on the kernel USB mailing list:  Issue is fixed in kernel 4.4, by commit:  Could a CVE please be assigned to this issue? (it has not been previously requested anywhere else)  Thanks,    Alex  --- Regards,  Alexandru Cornea Security QA Engineer Intel SSG OTC Romania    Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
