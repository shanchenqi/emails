These can allow a user to DoS the system.              "A slave timer instance might be still accessible in a racy way while operating the master instance as it lacks of locking. Since the master operation is mostly protected with timer->lock, we should cope with it while changing the slave instance, too."   "some linked lists (active_list and ack_list) of slave instances aren't unlinked immediately at stopping or closing, and this may lead to unexpected accesses."    - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  wKFVHjVNZCm0tfXoKnXA =v4ix -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
