ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  VMX refuses attempts to enter a guest with an instruction pointer which doesn't satisfy certain requirements.  In particular, the instruction pointer needs to be canonical when entering a guest currently in 64-bit mode.  This is the case even if the VM entry information specifies an exception to be injected immediately (in which case the bad instruction pointer would possibly never get used for other than pushing onto the exception handler's stack).  Provided the guest OS allows user mode to map the virtual memory space immediately below the canonical/non- canonical address boundary, a non-canonical instruction pointer can result even from normal user mode execution. VM entry failure, however, is fatal to the guest.  IMPACT ======  Malicious HVM guest user mode code may be able to crash the guest.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen versions are affected.  Only systems using Intel or Cyrix CPUs are affected. ARM and AMD systems are unaffected.  Only HVM guests are affected.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only PV guests will avoid this vulnerability.  Running HVM guests on only AMD hardware will also avoid this vulnerability.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Ling Liu of Qihoo Inc.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch works around this issue.  Note that it does so in a way which isn't architecturally correct, but no better solution has been found (nor suggested by Intel).            xen-unstable, Xen 4.6.x       Xen 4.5.x, Xen 4.4.x       Xen 4.3.x  $    $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.   (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
