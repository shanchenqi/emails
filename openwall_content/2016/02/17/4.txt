The "Other Interesting Tools" section has tools to easily switch proxy of your browser(FoxyProxy, etc). You want HTTPS-Only internet, that's what this tool does; you want normal internet, just click that FoxyProxy icon(yes, it's really easy).  2. The "What HTTPS Doesnât Do" section has very clear words about HTTPS limitations. Even though it's from US government, it's actually very clear words.
