This is roughly what mozilla does and I like it a lot. They have a bug tracker over https and you can add a PGP key. If you don't add a PGP key and report a security bug you won't get updates via mail unencrypted.  I think this is definitely an area that could need improvement. A lot of projects don't have any reasonable way to securely report bugs. And some actively discourage reporting bgus in a secure way (apache has some note on their webpage that you may send your reports encrypted to some people, but have to expect longer delays if you do so instead of using the "normal" unencrypted way). One problem is also that e.g. the github bugtracker (and I think many other bugtrackers as well) doesn't consider sensitive bug reports.  But I also agree with Florian: Part of the problem can be mitigated by not keeping things under the hood for too long. I'm often disappointed with slow reaction times.  --  Hanno Bรถck https://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
