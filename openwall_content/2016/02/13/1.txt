(those with capabilities to monitor large amount of network traffic) to just record all mails from large-scale Linux distribution collaboration and issue tracking systems containing the keyword "security", and as this is very cheap way to get to near-zero day material, I would assume, that this is already done. This is like serving them zero days on a golden plate.  Hence really critical security material perhaps should not go to such platforms, e.g. Ubuntu Launchpad, or the platform should be modified to send security issues only in encrypted mails without talkative title, members without mail public key registered should get only message "Bug [Number]: Info changed" including the HTTPS link to the issue in the platform.  What do you think?  Does someone have a link to anyone having access to the selector lists leaked by Snowden to ask them, which of the distros are already in scope or otherwise to discard this e-mail as pure paranoia?  Kind regards, hd  - --  http://www.halfdog.net/ PGP: AE98 B91F FE88  2BD8 feed a bee -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =9VEH -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
