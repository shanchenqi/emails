But at least some of the issues going to be communicated on distros list were handled in various bug tracking and collaboration platforms up to the point, that severe security impact is confirmed. I would guess that quite a number of issues stays in that state for about 2-6 month before making it to distros list and beginning of the maximum 2 weeks final embargo time.  Data communicated in the final 2 weeks is secured but I am worried about the 6 month centralized, structured and unencrypted communication before that, which might be not so hard to tap into.  > On PM, halfdog wrote: >> Hello List, >>  >> As just written in a mail to another list, this might also be  >> interesting for discussion here.: >>  >> As it would be the most natural thing for e.g. NSA, China, ...  >> (those with capabilities to monitor large amount of network  >> traffic) to just record all mails from large-scale Linux  >> distribution collaboration and issue tracking systems containing  >> the keyword "security", and as this is very cheap way to get to  >> near-zero day material, I would assume, that this is already >> done.
