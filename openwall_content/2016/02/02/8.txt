Ubuntu won't issue an Ubuntu Security Notice for the socat issue (because socat is in our "universe" archive); however, we wouldn't find it useful to have a second CVE assigned for "no indication of how these parameters were chosen" or "cannot be ruled out".  This is one area where distro needs don't align with MITRE's: one CVE per line of code is sufficient for us but not for MITRE. When in doubt I'd suggest to limit the number of CVEs issued just on the principle of less work for everyone. When it's clear, of course, do what you must; we're lucky we get to use CVEs to identify issues, and some slight duplication (from our perspective) is a price well worth paying to use CVE's many positive benefits.
