Its most prominent user is GnuTLS.  Through fuzzing of elliptic curve scalar multiplications (multiplying a point on an elliptic curve with a scalar number) I discovered two carry propagation bugs that would lead the cauculations to produce wrong results. They affect the NIST and curves. The bug is in the C code and affects multiple architectures. The bug is in the assembly code and only affects 64 bit x86.  While analyzing these bugs Nettle developer Niels Mรถller discovered another carry propagation bug in that was fixed in the same commit. Nettle 3.2 fixes all three bugs.  The impact is currently unclear, but miscalculations in cryptographic functions should generally be considered security issues. I'd like to encourage cryptographers to try to analyze whether these bugs can lead to cryptographic breaks.  https://github.com/hannob/bignum-fuzz/blob/master/point-fuzz.c I have published a code example on how to fuzz elliptic curve multiplications. It can compare the output of OpenSSL with either Nettle or NSS. It currently works only with prime field curves, but it can probably be adapted to other curves.  bug: Mailing list post with code sample Commit / fix for bug  bug: Mailing list post with code sample Commit / fix for bug  Nettle 3.2 release notes  --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
