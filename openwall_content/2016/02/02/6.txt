This was sent to the oss-security list as a published advisory, not as a CVE ID request. We would expect that one or more parties (e.g., Linux distributions) are planning to re-announce this to a different audience in a way that would make at least one CVE ID especially useful. Our question is about whether anyone needs two CVE IDs.  A CVE ID must be for a specific vulnerability (although we realize that the CVE ID may often be used to track the update). Here, there can be a CVE ID for the "was not prime" finding in the sense that p is supposed to be prime, and a non-prime value is an implementation error regardless of any other details of the situation. With the currently published information, we do not see a way to generate a second CVE ID for something related to "no indication of how these parameters were chosen" or "cannot be ruled out."  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =P0EG -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
