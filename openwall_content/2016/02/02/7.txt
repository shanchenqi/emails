This was sent to the oss-security list as a published advisory, not as a CVE ID request. Is there anyone (e.g., a Linux distribution) who is planning to re-announce this to a different audience in a way that would make a CVE ID especially useful? Note that there will be a CVE ID for the simultaneously released "security advisory 7."  At this point, the MITRE CVE team does not see a realistic exploitation scenario (for security advisory 8) that would be best categorized as a socat problem that requires a socat CVE ID. For example, "a CGI script that reads data from clients and uses (parts of) this data as hostname for a Socat invocation" might be better categorized as an SSRF vulnerability in that CGI script (and potentially site-specific unless such a CGI script already exists in packaged code).  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =FQZ0 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
