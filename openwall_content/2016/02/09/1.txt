Unfortunately, I've not been able to get the download to happen as I need to look into what happens when the application requests PROPFIND /check.php?pkgfmt=dmg HTTP/1.1 At this point the download is marked as stalled whilst attempting to download LibreOffice I'd announced.  Though the original report used Windows, I repeated on OS X trying to see if libreoffice could just download a mp4 video, later changed to a dmg. Using the following check.php <?php echo '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> <inst:description xmlns:inst="http://update.libreoffice.org/description"> <inst:id>LibreOffice <inst:os>MacOSX</inst:os> <inst:arch>x86</inst:arch> <inst:update type="application/octet-stream" src="http://update.libreoffice.org/update.dmg"/> </inst:description>'; ?>  Is this of concern at this stage?
