The Chrome team wanted the same stuff: https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/marking-http-as-non-secure Again, nothing significant has been achieved yet.  And there is HTTPS Everywhere, with SO MANY rules: https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere/atlas/ It's still able to access HTTP by default, but there is "Block all HTTP requests". The problem: nothing happens when browser tries HTTP - there should be warning(it's incorrect behavior) and options(try HTTPS, Google Cache, etc). People complained, months ago:  So I made this project, because I have lost patience a long time ago.
