What is the average gmail user supposed to do with this information? While it draws a parallel to the lock icon in browsers to indicate HTTPS is used I think this overstates how "secure" an email is just because it was sent over one hop using STARTTLS.  If Google actually feels STARTTLS is important enough to users to show them an icon then they should use this as step one and announce step two is requiring STARTTLS on a specific date. That only works, of course, if they announce their intention _and_ a date.  > I was surprised to see this indicator on mail from oss-security.

That'd be "listadmin [at] oss [dash] security [dot] openwall [dot] org" http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security  Probably Alexander. :)  It doesn't seem like a top priority to me: STARTTLS solves one set of problems and introduces a much larger set of problems. I'm not sure any of the solved problems are actually pressing problems to a public mail list.  Hosting a mail list is already miserable enough (for example, I don't think mail From: google addresses actually makes to Google users; also, I don't know how the moderators manage to keep this list spam-free with zero mistakes, either false positives or false negatives.) -- adding a half-dozen more reasons why mail delivery can fail is surely not fun.
