Use for the vulnerability that was fixed in  At this point, we are not assigning any CVE IDs for potential "incomplete fix" issues mentioned in the post, such as "The CRT code used for RSA signing uses other functions which may leak, in particular division functions with branches depending on secret data ... exponents use a normalized size field (so top limb is non-zero). This might still leak information about the top exponent bits ... Mini-gmp builds don't try to be side-channel silent."  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =Z0L4 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
