Hi,  I don't have a practical exploit scenario, thus my careful wording (the best answer to "is this exploitable?" is often simply "I don't know").  It's a use after free, should be undeniable that it should be fixed.  But my highlevel understanding of what could happen in such a case: In a multithreaded application using that module it may be possible that another thread is allocating the free'd memory before do_error is called and may fill the memory of the struct with attacker-controlled content. Would require careful analysis of what do_error does exactly whether that could lead to further bad things.  --  Hanno Bรถck https://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
