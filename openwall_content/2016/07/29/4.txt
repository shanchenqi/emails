As for data itself, the history could also contain sensitive information; for instance, if usernames for some other service were stored in a mongo collection, the history could contain lines like:    db.users.find({user:"foo"})  or even:    db.users.update({user:"foo"},{$set:{password:"OhComeOnNow"}})  Cheers,  --Seb   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
