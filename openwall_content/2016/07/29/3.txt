Once a machine joins, it becomes a Swarm Node. Nodes can either be worker nodes or manager nodes.  I found a vulnerability in docker of the latest version which could cause a Denial of Service, it results in a machine could not join the swarm cluster after another node’s repeatedly joining and quitting the swarm for many times(taking my testing as example , it should need at least one thousand times. )Moreover, the docker debugging info indicates the Dispatcher is stopped and ca server may exited sometimes.   # docker version Client: Version:      API version:  Go version:   Git commit:   Built:        Fri Jul 29 OS/Arch:      linux/amd64  Server: Version:      API version:  Go version:   Git commit:   Built:        Fri Jul 29 OS/Arch:      linux/amd64  # docker swarm init Swarm initialized: current node is now a manager.  To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:     docker swarm join \     --token \      To add a manager to this swarm, run the following command:     docker swarm join \     --token \     xx.xx.xx.xx  Login machine A1 and join the swarm ,and then quitted the swarm. ----------------------------------------------------- # docker swarm join --token This node joined a swarm as a worker. # docker swarm leave --force Node left the swarm.
