Right, the file does not need to be empty (file length of zero), but inbuf->len needs to end up being zero, which means that the g_iconv calls produce zero output bytes for every line of the input file. After the buffer under-read, if there isn't a crash, the return value of read_file can be the empty string, which wasn't intended to be a possible return value. However, we haven't seen information indicating that this causes a security problem in later code. This is a command-line program, and the available information is that there is sometimes a non-exploitable crash when operating on an invalid file. For now, we are categorizing this as an inconvenience to the user, not a vulnerability: there is no CVE ID.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
