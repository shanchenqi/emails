Later, I discovered that an empty file has the same behaviour of  the crafted.  In other words: - The same crash happen for the empty and crafted file. - The patch covers both cases (when the file is empty and when  contains random data).  -- Agostino Sarubbo   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
