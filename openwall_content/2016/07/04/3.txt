For instance,  there is a read out-of-bounds in librsvg2 (a dependency of gdk-pixbuf used to render svg images), which can be easily triggered if you try to attach a svg in Firefox. I tested it in Ubuntu using the corresponding version of librsvg2 with debug symbols) and Firefox. To reproduce:  1. Download and unpack boom.tar.gz somewhere. 2. gdb --args /usr/lib/firefox/firefox 3. Execute "run" and try to attach (ctrl+o) the svg file inside boom directory in Firefox.  Result:  Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault. in rsvg_pattern_fix_fallback at        rsvg-paint-server.c: No such file or directory.

Fortunately, this issue is already solved in the last revision of librsvg2 (AFAIK, this issue has no CVE, so please MITRE assign one if suitable). Nevertheless, I reported such vulnerability to Mozilla more than a month ago hoping that they will disable the svg support in the open/attach widget. After some discussion, it was marked as WONTFIX. While i understand why, i still feel it can be productive to discuss this here.  (the same trick can be used to crash Chrome/Chromium, since the code to open/attach an image is almost the same, so this is not a Firefox specific issue)   Regards, Gustavo  Download attachment "boom.tar.gz" of type "application/x-gzip" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
