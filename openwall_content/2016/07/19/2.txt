Not everyone is free to do it: the decision belongs to whoever is responsible for assigning CVE IDs to that product at that point in time. Keep in mind that no one is forcing Google to have a public bug report stating "Update harfbuzz to ... There are a few security bugs fixed between and Google could have decided to announce only that "we occasionally update Chrome's components to the latest upstream version for any reason or no reason." Because that public bug report existed, it gave MITRE the opportunity to put a HarfBuzz entry into the CVE corpus. This is presumably of some value to other vendors that ship HarfBuzz, even though it is not optimal. The information readily available to us was that the product name was HarfBuzz, the vulnerable version was the fixed version was and the type of problem was denial of service. Going beyond that requires expensive analysis, given that HarfBuzz issue is described as "This in an umbrella issue for setting up regular fuzzing for harfbuzz and fixing the bugs that we find with fuzzing." The earlier portion of this thread indicates that you contributed significant analysis effort to report "i realized that there are atleast 3 issues in here which are CVE worthy," and yet one of the cited issues was about unreleased code that was corrected during the development cycle within one day.  This is not solely a question of whether a third party has motivation to do some analysis: it is also a question of whether it is typically feasible for third parties to understand everything. Ultimately, it would work better if the direct developers of the code recognized value in CVE, and made the CVE requests and/or assignments themselves.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  LmvoqV0EBi9pkcVuaxCw =e3xo -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
