The memory leak was a consequence of the original fix, and was eliminated minutes later during development.   > ** idn: Solve out-of-bounds-read when reading one zero byte as input. > Also replaced fgets with getline. Reported by Hanno Boeck  idn is described at http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/libidn.git/tree/src/idn.c as "Command line interface to the internationalized domain name library." An out-of-bounds read in a command-line program is not always security relevant. Also, lists the various items as "Noteworthy changes" and not specifically as security fixes. We think you might mean that someone can use idn to convert a file, and then send the converted file to an untrusted party. If there is an out-of-bounds read, then the converted file might include arbitrary data from process memory.  > Fix: >  Use   > Follow-up fix: >  Use   > ** libidn: stringprep_utf8_nfkc_normalize reject invalid UTF-8. > It was always documented to only accept UTF-8 data, but now it doesn't > crash when presented with such data.
