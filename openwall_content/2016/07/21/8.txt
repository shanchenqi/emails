Could I have a CVE for this issue?  All versions before 0.5 are affected.  An announcement was made to  The spiffy-cgi-handlers code was part of the spiffy web server before version 5.0, so earlier versions of that egg were also affected.  Strictly speaking, I think this deserves another CVE because it's a different piece of software.  >    2. >  >    A web application makes use of HTTP_PROXY or similar variable unsafely >    (e.g. fails to check the request type) resulting in an attacker controlled >    proxy being used (essentially when HTTP_PROXY is actually used unsafely)  I believe this affects the CHICKEN egg "http-client", when used in a CGI context when the calling server unsafely passes "Proxy" as "HTTP_PROXY". Could I have a CVE for this issue as well?  It affects http-client versions before (the very first version, 0.1, is not affected because it had no proxy support).  An announcement for this is included in the message at the aforementioned URL.
