Applications and users that use XLSX2CSV and accept such files from end-users are vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, which allow remote attackers to bypass security restrictions and read arbitrary files via a crafted OpenXML document that provides an XML external entity declaration in conjunction with an entity reference.  Mitigation: Upgrade to or higher    Credit: This issue was discovered by Mauro Gentile of Minded Security.
