It could occur while doing DMA  read into ESP command buffer 's->cmdbuf'; It could write past the 's->cmdbuf'  area, if it was transferring more than 16 bytes in esp_do_dma().  A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process  resulting in DoS OR potentially leverage it to execute arbitrary code with  privileges of the Qemu process on the host.
