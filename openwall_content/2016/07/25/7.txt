Biederman" <ebiederm@...ssion.com>,  	Shadow package maintainers <pkg-shadow-devel@...ts.alioth.debian.org> Subject: Re: Re: [Pkg-shadow-devel] subuid security patches for  shadow package  Hi,  While this is not immediately clear from the Shadow homepage the development continued on GitHub where I have opened two issues for the two potential security problems:  Incorrect integer handling https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/issues/27  Potentially unsafe use of getlogin https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/issues/28  Probably upstream's issue tracker would be the best place to discuss the fixes in detail. With upstream development happening on GitHub the pkg-shadow-devel list could host mostly Debian-packaging releated discussions and probably not all oss-security subscribers would like to get all the messages.
