They just have to set the id as API parameter.  Affects Foreman 1.7 and higher Fix released in Foreman and   2) privilege escalation in organizations/locations API and UI  When accessing Foreman as a user limited to specific organization or location, these are not taken into account in the API or parts of the UI. This allows a user to view, edit and delete organizations and locations they are not associated with if they have the requisite permissions.  Affects Foreman 1.1 and higher Fix released in Foreman and   Mitigation for both vulnerabilities: make sure you have filters restricted to organizations or locations when you limit user by assigning them to particular organizations or locations.
