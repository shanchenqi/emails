Hello All,  A flaw was found in the linux kernel's implementation of the airspy USB device driver in which a leak was found when a subdev or SDR are plugged into the host.  An attacker can create an targeted USB device which can emulate 64 of these devices. Then by emulating an additional device which continuously connects and disconnects, each connection attempt will leak memory which can not be recovered.
