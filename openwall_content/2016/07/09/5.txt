As it turns out, the fix for wget was incomplete, not covering the special case of HTTP to FTP redirects.  This is addressed in wget released a month ago:   "This version fixes a security vulnerability present in all old versions of wget.  The vulnerability was discovered by Dawid Golunski which were reported to us by Beyond Security's SecuriTeam.  On a server redirect from HTTP to a FTP resource, wget would trust the HTTP server and uses the name in the redirected URL as the destination filename. This behaviour was changed and now it works similarly as a redirect from HTTP to another HTTP resource so the original name is used as the destination file.  To keep the previous behaviour the user must provide --trust-server-names."  Upstream commit:   Exploit:  http://legalhackers.com/advisories/Wget-Arbitrary-File-Upload-Vulnerability-Exploit.txt  (also attached to this message).  A component of the attack - making wget download a .wgetrc first - was described here:   but there are also new tricks: the HTTP to FTP redirect, and the use of post_file to make wget POST a file from the server with the cron job.
