Especially the num_to_read variable in yy_get_next_buffer is critical, because the buffer is resized if this value is _less_ or equal to zero.  With special crafted input it is possible, that the buffer is not resized if the input is larger than the default buffer size of 16k. This allows a heap buffer overflow.  It may be also remote usable, it depends on the software that is build using flex. We noticed for example, that bogofilter segfaults sometimes depending on the incoming mail.   Upstream already noticed that this may be a problem[2] but did not escalate it as a security issue. Upstream also changed some other type back from size_t to int (for example in [3]) so maybe it is not sufficient to only change num_to_read back to int.  The upstream fix is contained in but there are more integer type fixes in the master branch of flex (currently not in a released version).   As the issue is in the generated code during compile time, it is not sufficient to fix flex, but all binaries using flex as build-dependency may need a rebuild after fixing flex. Additinally there may be packages, that supply the generated source in the release-tar and do not use flex during building.   Could you please assign a CVE for this issue?
