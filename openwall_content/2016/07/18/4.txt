I thought it was just lacking detail in message body, which is against oss-security list content guidelines:  http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security#list-content-guidelines  "At least the most essential part of your message (e.g., vulnerability detail or a PoC exploit) should in fact be in the message itself (and in plain text), rather than only included by reference to an external resource.  Posting links to relevant external resources as well is acceptable, but posting only links is not."  So I thought I'd just point out this to you like I do now (but off-list), for further occasions.  However, as it turns out the URL says "You are not authorized to access bug To see this bug, you must first log in to an account with the appropriate permissions." and the other URL is lacking direct detail on the bug as well (only talking about the fix).  BTW, is it one vulnerability or more?  You wrote "vulnerabilities".  Please post the detail in a "reply" to this message, and please include detail (not only URLs) in your postings going forward.  This last request/reminder applies to everyone posting to oss-security.
