I've retested the current "VeraCrypt Setup on a fully patched Windows 7, and it is STILL (or AGAIN) vulnerable there.  The following DLLs are loaded from the "application directory" and their DllMain() executed: VSSAPI.dll, ATL.dll, VSSTrace.dll.  See and for details about this well-known and well-documented beginner's error!  Due to the application manifest embedded in the executable installer which specifies "requireAdministrator" the installer is run with administrative privileges ("protected" administrators are prompted for consent, unprivileged standard users are prompted for an administrator password); execution of the DLLs therefore results in an escalation of privilege!  For software downloaded with a web browser the "application directory" is typically the user's "Downloads" directory: see and for prior art!   Mitigation: ~~~~~~~~~~~  DUMP executable installers, build packages for the target OS' native installer instead!  See <http://home.arcor.de/skanthak/!execute.html> as well as <http://home.arcor.de/skanthak/sentinel.html> for the long sad story of these vulnerabilities.   stay tuned Stefan Kanthak   Timeline: ~~~~~~~~~     vulnerability report sent to author     author confirmed vulnerability, got                worked with author until he finally was able to build               an installer which didn't show this vulnerability.                Also notified author:               "as soon as Microsoft introduces new/other dependencies                between Windows' system DLLs or refactors them (again)                this vulnerability will VERY likely resurface again."     report published by author (see above)     vulnerability report sent to author ("I told you so!")
