Find a device running a libupnp based server (Shodan says there's rather a lot), and POST a file to /testfile. Then GET /testfile" "…and yeah if the server is running as root (it is) and is using / as the web root (probably not, but maybe) this gives full host fs access"  And later on: "Emailed the Debian security team a couple of months ago, no response"  Not good...
