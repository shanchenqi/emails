Here's a two line summary:      -     RFC (CGI) puts the HTTP Proxy header from a request into the    environment variables as HTTP_PROXY      -     HTTP_PROXY is a popular environment variable used to configure an    outgoing proxy   The consequence is that an attacker can force a proxy of their choice to be used. This proxy receives the full request for anything sent over HTTP using a vulnerable client. It can also act in a malicious way to tie up server resources (a "reverse slowloris").  For the purposes of general disclosure to the wider ecosystem, we've prepared a website that describes the issue and collects common mitigations: https://httpoxy.org/ - but I'll continue with some notes below.  Particularly affected is anything using the Guzzle HTTP library for PHP, but also many other languages and frameworks when deployed under 'real' CGI (PHP's userspace is basically emulated CGI), including Go's net/http and Python's requests. This bug appears to be more than 15 years old, and was fixed in a piecemeal fashion in other software (e.g. curl, libwww-perl, Ruby).  The good news, however, is that stripping any Proxy request header is easy (because it is undefined by IETF and not listed in IANA's registry of message headers) - there should be no standard use for the header at all.  Over the past two weeks, we've disclosed to the language teams affected (PHP, Python, Go, HHVM), as well as common CGI implementation vendors (Nginx, Apache). CERT have been involved in this process, and weâve had the help of the Red Hat Product Security team. All these teams will probably have good advisories for their own specific affected software.  The Apache Software Foundation have an advisory available at https://www.apache.org/security/asf-httpoxy-response.txt  The original discovery in seems to have been by Randal L. Schwartz. discovery was made by Scott Geary, research and disclosure co-ordinated by Dominic Scheirlinck, colleagues of mine.
