Thanks for your review -- Play is proactive about security, but does rely on the integrity of the browser to implement key security features (CORS, Same Origin Policy, security headers, etc) for that functionality.  Regarding your other questions, Play Framework ("Play" for short) is an open source project -- the source code is owned and licensed by Lightbend.  You can read more about it here:  https://www.playframework.com/community-process#Implementation-decisions  For reference, there is a mailing list for reporting vulnerabilities at security@...yframework.org.  The mailing list for receiving Play Framework security announcements is at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/play-framework-security  And the HTML page for viewing Play security advisories reports is at https://www.playframework.com/security/vulnerability  Thanks, Will Sargent Lightbend, Play Team     Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
