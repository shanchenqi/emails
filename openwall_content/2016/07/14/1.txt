However only one CVE was assigned to multiple issues as per   Looking a bit into the attached bug and going a few links down, i realized that there are atleast 3 issues in here which are CVE worthy. Details as follows:  1. Heap based buffer overflow:  2. Fix hmtx wrong table length check:  3. heap-buffer-overflow in hb_ot_face_metrics_accelerator_t::get_advance  Can MITRE please assign CVEs to these issues?  Also, assuming we still have a policy of one issue one CVE, how does MITRE plan to handle vendors who assign one CVE to multiple non-related issues?
