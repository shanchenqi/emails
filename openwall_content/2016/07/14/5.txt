These have all been fixed now.  Attached are source files for each issue that include a full writeup of the issue, links to the patches, as well as a PoC to demonstrate the issue. We are requesting CVEs for all but the last issue (which is root-only). The following list contains brief description of each issue, ordered from highest to lowest severity.  mmap_panic: Malicious calls to mmap() can trigger an allocation panic or trigger memory corruption. kevent_panic: Any user can panic the kernel with the kevent system call. thrsleep_panic: Any user can panic the kernel with the __thrsleep system call. thrsigdivert_panic: Any user can panic the kernel with the __thrsigdivert system call. ufs_getdents_panic: Any user can panic the kernel with the getdents system call. mount_panic: Root users, or users on systems with kern.usermount set to true, can trigger a kernel panic when mounting a tmpfs filesystem. unmount_panic: Root users, or users on systems with kern.usermount set to true, can trigger a kernel panic when unmounting a filesystem. tmpfs_mknod_panic: Root can panic kernel with mknod on a tmpfs filesystem.  Errata have been issued which cover some of these issues on http://www.openbsd.org/errata59.html <http://www.openbsd.org/errata59.html> and http://www.openbsd.org/errata58.html <http://www.openbsd.org/errata58.html>.  NCC Group would like to thank the OpenBSD development team for clear communication and a quick turnaround on these issues.
