Description:  Messaging applications using the Proton C library to provide SSL/TLS authentication on Windows can falsely authenticate a server whose name does not match the server name in the connection specifier.  Proton C bindings are affected to a greater or lesser degree depending on how they use the underlying Proton C library.  In Proton C, this can only happen if PN_SSL_VERIFY_PEER_NAME has been specified as the verification mode and pn_ssl_set_peer_hostname() has not been called at all or has been called with a NULL value for a particular pn_ssl_t object.  In the Proton C++ binding, this will always happen unless the application has separately specified a virtual_host name for an SSL/TLS connection.  In the Proton Python and Ruby bindings, this will only happen if the application has separately specified a NULL virtual_host name for an SSL/TLS connection after creating the connection but before the authentication step.  This issue only occurs on Windows versions of Proton that use the default SChannel-based security layer.  In any of the preceding cases, it is possible for a man-in-the-middle attacker to spoof an SSL/TLS server if they had a certificate that was valid for any of the application's Certificate Authorities.  Resolution:  Proton release resolves this issue in the SChannel-based security layer by obtaining a default non-NULL peer hostname from the associated connection address when initialized and by always failing hostname verification if PN_SSL_VERIFY_PEER_NAME has been specified along with a NULL peer hostname.  This resolution matches the associated behaviour of the OpenSSL-based security layer.
