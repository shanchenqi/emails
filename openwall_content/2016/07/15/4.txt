We think additional information would help in deciding whether this is commonly recognized as a Play Framework vulnerability (which would have a CVE ID) or Play Framework security hardening (which would not have a CVE ID). Our understanding thus far is:    - Play Framework is not an Atlassian product    -     says "In order to make Play's CSRF filter more resilient to     browser plugin vulnerabilities and new extensions, the default     configuration for the CSRF filter has been made far more     conservative."    - Chromium issue has some debate about whether it is a     Chrome/Chromium vulnerability, e.g., "The issue is whether it's     the browser responsibility to act as a nanny to weak websites, or     we should leave weak websites as sacrifice for great justice."     versus "To be clear, this is a security bug ... There is a     security bug in Chrome, but no action is being done."  Typically, it would be best not to have a CVE for Play Framework if the essence of the Play Framework problem is "the product did not proactively add workarounds for all browser-level vulnerabilities that might be discovered later."  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =RxGV -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
