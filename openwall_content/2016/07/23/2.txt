Impact:      This remotely accessible vulnerability is always reproducible and     possibly works in any version before and     An attacker can supply java script code in the filename of an     uploaded file, which will be executed in browsers of other users. It     is not     required to open this file. Browsing into the folder will trigger     the code execution.  Exploit:    * log in   * open a folder you can upload a file to   * select the "upload files"-dialog   * drop a random file in   * write code (e.g. JavaScript) in the filename   * upload file      From this moment the code will run on any user's web browser who     opens the folder you uploaded the file in.
