The vulnerability allows an attacker to specify a negative index into the file-content buffer and copy data from that position until the end of the buffer.  This will allow an attacker to crash the process by accessing unmapped memory and (depending on how LibTIFF is used) might also allow an attacker to leak sensitive information.  The issue is fixed in CVS HEAD with the commit:  revision date:  author: erouault;  state: Exp;  lines: +6 -3;  commitid: YhOZoKv5OA9gNNdz; * libtiff/tif_read.c: Fix out-of-bounds read on memory-mapped files in TIFFReadRawStrip1() and TIFFReadRawTile1() when stripoffset is beyond tmsize_t max value (reported by Mathias Svensson)   Kinds regards, Mathias Svensson Google Security Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
