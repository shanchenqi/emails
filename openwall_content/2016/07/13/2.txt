The flaws are in the ecryptfs-setup-swap script that is provided by the upstream ecryptfs-utils project. The script can be used to convert an existing, unencrypted swap partition into a swap partition that is encrypted. System admins may use this tool and the Ubuntu installer uses it when the user opts into home directory encryption.  On systems using systemd or newer and GPT partitioning, the unencrypted swap partition was being automatically activated during boot and the encrypted swap was not used. This was due to ecryptfs-setup-swap not marking the swap partition as "no-auto", as defined by the Discoverable Partitions Spec:   https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/DiscoverablePartitionsSpec/  Details of the two issues needing CVEs:  ecryptfs-setup-swap improperly configures encrypted swap when using GPT partitioning Bug: Fix: (Please ignore the inaccurate commit message for commit  ecryptfs-setup-swap improperly configures encrypted swap when using GPT partitioning on a NVMe or MMC drive.
