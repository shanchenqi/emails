When using KNewStuff, one of the KDE Frameworks, to download and install files  from the internet (e.g. a wallpaper, a plasma applet, etc.), it was possible  to download a maliciously crafted archive file (e.g. tar.gz or zip) containing  relative paths leading to outside the extraction directory (say  "../../../.bashrc" for instance).  The fix has already been reviewed and submitted:    This fix is one layer below KNewStuff, in the framework called KArchive, which  handles extraction of .tar.gz / .zip archives. KArchive now prevents files from  being written outside of the extraction directory, in all cases.  Versions up to KArchive are affected, the fix is in KArchive  which I released a week ago.  To my knowledge, no CVE has been requested for this yet, but to make sure, you  could check if someone else from kde-security emailed you in the past month  already (issue known since June 14, sorry for the delay on my part).  Thanks.  --  David Faure, faure@....org, http://www.davidfaure.fr Working on KDE Frameworks 5   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
