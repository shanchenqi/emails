Apply this same > standard to the "." fallback directory.    The covering commits seem to be:  Change the temporary directory search algorithm on unix so that directories with only -wx permission are allowed. And do not allow "." to be returned if it lacks -wx permission.   Fix the fix to the temporary directory search algorithm so that it continues to return "." as a fallback if that directory has the correct permissions.   Fix the temporary directory search algorithm for unix so that it fails gracefully even if all candidate directories are inaccessible. This fixes a bug that was introduced by check-in   Can a CVE please be assigned for this issue?
