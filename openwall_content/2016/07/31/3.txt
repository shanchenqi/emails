Not really, that device just acts like the USB device it said it is (a keyboard).  This device has been around for years and is very useful for development efforts.  >     1.

So can your USB keyboard :)  Anyway, Linux (the kernel), provides you the abilities to disable all USB devices and only enable the ones you deem "safe", whenever you decide to.  It is up to you how you determine this.  By default, most Linux distros do not enable this option for obvious reasons.  > Note that by default - Linux's firewall is disabled, therefore > allowing an easy access to the attacker via internet.  No, that's your distro's decision, many enable it by default.  Anyway, best of luck, but this is a distro-specific issue and I suggest working with your distro to enable that option by default if you so desire it.  thanks,  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
