It has been patched in upstream here:    For OSS-sec:  attached is a PoC. I attempted to write an exploit for this but that's not really my forte. I feel like this bug has the potential for a workable user->root exploit but I couldn't do it.  1: You can control which cache the overflow happens on. I picked the same cache as the File struct. 2: the code writes 2 different width zeros past the allocation, one 32 bit and the other 64 bit. 3: I attempted to overflow and write the 32 bit 0 to the top half of a pointer so it would point to userland, but I couldn't find a suitable structure to overflow into.  So if anyone plays around with this and gets a workable exploit please share the details as I'm looking to expand my exploitation knowledge, and techniques.
