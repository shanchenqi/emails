I have tested openswan and strongswan and confirmed it contains the same amplification that is inherent in being IKEv1 compliant.  Neither implementation has applied the hardening that libreswan has applied for this that was the original information that caused to be issued for libreswan.  I believe MITRE needs to fix the inconsistency in the issuance of expand it to be about the IKEv1 protocol, and gather the other vendor information and patches, or issue additional vendor specific CVE's. I believe the first solution is better.  Paul  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
