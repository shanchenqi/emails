While analyzing the issue[2], it turns out that the issue is actually in XSLoader, which uses caller() information to locate the .so file to load. This can be incorrect if XSLoader::load() is called in a string eval. The fix commited upstream is [3].  @MITRE: Could you please assign a CVE for this issue in XSLoader? Do you think List::MoreUtils needs a separate CVE as well, despite the underlying issue lying in XSLoader[4]?
