The opening e-mail states that IKEv2 is not believed to be affected, I can confirm that in some cases some implementations are indeed affected.  There was some doubts about IKEv2 being affected and I was contacted by a Cisco engineer as well as one of the RFC authors, we constructed multiple IKEv2 probe payloads and did a series of secondary scans that specifically targeted IKEv2 hosts to confirm these results.  Where hosts should respond once based on IKEv2 RFC specs, hundreds of thousands reply multiple times, roughly reply 21 times or more per single probe, some of the worst offenders responded thousands of times.
