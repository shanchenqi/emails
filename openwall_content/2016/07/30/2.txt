FYI, this patch had some unintended side effects:  They replaced GMP's mpz_powm with mpz_powm_sec, however the latter is not equivalent. It requires odd moduli and will crash with a floating point exception if the modulus is even.  This is actually a bug class that may turn out to be interesting, I recently experienced something very similar (but more severe) in matrixssl (writeup on that will follow as soon as I find time for it). Bignum libraries have certain conditions on how their input is formed and don't behave well if the input isn't what they expect. These conditions usually make sense in the average use case, but not neccessarily if an attacker can control some of the input.   --  Hanno Bรถck https://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
