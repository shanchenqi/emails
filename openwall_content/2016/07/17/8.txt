Is there a particular motivation for having a CVE ID? We don't know of anyone who is shipping products based on unreleased HarfBuzz code obtained from GitHub, and the one-day existence of the problematic code also seems to suggest minimal real-world relevance. The HarfBuzz documentation doesn't specifically recommend that people ship unreleased HarfBuzz code. A CVE ID isn't, in general, required for each issue noted at any arbitrary point during development.  Would it be OK to keep for (which is really a "before issue as stated in that CVE), and assign one new ID for (the "before issue)?  > how does > MITRE plan to handle vendors who assign one CVE to multiple non-related > issues?  Anyone is free to submit new CVE ID requests with sufficient information to show that additional IDs are required. Typically this means that the requester should, for example, track down all of the upstream version information.  In general, it is not realistic to expect that the "multiple non-related issues" case can be completely eliminated when CVE IDs are originally assigned. When product A repackages code from product B, there can be a disparity in whether the B maintainers are as interested in CVE as the A maintainers. Also, the A maintainers do not necessarily have any motivation for investigating the precise details of what was fixed in B, unless the A maintainers are backporting patches. For example, A might just be updating to the latest version of B, because the B Release Notes stated that it was a security update. Suppose that the A maintainers confirm that the B maintainers have not been, and will not be, using CVE IDs themselves. Would it be better for the A maintainers to use one CVE ID immediately, or should everyone wait (potentially forever) for someone to investigate the precise details?  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =QsMP -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
