A bunch of implementations just copy the incoming header to construct the outgoing header. You can detect this by sending an bogus IKEv3 packet and see if they reply the same to that.  Can you confirm your test actually got a valid IKE_INIT reply that was re-send multiple times? If so, can you detect the vendor behind it? I can probably help fingerprint that to determine.
