In the past year+ I've been dealing with CVE assignment and the PHP project. During this period we managed to work closer with the Linux distributions and also to improve the internal process regarding CVE requests.  I've blogged about a recent problem I encountered with is request and assignment of CVE for issues almost a year old without any public info about this ("anonymous requests"). Meaning that me, being part of upstream (incl. the security team), don't even know we've got CVE assigned and can update things on our side (and also other relevant upstreams such as libgd).  More details at  I'll be happy to be referred to the right forum to further discuss this. Till then, I hope you'll take these remakes into consideration, so the whole eco system could work more smoothly.
