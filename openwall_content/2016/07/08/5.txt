There is not currently a separate CVE for List::MoreUtils. As far as we can tell, the "Sun Jul 03 section of gives possible reasons for List::MoreUtils to be fixed independently, but doesn't directly argue that List::MoreUtils was responsible for a vulnerability on its own. Actually, it might imply the opposite, with the "Even if List::MoreUtils is not at fault, I think this patch is helpful" wording.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  T5OSd5vKksMXgbMqIKIi =NaWX -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
