I'm not requesting on behalf of the Inverse team ("from by own perspective"). Inverse already confirmed the issues (and fixed most of them), but SOGo has a history of missing CVEs even for nasty issues.    > Going through the list of public issues: >  > SOGo - is the ultimate case of the entire issue summarized by > "copies the attachment (into memcached?) and then eliminates the copy > in the sogod.

The issues was resolved by limiting the upload size, which _also_ was a feature request (but now got important due to the possible DOS attack). Further investigation showed that not memcached was the issue but temporary files kept around, but the rest of the argument stayed the same.   > SOGo is listed twice but the second one has in the URL.

Not all private information removed for the public free/busy view 2. It was possible to join appointments based on the UID of the public free/busy view from different users, to know who has appointments with whom   > SOGo has two identical > "Issue: lines.

The (now public) issue log says I realized the issue also exists with contacts, and the CSS stuff was not an additional attack vector, but a regression fix.   --  Jens Erat UniversitĂ¤t Konstanz Kommunikations-, Infomations-, Medienzentrum (KIM) Abteilung Basisdienste Konstanz Mail: jens.erat@...-konstanz.de     Download attachment "smime.p7s" of type "application/pkcs7-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
