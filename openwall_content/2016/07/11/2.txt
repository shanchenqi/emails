If the next EBR starts at relative offset 0, parse_dos_extended() will loop until running out of memory. An attacker could install a specially crafted MSDOS partition table in a storage device and trick a user into using it. This library is used, among others, by systemd-udevd daemon.  Upstream patch: libblkid: ignore extended partition at zero offset  Impact: Low CVSS3 scoring : AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:H/RL:U/RC:C  Reported by: Christian Moch & Michael Gruhn  Best Regards,  --  Cedric Buissart, Product Security   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
