Until now, tools I checked are protected either by detecting the loop (i.e.: actively searching for a relative offset of 0 for the next EBR, as done by this util-linux patch; partprobe and fdisk are doing that), or enforcing a limit on the maximum number of partitions for a device (Linux kernel, kpartx & other tools I currently checked)  > > > -- > Hanno Bรถck > https://hboeck.de/ > > mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de > GPG: >    --  Cedric Buissart, Product Security   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
