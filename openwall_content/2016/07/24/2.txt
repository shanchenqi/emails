What we will do for now is assign one CVE ID for the "ICU for C/C++" product and a separate CVE ID for PHP. In other words, the bug discoverer has indicated that it is a bug in that ICU product. However, it is a bug at a different level within the PHP distribution, because implies that PHP is intended to operate safely even with an unpatched copy of the ICU library.  Use for ICU for C/C++.  Use for PHP.  (If there happens to be further information indicating that uloc_acceptLanguageFromHTTP was supposed to be using the tmp array as originally written, then we can reject   > (Use After Free Vulnerability in SNMP with GC and > unserialize()).

(The same CVE ID applies to the copy of the code that is shipped in the PHP distribution.)  (Incidentally, although MITRE cannot be a vulnerability coordinator for this issue, we noticed that UTC]" comment in seems to refer to a different product. The mentioned http://gggeek.github.io/phpxmlrpc/ page says "This is also not the library which can be compiled as a php extension and has been bundled with php since version and links to http://xmlrpc-epi.sourceforge.net/ to point out that it is NOT that codebase. See also the https://sourceforge.net/p/xmlrpc-epi/git/ci/master/tree/AUTHORS page.)   > (Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in > php_stream_zip_opener).
