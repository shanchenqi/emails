Accordingly, there are no other CVE IDs at this time.  refers to "sf - in other words,       Among the concerns cited is "POSIX mandates that yyleng has type int, but flex defines it as yy_size_t. This breaks programs that use the POSIX-compatible declaration." The MITRE CVE team has not been studying or the mentioned master-branch commits - the only point is that integer types sometimes need to be changed without a security-related motivation.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =YRxV -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
