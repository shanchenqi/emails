ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The PV pagetable code has fast-paths for making updates to pre-existing pagetable entries, to skip expensive re-validation in safe cases (e.g. clearing only Access/Dirty bits).  The bits considered safe were too broad, and not actually safe.  IMPACT ======  A malicous PV guest administrator can escalate their privilege to that of the host.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All versions of Xen are vulnerable.  The vulnerability is only exposed to PV guests on x86 hardware.  The vulnerability is not exposed to x86 HVM guests, or ARM guests.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only HVM guests will avoid this vulnerability.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Jérémie Boutoille of Quarkslab.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            xen-unstable, Xen 4.7.x       Xen 4.6.x       Xen 4.5.x, 4.4.x, 4.3.x  $    $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
