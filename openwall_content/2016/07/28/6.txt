They seem all  reads off the free'd structure.  I see in the bug report: " (I think use after free's can be serious and  potentially lead to malfunction and security issues)" and would like to  understand more about the rationale.               -  twiz   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
