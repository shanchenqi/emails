As far as we can tell, this is being presented as a vulnerability in Redis, not a vulnerability in Linenoise. https://github.com/antirez/linenoise/blob/master/README.markdown says "A minimal, zero-config, BSD licensed, readline replacement used in Redis, MongoDB, and Android." Because it has a "minimal" design goal, it seems reasonable to argue that the linenoiseHistorySave function itself should not be making umask changes, because it cannot know whether history elements are potentially sensitive information within an arbitrary application that uses Linenoise. Also, the "History" section of README.markdown says "Linenoise has direct support for persisting the history into an history file. The functions linenoiseHistorySave and linenoiseHistoryLoad do just that. Both functions return -1 on error and 0 on success." It does not offer any guidance about whether this is typically safe.  Admittedly, there is a counterargument that command history is always sensitive information, and that the design of the linenoiseHistorySave function is fundamentally wrong. We are not currently using that perspective for CVE ID assignments. (Also, suggests that there isn't a huge amount of affected code.)  Use for the Redis vulnerability.  If there are other issues (such as in the report) that also need CVE IDs, please send a message about the others. Separate CVE IDs are also useful for host-based vulnerability scanning, e.g., a vulnerability check for a readable ~/.rediscli_history file completely covers A check for a readable ~/.dbshell file (if that is indeed a vulnerability) would map to a different CVE ID.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  qEIvs2HrpjkHZZxW5NMN =Xa5w -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
