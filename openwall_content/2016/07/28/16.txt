We would need someone to contribute additional risk analysis before we would assign a CVE ID. We realize that says "It provides both a stand alone command line tool as well as a library." The https://sourceforge.net/p/paps/code/ci/master/tree/src/ code has the library (in libpaps.c) whereas the https://github.com/dov/paps code does not. In any case, is about a buffer under-read in the read_file function, which is only called from main (not called from any library code). Also, the patch is apparently only about handling empty files, not about handling any other type of crafted file. If the user runs the command-line program on an empty file, a "heap-buffer-overflow ... READ of size 1" occurs when trying to read the last character of the file to determine if it's a \n character. To avoid this impact, the user can simply stop running paps on empty files.  Because we don't see any other risk, we are not providing a CVE ID at this time.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  YhpgVbqRajNuWJco7FBh =Q5EF -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
