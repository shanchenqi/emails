It could occur if a guest kernel running under hypervisor-mode KVM  (i.e. "HV KVM" rather than "PR KVM"), does the H_CEDE hypercall while a  suspended transaction exists, the host CPU may, under certain circumstances,  hang in an infinite loop with interrupts disabled.  A user/process inside guest could use this flaw to crash the host kernel  resulting in DoS.
