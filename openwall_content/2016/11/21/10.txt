Well formed requests are easy and fast to process. Poorly formed requests take more time (I'm not speaking about these WordPress issues in specific, but more in general terms).  We (MITRE and the CVE board as well as efforts like the DWF) are also making significant changes to CVE, how they are assigned, CNAs, federation, the technology and more that should result in much easier and faster assignments.  Also there are problems with OVE, for example what counting rules does it use? Where is the database of data? To be honest OVE is a nice idea, but falls very short of what people need from a vulnerability identifier.
