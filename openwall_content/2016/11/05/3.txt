It was tested in libxml (ArchLinux To reproduce:  $ xmllint --recover crash-libxml2-recover.xml  AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address (pc bp sp T0)     #0 in xmlDumpElementContent     #1 in xmlDumpElementContent     #2 in xmlDumpElementDecl     #3 in xmlBufDumpElementDecl     #4 in xmlNodeDumpOutputInternal     #5 in xmlNodeListDumpOutput     #6 in xmlDtdDumpOutput     #7 in xmlNodeDumpOutputInternal     #8 in xmlDocContentDumpOutput     #9 in xmlSaveDoc     #10 in parseAndPrintFile     #11 in main     #12 in __libc_start_main     #13 in _start   A reproducer is attached. It is interesting to note that the developers of libxml2 strongly recommend not to use recover mode to parse untrusted inputs. Please assign a CVE if suitable.  Regards, Gustavo.
