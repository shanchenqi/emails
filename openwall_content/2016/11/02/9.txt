Internally, even if this function would be made to allocate a unscape destination buffer larger than 2GB, it would return that new length in a signed 32 bit integer variable, thus the length would get either just truncated or both truncated and turned negative. That could then lead to libcurl writing outside of its heap based buffer.  This can be triggered by a user on a 64bit system if the user can send in a custom (very large) URL to a libcurl using program.  We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.  INFO ----  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name to this issue.  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  This flaw exists in the following curl versions  - Affected versions: curl to and including - Not affected versions: curl < and curl >=  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!  THE SOLUTION ------------  In version the parser function is fixed.  A [patch for is available.  RECOMMENDATIONS ---------------  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:    A - Upgrade curl and libcurl to version    B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild  TIME LINE ---------  It was first reported to the curl project on September 23 by Cure53.  We contacted distros@...nwall on October 19.  curl was released on November 2 coordinated with the publication of this advisory.  CREDITS -------  his vulnerability was found during a Secure Open Source audit performed by Cure53.  --     / daniel.haxx.se  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
