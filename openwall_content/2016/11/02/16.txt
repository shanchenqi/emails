Can this be used to trick users or give malicious actors an advantage? I think  yes. I think it has a security impact. To what extent can be debated, but then  I don't grade our security vulnerabilites.  > I guess many upstreams should be explicitly made aware of that soon.

Since and make clients end up on different  target machines, there's no doubt in my mind that this *can* be abused. I'm  confident that many other tools and libraries in addition to curl have the  same problem.  > I reported the "Ă" issue and the lack of IDNA support in cURL on Sun,  > 18 May directly to you, but I didn't classify it as a  > security related issue though... ;-)  Then I appologize for having dropped the ball and not having seen the problem  correctly back then. I don't remember that occasion, but I believe you.  NOTE: the IDNA fix seems to be incomplete [1] so right now it is probably  better to just disable IDN support in curl, at least if libidn2 powered.
