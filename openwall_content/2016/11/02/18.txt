StackGuard used a fixed canary value: CR LF 0xFF. This was based on the observation that most unsafe stack buffer manipulations were from string operations, and most string-handling functions would trip up on at least one of these values, making it difficult to write the canary with the functions that were used.   I suspect the leading here is for much the same reason, to trip up string writing operations more than string reading.
