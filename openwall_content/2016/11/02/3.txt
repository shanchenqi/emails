This means that if an unused connection with proper credentials exists for a protocol that has connection-scoped credentials, an attacker can cause that connection to be reused if s/he knows the case-insensitive version of the correct password.  We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.  INFO ----  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name to this issue.  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  This flaw exists in the following curl versions.  - Affected versions: curl 7.7 to and including - Not affected versions: curl < 7.7 and curl >=  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!  THE SOLUTION ------------  In version these functions will deny negative string lengths from being used.  A [patch for is available.  RECOMMENDATIONS ---------------  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:    A - Upgrade curl and libcurl to version    B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild  TIME LINE ---------  It was first reported to the curl project on September 23 by Cure53.  We contacted distros@...nwall on October 19.  curl was released on November 2 coordinated with the publication of this advisory.  CREDITS -------  This vulnerability was found during a Secure Open Source audit performed by Cure53.  --     / daniel.haxx.se  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
