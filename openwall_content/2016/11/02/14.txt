From my point of view, this especially affects GNU libc for example.  On the other hand, I am wondering if this should be really classified as a security related issue. Being interested in IDNA support myself, I did some IDNA patches in the past, but practically IDNA support is still not that widespread as I would wish. Does using an older standard (as in IDNA really classify this issue as a security related one? If so, I guess many upstreams should be explicitly made aware of that soon. Maybe MITRE (or somebody else) could share their thoughts about this, too?  > It was first reported to the curl project on October 11 by Christian Heimes.  I reported the "Ă" issue and the lack of IDNA support in cURL on Sun, 18 May directly to you, but I didn't classify it as a security related issue though... ;-)   Greetings,   Robert  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
