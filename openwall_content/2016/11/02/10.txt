When cookies to be sent to a server are collected, the matching function collects all cookies to send and the cookie lock is released immediately afterwards. That funcion however only returns a list with *references* back to the original strings for name, value, path and so on. Therefore, if another thread quickly takes the lock and frees one of the original cookie structs together with its strings, a use-after-free can occur and lead to information disclosure. Another thread can also replace the contents of the cookies from separate HTTP responses or API calls.  We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.  INFO ----  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name to this issue.  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  This flaw exists in the following curl versions:  - Affected versions: curl to and including - Not affected versions: curl < and curl >=  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!  THE SOLUTION ------------  In version the function returning the cookies make deep copies.  A [patch for is available.  RECOMMENDATIONS ---------------  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:    A - Upgrade curl and libcurl to version    B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild    C - Do not share cookies between threads  TIME LINE ---------  It was first reported to the curl project on September 23 by Cure53.  We contacted distros@...nwall on October 19.  curl was released on November 2 coordinated with the publication of this advisory.  CREDITS -------  his vulnerability was found during a Secure Open Source audit performed by Cure53.  --     / daniel.haxx.se  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
