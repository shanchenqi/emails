When reading one of the length fields from the socket, it fails to ensure that the length parameter passed to realloc() is not set to 0.  This would lead to realloc() getting called with a zero size and when doing so realloc() returns NULL *and* frees the memory - in contrary to normal realloc() fails where it only returns NULL - causing libcurl to free the memory *again* in the error path.  This flaw could be triggered by a malicious or just otherwise ill-behaving server.  We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.  INFO ----  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name to this issue.  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  This flaw exists in the following curl versions  - Affected versions: curl 7.3 to and including - Not affected versions: curl < 7.3 and curl >=  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!  THE SOLUTION ------------  In version the function reading data will consider reading a zero size to be an error and bail out.  A [patch for is available.  RECOMMENDATIONS ---------------  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:    A - Upgrade curl and libcurl to version    B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild    C - Do not use KRB5  TIME LINE ---------  It was first reported to the curl project on September 23 by Cure53.  We contacted distros@...nwall on October 19.  curl was released on November 2 coordinated with the publication of this advisory.  CREDITS -------  This vulnerability was found during a Secure Open Source audit performed by Cure53.  --     / daniel.haxx.se  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
