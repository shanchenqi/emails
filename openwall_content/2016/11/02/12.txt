This misalignment causes problems with for example domains using the German Ă character (known as the Unicode Character 'LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S') which is used at times in the .de TLD and is translated differently in the two IDNA standards, leading to users potentially and unknowingly issuing network transfer requests to the wrong host.  For example, `straĂe.de` is translated into `strasse.de` using IDNA but is translated into `xn--strae-oqa.de` using IDNA Needless to say, those host names could very well resolve to different addresses and be two completely independent servers. IDNA is mandatory for .de domains.  curl is not alone with this problem, as there's currently a big flux in the world of network user-agents about which IDNA version to support and use.  This name problem exists for DNS-using protocols in curl, but only when built to use libidn.  We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.  INFO ----  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name to this issue.  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  This flaw exists in the following curl versions.  - Affected versions: curl to and including - Not affected versions: curl < and curl >=  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!  THE SOLUTION ------------  In version the parser function is fixed.  A [patch for is available.  RECOMMENDATIONS ---------------  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:    A - Upgrade curl and libcurl to version    B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild  TIME LINE ---------  It was first reported to the curl project on October 11 by Christian Heimes.  We contacted distros@...nwall on October 19.  curl was released on November 2 coordinated with the publication of this advisory.
