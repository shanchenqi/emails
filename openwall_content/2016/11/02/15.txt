Ambiguitiy in character encodings can often be a source of security issues.  Just think of the following: * A Certificate Authority is using different pieces of software that   mix different IDNA encodings. * I request a certificate for strasse.de, but the verification mail   goes to xn--strae-oqa.de. * I am the owner of xn--strae-oqa.de and now have a valid certificate   for strasse.de.  IMHO the whole idea of suddenly changing how international domain names are encoded is a very problematic security violation.  --  Hanno Bรถck https://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
