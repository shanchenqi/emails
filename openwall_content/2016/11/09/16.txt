Thanks.  Description: libming is a Flash (SWF) output library. It can be used from PHP, Perl, Ruby,  Python, C, C++, Java, and probably more on the way..  A fuzzing revealed a left shift in listmp3. The bug does not reside in any  shared object but if you have a web application that calls directly the  listmp3 binary to parse untrusted mp3, then you are affected.  The complete UBSan output:  # listmp3 $FILE runtime error: left shift of negative value -1 runtime error: left shift of negative value -1  Affected version:  Fixed version: N/A  Commit fix: N/A  Credit: This bug was discovered by Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo.  CVE: N/A  Reproducer:  Timeline: bug discovered bug reported to upstream blog post about the issue  Note: This bug was found with American Fuzzy Lop.
