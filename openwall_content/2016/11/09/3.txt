The fimg2d which is one of the graphic devices for Exynos chipsets doesnât have exception control routines to handle unexpected commands and it can lead to kernel panic. The patch prevents kernel panic by ignoring inappropriate commands at the state.  Use After Free in /dev/fimg2d Severity: Medium Affected versions: All devices with Exynos chipsets Reported on: August 5, Disclosure status: Privately disclosed. A use-after-free vulnerability in fimg2d allows attackers to gain access to unauthorized data. The patch with error handling was applied.
