Thanks.  Description: jasper is an open-source initiative to provide a free software-based reference  implementation of the codec specified in the Part-1 standard.  A crafted image, maybe posted in the past as testcase for another bug, causes  in the version a use-after-free. No fuzzers involved at this time.
