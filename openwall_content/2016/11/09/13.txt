Thanks.  Description: libtiff is a software that provides support for the Tag Image File Format  (TIFF).  During the fuzz of imagemagick, I noticed a memory allocation failure in  libtiff. The issue was first reported to the imagemagickâs developers which  confirmed that the issue resides in libtiff instead of imagemagick.  The complete ASan output:  # identify $FILE AddressSanitizer failed to allocate  bytes of LargeMmapAllocator (error code: 12) memory map follows:           /usr/bin/magick           /usr/bin/magick
