Thanks.  Description: libming is a Flash (SWF) output library. It can be used from PHP, Perl, Ruby,  Python, C, C++, Java, and probably more on the way..  A fuzzing revealed a divide by zero in listmp3. The bug does not reside in any  shared object but if you have a web application that calls directly the  listmp3 binary to parse untrusted mp3, then you are affected.  The complete ASan output:  # listmp3 $FILE ASAN:DEADLYSIGNAL ================================================================= AddressSanitizer: FPE on unknown address (pc  bp sp T0)     #0 in printMP3Headers /var/tmp/portage/media-     #1 in main /var/tmp/portage/media-     #2 in __libc_start_main /var/tmp/portage/sys-     #3 in getenv  AddressSanitizer can not provide additional info.
