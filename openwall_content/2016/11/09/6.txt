Thanks.  Description: elfutils is a set of libraries/utilities to handle ELF objects (drop in  replacement for libelf).  During the fuzz of libdwarf, I noticed a memory allocation failure which  involves elfutils. To have a double-check, the bug was first reported to the libdwarf maintainer  and then to the elfutils maintainer. Actually there is a proposed patch on the  elfutils mailing list, but nobody commented.  The complete ASan output:  # dwarfdump $FILE AddressSanitizer failed to allocate  bytes of LargeMmapAllocator (error code: 12) memory map follows: of process memory map.
