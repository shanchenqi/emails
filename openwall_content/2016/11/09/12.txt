Thanks.  Description: libdwarf is a library to consume and produce DWARF debug information.  A fuzz on an updated version revealed a memory allocation failure.  The complete ASan output:  # dwarfdump $FILE AddressSanitizer failed to allocate bytes  allocator is terminating the process instead of  returning 0  you don't like this behavior set allocator_may_return_null=1  CHECK failed: "((0)) != (0)" (0x0, 0x0)     #0 in __asan::AsanCheckFailed(char const*, int, char const*,  unsigned long long, unsigned long long)     #1 in __sanitizer::CheckFailed(char const*, int, char const*,  unsigned long long, unsigned long long)     #2 in __sanitizer::ReportAllocatorCannotReturnNull()      #3 in   0ul, __sanitizer::SizeClassMap,  __asan::AsanMapUnmapCallback>,   0ul, __sanitizer::SizeClassMap, __asan::AsanMapUnmapCallback>  >, __sanitizer::LargeMmapAllocator >::ReturnNullOrDie() /var/tmp/portage/sys-     #4 in __asan::Allocator::Allocate(unsigned long, unsigned long,  __sanitizer::BufferedStackTrace*, __asan::AllocType, bool)      #5 in __asan::asan_malloc(unsigned long,  __sanitizer::BufferedStackTrace*)     #6 in malloc     #7 in do_decompress_zlib      #8 in _dwarf_load_section      #9 in dwarf_srcfiles      #10 in print_one_die_section      #11 in print_infos      #12 0x4faafa in process_one_file      #13 0x4faafa in main     #14 in __libc_start_main /var/tmp/portage/sys-     #15 in _start  Affected version:  Fixed version: N/A  Commit fix:  Credit: This bug was discovered by Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo.
