Thanks.  Description: elfutils is a set of libraries/utilities to handle ELF objects (drop in  replacement for libelf).  During the fuzz of libdwarf, I noticed a memory allocation failure which  involves elfutils. Actually there is a proposed patch on the elfutils mailing list, but nobody  commented.  The complete ASan output:  # dwarfdump $FILE AddressSanitizer failed to allocate  bytes of LargeMmapAllocator (error code: 12) memory map follows:           /usr/bin/dwarfdump-asan           /usr/bin/dwarfdump-asan           /usr/bin/dwarfdump-asan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         [stack]           [vvar]           [vdso]           [vsyscall] of process memory map.
