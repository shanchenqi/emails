Thanks.  Description: libming is a Flash (SWF) output library. It can be used from PHP, Perl, Ruby,  Python, C, C++, Java, and probably more on the way..  A fuzzing revealed a global buffer overflow in listmp3. The bug does not  reside in any shared object but if you have a web application that calls  directly the listmp3 binary to parse untrusted mp3, then you are affected.
