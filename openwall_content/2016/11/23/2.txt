An option max_samples has been added to the BMP and JPEG decoders to   restrict the maximum size of image that they can decode.  This change   was made as a (possibly temporary) fix to address security concerns.   ...   Some new integer overflow checks were added.   ...   Some new safe integer add/multiply functions were added.  (max_samples has a default of 64 Mb or Mb in different parts of the code.)  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =Za2r -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
