Actually when using full disk encryption, to lock the BIOS and GRUB must be mandatory, otherwise you are protecting your confidentiality but not your integrity. Even with a password in GRUB with an unprotected BIOS you can also boot from a USB device and access encrypted partitions, delete them, etc.  Just to mention another method complimentary to the "rd.shell=0" a similar behaviour to this "flaw" can be achieved using at the boot sequence "rd.break=pre-udev", this also gives you a root shell with access to the hard disk.
