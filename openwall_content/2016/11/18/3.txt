Use for the vulnerability in libgc (aka bdwgc or boehmgc).   - heap write  - global-buffer-overflow write  - https://github.com/tats/w3m/issues/7 null deref  - stack overflow  - bcopy negative size  - array index out of bound read  - null deref   > use uninit value  Use for the problem fixed by the new conditional PUSH_ENV(HTML_DL) call in file.c in  Use for the problem fixed by the new "tagname[0] = '\0'" line in parsetagx.c in   - write to rodata  - null deref  - stack overflow  - near-null deref  - near-null deref  - potential heap buffer corruption   I classify this as "moderate" because the allocator do preserve more space   than required size due to bucketing. And w3m's allocator is boehmgc, it   seems not easy replaceable. So the heap won't be corrupted in practice  - null deref  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  VkeNyH+PpwPAk5+CyOr3 =QSeZ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
