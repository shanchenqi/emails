And I find one vulnerability in libbpg, this is a double-free issue, which can lead to remote-code-execution.     I have reported it to the author of libbpg, but no responding, so I report it to you.     The PoC file is the attachment.          Run the command ./bpgdec PoC.bpg, we wil get the crash log as follows.          Crash Logďź Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault. in av_buffer_unref at     b = (*buf)->buffer; (gdb) bt #0  in av_buffer_unref at #1  in av_frame_unref at #2  in av_frame_free at libavutil/frame.c:92 #3  in bpg_decoder_decode at       After reading the libbpg source code, I think it's a double-free issue.     Double Free: int bpg_decoder_decode(BPGDecoderContext *img, const uint8_t *buf, int buf_len) //... ret = hevc_decode_start(img, buf + idx, buf_len - idx, width, height, img->format, bit_depth, has_alpha);  | |->ret = hevc_decode_frame_internal(s, abuf, cbuf, buf, buf_len, 1); | |->ret = hevc_write_frame(s->dec_ctx, s->frame, cbuf->buf, cbuf->len); | |->len = avcodec_decode_video2(avctx, frame, &got_frame, &avpkt); | |->av_frame_unref(picture); //the first free  av_frame_free(&img->frame); //the second free in int bpg_decoder_decode(BPGDecoderContext *img, const uint8_t *buf, int buf_len)      Fix: Avoid double free, choose one of the first and second free. Maybe remove the second one.     wykcomputer@...il.com  Content of type "text/html" skipped  Download attachment "PoC.bpg" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
