The vulnerability can allow a local system user with access to the affected database in the context of a low-privileged account (CREATE/INSERT/SELECT grants) to escalate their privileges and execute arbitrary code as the database system user (typically 'mysql'). Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to gain full read/write access to all of the files (including configuration files) and databases belonging to the affected database server. The obtained level of access upon the exploitation, could be chained with the other privilege escalation vulnerabilities discovered by the author of this advisory and to further escalate privileges from mysql user to root user and thus allow attackers to fully compromise the target server.  For the latest / up-to-date advisory visit:   A copy of the full advisory is also attached to this message as per the oss-sec guidelines (for those who still use dial-up I guess... :)  PoC Video showing the exploitation of the race in a matter of seconds to get mysql shell and gaining a rootshell from there:  More updates on the feed: https://twitter.com/dawid_golunski   --  Regards, Dawid Golunski https://legalhackers.com t: @dawid_golunski  View attachment of type "text/plain" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
