This vulnerability allows to obtain a root initramfs shell on affected systems. The vulnerability is very reliable because it doesn't depend on specific systems or configurations. Attackers can copy, modify or destroy the hard disc as well as set up the network to exflitrate data.  In cloud environments it is also possible to remotely exploit this vulnerability without having "physical access."   Full description: -----------------   Regards, Hector Marco & Ismael Ripoll.
