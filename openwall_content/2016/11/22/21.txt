A fuzzing on metapixel-imagesize revealed an overflow. The latest upstream  release was about ten years ago, so I didn’t made any report. The bug does not  resides in any shared object which aren’t provided by the package. If you have  a web application which relies on the metapixel-imagesize binary, then you are  affected. Since the “READ of size 1” it may don’t warrant a CVE at all, but  some distros and packagers would have the bug fixed in their repository, so  I’m sharing it.
