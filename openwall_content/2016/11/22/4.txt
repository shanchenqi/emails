Yeah, just like the update servers from Microsoft (which are definitely a bigger POF). Or Apple. Or Google. Or Samsung. Or Mozilla.  Granted, having signatures as an additional protection on top of TLS improves security, but it's an unfortunate fact that update infrastructure is a big attack surface and a complicated problem. Signatures can only change a single point of failure to two points of failure. The solution is probably something along the lines of transparency logs and for binary software reproducible builds, but nobody has anything in that space that works today.  Wordpress could do better in terms of security with some issues, e.g. I find it disappointing that they don't seem to show any interest in deploying CSP. But the fact that Wordpress has auto updates at all imho puts it in front of every other CMS out there in terms of security. For all the others they basically expect their users to manually install updates, sometimes within hours as could've been seen with every RCE in joomla or drupal that was discovered in the past. Wordpress having an auto update has probably protected millions of webpages from being compromised.    --  Hanno Bรถck https://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
