A fuzzing on metapixel-imagesize revealed multiple assertion failures. The  latest upstream release was about ten years ago, so I didn’t made any report.  The bugs do not reside in any shared object which aren’t provided by the  package. If you have a web application which relies on the metapixel-imagesize  binary, then you are affected. Since the crashes reside in the command line  tool, they may don’t warrant a CVE at all, but some distros and packagers  would have the bugs fixed in their repository, so I’m sharing them.
