This is due to lack of validation of values for a few options.  Those options' values are then used in Vim's scripts to build a command string that's evaluated by :execute, which is what allows the shell commands to be run.  This has been fixed in Vim by patch and new Windows builds of Vim have been published with the fix, however the implications have not yet been disclosed.  Since Neovim shares this code, it is also vulnerable.  It is fixed by commit but has not yet had a release.  This affects Vim at least as far back as 7.0.  I didn't check any older versions.  This affects all released versions of Neovim.  Thanks to Florian Larysch for discovering this issue.
