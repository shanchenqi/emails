The release notes may be read at   The release notes are based on information which was available when  the bug was reported or the commit made.  If there was a CVE number,  it was made note of.  If there was a vendor issue number, that was  made note of.  Many issues may have had CVEs assigned later and (due  to lack of resources and incomplete information) we did not attempt to  investigate and back-annotate the change logs with CVE numbers.
