Description The code that parsed the HTTP request line permitted invalid characters. This could be exploited, in conjunction with a proxy that also permitted the invalid characters but with a different interpretation, to inject data into the HTTP response. By manipulating the HTTP response the attacker could poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack and/or obtain sensitive information from requests other then their own.  Mitigation Users of affected versions should apply one of the following mitigations - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat or later   (Apache Tomcat has the fix but was not released) - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat or later   (Apache Tomcat has the fix but was not released) - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat or later - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat or later - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat or later  Credit: This issue was discovered by Regis Leroy from Makina Corpus.
