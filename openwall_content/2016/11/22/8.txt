ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  LDTR, just like TR, is purely a protected mode facility.  Hence even when switching to a VM86 mode task, LDTR loading needs to follow protected mode semantics.  This was violated by the code.  IMPACT ======  On SVM (AMD hardware): a malicious unprivileged guest process can escalate its privilege to that of the guest operating system.  On both SVM and VMX (Intel hardware): a malicious unprivileged guest process can crash the guest.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Only 32-bit x86 HVM guests are vulnerable.  Furthermore, only guest operating systems which actually make use of hardware task switching, and allow a new task to start in VM86 mode, are vulnerable.  We are not aware of any such operating systems.  The vulnerability is NOT exposed on any PV guests. The vulnerability is NOT exposed on any 64-bit guests,  ARM systems are NOT vulnerable.  Xen versions from 4.0 onwards are affected.  Xen versions 3.4 and earlier are not affected.  MITIGATION ==========  For guests which are affected, the vulnerability could possibly be mitigated by disabling access to VM86 mode by unprivileged guest programs.  Details would depend on the (so far hypothetical) vulnerable guest kernel.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            xen-unstable, Xen 4.7.x, Xen 4.6.x       Xen 4.5.x, Xen 4.4.x  $   $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
