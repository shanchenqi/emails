ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Along with their main kernel binary, unprivileged guests may arrange to have their Xen environment load (kernel) symbol tables for their use.  The ELF image metadata created for this purpose has a few unused bytes when the symbol table binary is in 32-bit ELF format.  These unused bytes were not properly cleared during symbol table loading.  IMPACT ======  A malicious unprivileged guest may be able to obtain sensitive information from the host.  The information leak is small and not under the control of the guest, so effectively exploiting this vulnerability is probably difficult.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Only Xen version 4.7 is affected.  Xen versions 4.6 and earlier are not affected.  The vulnerability is not exposed to x86 HVM guests, unless the host toolstack has configured to load the guest with a non-default loader, rather than hvmloader.  MITIGATION ==========  There is no known mitigation.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Roger Pau MonnĂŠ of Citrix.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.            xen-unstable, Xen 4.7.x  $  $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)  For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information, consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:   http://www.xenproject.org/security-policy.html -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =Gc8O -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
