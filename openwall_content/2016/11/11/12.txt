On PostgreSQL (at least) it is  possible to perform updates/inserts/deletes, and database modifications  to any table the database user has access to.  The vulnerability affects all previously released pycsw versions except  and (those have been released after fixing this  security issue).  The security patch can be seen in this git commit:  The CVE ID assigned is Many thanks to the Koordinates  team for picking this issue up and to RedHat security team for their  help with the CVE.
