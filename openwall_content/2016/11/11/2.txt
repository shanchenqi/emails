Perhaps you are testing WebKit code that is too new to affect Chrome. Possibly applicable references are:      https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/third_party/WebKit/Source/wtf/   https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/chrome-rewards/  If you can confirm that Chrome is unaffected or that your report wasn't accepted at https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry?template=Security%20Bug then we can send a CVE ID here.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  aqWJRCKdup0fmNUs/xSW =2oQn -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
