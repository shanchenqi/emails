First, I'll clarify that I agree there is a bug in the initrd scripts for decrypting a system volume.  Anything that doesn't fail in a deterministic fashion is asking for trouble.  As for your scenario, as usual, it comes down to threat models.  If you don't want fellow students getting in to your laptop while you're gone for the weekend, the above is fine.  If you're a journalist in a foreign country who needs to leave her laptop in her hotel room while meeting a source, that's not sufficient. My recommendation from my original reply would be more fitting.  It should work with Secure Boot as well.  However, the golden rule still applies.  Physical access trumps all defensive measures.  The absolute best you can do is detect that physical access occurred.  From there, you're hoping there are no hardware implants or other devices outside the scope of software security.  thx,  Jason.
