Upstream bug:   Patch:   The bug was originally discovered in PHP and a workaround applied there:   Note that the PHP bug is exactly the same flaw, but they worked around it by limiting the length of strings passed to icu.  I don't believe this needs a separate CVE even though it was "fixed" independently.  While code execution is theoretically possible, bypassing the stack canary looks extremely difficult.  Most likely impact on platforms building with SSP is only a crash.   --  Doran Moppert Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
