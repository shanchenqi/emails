The installer defect  is known as an "unquoted Windows search path vulnerability."  In the case of Apache OpenOffice installers for Windows, the PC must have previously been infected by a Trojan Horse application (or user)  running with administrator privilege.  Any installer with the unquoted  search path vulnerability becomes a delayed trigger for the exploit.   The exploit may already have operated on the user's PC.  Severity: Medium      There are no known exploits of this vulnerability.     A proof-of-concept demonstration exists.  Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation  Versions Affected:      All Apache OpenOffice versions and older      are affected.  Old OpenOffice.org versions are also     affected.       Mitigation:  Install Apache OpenOffice for the latest maintenance and  cumulative security fixes.  Use <https://www.openoffice.org/download/>.  If instead of a typical installation you use a custom-installation option to change the location where Apache OpenOffice is installed, use a location that has no spaces in its full-path name.   Defenses and Work-Arounds:  If you are unable to update to there are other  precautions that can be taken.  These precautions are also  recommended as protection against other software that may  have the unquoted search path vulnerability.  Ensure that there are no programs installed at the top-level folder (usually C:\) where Windows is installed.   All are dangerous, especially ones named "Program", whether "Program.exe" or some other variation.      If such programs are found, install or update to current  anti-virus/-malware software.  Perform a complete system scan.   The scan may provide for removal of programs where there should  not be any.  If that does not happen, it is necessary to remove any Program.exe and others manually using administrator privilege.
