The location in which the installer is run may have been previously poisoned by a file that impersonates a dynamic-link library that  the installer depends upon.  The counterfeit is operated instead  because of a search-path defect in the installer.  The counterfeit  will be operated under the administrative privileges of the OpenOffice installer, compromising the user's PC.  Severity: Medium      There are no known exploits of this vulnerability.     Proof-of-concept demonstrations exist.  Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation  Versions Affected:      All Apache OpenOffice versions and older      are affected.  OpenOffice.org versions are also     affected.       Mitigation:  Install Apache OpenOffice for the latest maintenance and  cumulative security fixes.  Use <https://www.openoffice.org/download/>.   Defenses and Work-Arounds:  If you are unable to update to there are other  precautions that can be taken.  These precautions are also  recommended as protection against other software that may  have the vulnerability.  When executing .exe installers, ensure that the installer is in a file folder that has no files but the installer  .exe file.  If an installer proposes a folder to extract the setup files into before the actual install, choose the name of  a folder that is not in use.  Delete such a folder of setup  files after the installation completes successfully.  To  reinstall without downloading again, preserve the installer  .exe on private removable storage.
