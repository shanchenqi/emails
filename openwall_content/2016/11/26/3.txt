At present, it is not. The MITRE CVE team relies on Mozilla to assign CVE IDs for Firefox, on the basis of Mozilla's knowledge about their customers' needs for tracking bugs. This does not mean that Mozilla can have any arbitrary policy about what bugs are suitable for CVEs; however, we want to defer to them to the greatest reasonable extent. For example, there is a vast amount of public information about parts of the Firefox code that are associated with crashes, e.g., see     where someone could conceivably request thousands of CVE IDs.  In this specific xlink:href situation, apparently it is known that the process termination is solely the result of excessive memory consumption. From Mozilla's perspective, visiting any untrusted URL (such as a URL with an SVG document) has an expected outcome (or "impact") that Firefox MIGHT attempt to use an extremely large amount of memory. They are not tracking these cases with CVE IDs, and it seems reasonable that they would not want to. For Firefox, their customers expect to have CVE IDs that correspond to Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory documents. A general-purpose web browser has a huge attack surface, and (compared to other products) may have a different decision point about what behavior is within the range of expected impacts, versus what behavior is a vulnerability.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  VLnRzNDzJWpCh4aX0NU= =IKs3 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
