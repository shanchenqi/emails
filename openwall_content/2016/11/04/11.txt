Thanks.  Description: jasper is an open-source initiative to provide a free software-based reference  implementation of the codec specified in the Part-1 standard.  I decided to try another round of fuzzing with the Memory Sanitizer enabled,  and I discovered that there is an use-of-uninitialized-value in  jpc_pi_nextcprl  The complete MSan output:  # imginfo -f
