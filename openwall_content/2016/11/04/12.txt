A concrete attack scenario can work as follows: the attacker gets a string triggering the vulnerability into a log file (or any other thing that eventually gets displayed to the user).  When it is, at some later point, displayed to the user, "echo 'evil'\n" gets written to the user's terminal's input buffer, resulting in that command being executed by the user's shell.  For example:  > printf "\e]2;echo 'evil'\n\a\e]2;?\a"   The issue was fixed in Terminology by commit :     I would like to apply for a CVE number for this issue, on behalf of the Debian security team.
