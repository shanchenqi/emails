Gday,  I'd like to request a CVE for the following flaw found in the XFS attribute management code where over-eager error handling could create a memory leak (not in information leak) and perhaps with enough dedication and patience a local attacker could eventually leak available system memory, creating a DOS attack.  As this same flaw style appears in two functions, this could have one or two CVE's, I'll leave it up to the fine assigners at mitre to decide that.
