It appeared that previous Linux kernel versions are vulnerable, down to This fact was hidden by 'net.ipv4.tcp_fastopen' set to 0 by default, and now it is easier to notice since kernel due to commit where the default was changed to 1. With 'net.ipv4.tcp_fastopen' set to 1, previous Linux kernels including RHEL-7 ones are also vulnerable (see [0] below).  The bug is here since tcp-fastopen feature was introduced in kernel the first commit when the reproducer starts to panic the kernel with net.ipv4.tcp_fastopen=1 is which is a part of commit serie introducing net-tcp-fastopen feature:  $ git bisect bad is the first bad commit commit Author: Yuchung Cheng <ycheng@...gle.com> Date:   Thu Jul 19  So, formally, the Linux kernel upstream commit fixing the bug should have "Fixes: statement, unfortunately, this investigation was not completed at the time the patch was accepted upstream.
