The patch in is this, content from s goes into mvstr later:   # diff -u4 ---        +++        @@ @@     char mvstr[MAXSTR], *p;     BitBoard b, b2;     leaf *n1, *n2;  +   /* User input could be longer than MAXSTR */ +   if ( strlen(s) >= MAXSTR ) { +      s[MAXSTR-1] = '\0'; +   } +     TreePtr[2] = TreePtr[1];     GenMoves (1);     FilterIllegalMoves (1);     side = board.side;   Thanks and best    Sebastian  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
