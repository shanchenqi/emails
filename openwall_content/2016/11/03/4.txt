I can't find any bugtracker in lynx ,so i will disclose by this mail and sent to the author dickey@...isible-island.net.  redrain (rootredrain@...il.com) Version: and earlier Platform: Linux and Windows Vendor: http://lynx.browser.org/ Vendor Notified:   VULNERABILITY -------------------------  Lynx doesn't parse the authority component of the URL correctly when the host name part ends with '?', and could instead be tricked into connecting to a different host.  Passing in `*http://google.com?@...kdog.me/ <http://google.com?@...kdog.me/>*` <http://example.com/#@evil.com/x.txt> would wrongly make lynx send a request to hackdog.me while your browser would connect to google.com given the same URL.  PoC ------------------------ lynx  "http://google.com?@...kdog.me/"   SOLUTION ------------------------- follow the RFC and check for domains before send request.
