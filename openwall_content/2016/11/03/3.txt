Debian's w3m is the only fork still  maintained)  These issues are all fixed in released at Oct 15,  Please assign CVEs if you think they are suitable for identifiers.  Serious issues - https://github.com/tats/w3m/issues/8 stack smashed   see analysis in - https://github.com/tats/w3m/issues/9 some buffer overflow - heap write - heap write - heap corruption   itself should be only OOM. But it was affected by       which become heap corruption - heap write - global-buffer-overflow write     Moderate issues (the crash point looks not-explitable but I am not sure whether   they could be reused as exploit gadget) - https://github.com/tats/w3m/issues/7 null deref - stack overflow - bcopy negative size - array index out of bound read - null deref - use uninit value - write to rodata - null deref - stack overflow - near-null deref - near-null deref - potential heap buffer corruption   I classify this as "moderate" because the allocator do preserve more space   than required size due to bucketing. And w3m's allocator is boehmgc, it   seems not easy replacible. So the heap won't be corrupted in practice. - null deref   Not security issue, just DoS - OOM   Regards, kcwu  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
