I think everyone in the software space assumes that all DNS registries block registrations which would allocate names colliding under the IDNA and standards to different owners.  There were even attempts at the registry level to automatically alias different encodings (something which is difficult because it interferes with the goal to make the whole thing application-centric).  > For example, `straĂe.de` is translated into `strasse.de` using IDNA > but is translated into `xn--strae-oqa.de` using IDNA > Needless to say, those host names could very well resolve to > different addresses and be two completely independent servers. IDNA > is mandatory for .de domains.  What does DENIC say about this matter?  It looks like their implementation of IDNA is just very broken.
