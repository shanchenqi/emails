This number refers to the Debian package. It seems that Debian is using different version numbers for the "cryptsetup" package:   We are not sure whether the last part of the version number of the Debian package is used to match with the cryptsetup version.  Just to avoid confusion, the bug is on the scripts (initramfs) and not in the cryptsetup encryption/decryption algorithms.
