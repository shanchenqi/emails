[...]  The "2:" prefix is called an "epoch" and was introduced around the time the package was renamed from "cryptsetup-luks" to "cryptsetup" (for reasons not entirely clear to me from reading the package changelog, but is usually employed to work around version numbers going in reverse or mistakes in version numbers for a package). The -2 suffix is a package revision, which makes updated packages containing non-updated upstream releases possible (necessary to, for example, be able to fix bugs in the packaging itself). So in the case of a package version, is the corresponding upstream source version number. --  Jeremy Stanley  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
