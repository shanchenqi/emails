As per Talos page, there seems to be three issues.  - Memcached server append/prepend remote code execution vulnerability  An integer overflow in the process_bin_append_prepend function which is responsible for processing multiple commands of Memcached binary protocol can be abused to cause heap overflow and lead to remote code execution.   - Memcached server update remote code execution vulnerability  Multiple integer overflows in process_bin_update function which is responsible for processing multiple commands of Memcached binary protocol can be abused to cause heap overflow and lead to remote code execution.   - Memcached server SASL authentication remote code execution vulnerability  An integer overflow in process_bin_sasl_auth function which is responsible for authentication commands of Memcached binary protocol can be abused to cause heap overflow and lead to remote code execution.   There is also a talos blog post about these issues:   Thanks for sharing!  --  Andrej Nemec, Red Hat Product Security A9C3 EFBE D57B 6DDA  On PM, dormando wrote: > Release notes with tarball here: > > > Copy/paste from the relase notes: > Serious remote code execution bugs are fixed in this release. > > The bugs are related to the binary protocol as well as SASL authentication > of the binary protocol. > > If you do not use the binary protocol at all, a workaround is to start > memcached with -B ascii - otherwise you will need the patch in this > release. > > The diff may apply cleanly to older versions as the affected code has not > changed in a long time. > > Full details of the issues may be found here: > > > In summary: two binary protocol parsing errors, and a SASL authentication > parsing error allows buffer overflows of keys into arbitrary memory > space.
