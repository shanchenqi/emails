The MITRE CVE team has no current plans to reject this CVE. Someone may want to use the CVE ID to track something. For example, there may be people who need to track that libass is not suitable for their own use case because they require exactly the "the best you can do is to make sure [rendering] gracefully fails with an appropriate error report (error code or exception or whatever you use) if memory can't be allocated or if a library-user-specified limit is exceeded - then the library user can handle that however they want to, for example by exiting (appropriate for a command-line tool) or by reporting an error but continuing to accept new requests (appropriate for a daemon)." behavior suggested in the post.  Even if neither the upstream vendor nor any Linux distribution will ever make any code change for discussion of the issue can help with understanding the product's behavior. For example, also has a vendor comment of "Normally we should handle memory allocation failures gracefully, but there's probably still a lot of code which just crashes" that may be very relevant to planning other research.  The MITRE CVE team is willing to mark a CVE with "DISPUTED" if someone believes that it's based solely on an "AddressSanitizer failed to allocate ... bytes of LargeMmapAllocator" misinterpretation, and believes that it cannot have any relevance to risk management.  Also, of course, if a finding (such as "AddressSanitizer failed to allocate ... bytes of LargeMmapAllocator" without follow-on research) has no known audience, then sending a CVE ID request may not be the best approach.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  sRvikrhVVxQ+YrFPTT+c =aMyc -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
