It can be also reproduced using https://github.com/samboy/MaraDNS/ master branch.  Attached is patch to allow the fuzzing (it overrides getudp() with read(0, ..)), the input data that crashes MaraDNS, and the bt full output.  Please assign CVE, I would provide a patch, but MaraDNS code is extremely hard to navigate for me, so I'll leave the fix for the code author.  AFL has finished only 1 cycle (and found the 1 unique crash), so I'll keep it running for a while.
