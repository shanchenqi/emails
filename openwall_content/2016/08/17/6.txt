Vulnerable binaries compiled against such targets do not benefit of such protection, increasing the chances of success of a buffer overflow attack.  There is currently no upstream patch. Discussions on the subject & patch proposal can be found in the Red Hat corresponding bugzilla :  Impact: Low  CVSSv3 scoring : 3.6 CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N  Note regarding the scoring : only the GCC flaw was taken into account, not its potential combination with a flaw in an affected binary.  The flaw was reported by Yaakov Selkowitz (Red Hat)  Best regards,  Cedric  --  Cedric Buissart, Product Security   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
