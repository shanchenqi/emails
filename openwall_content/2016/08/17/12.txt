Description ----------- An XSS vulnerability was discovered in MantisBT's Filter API, affecting  the View Issues page. It is caused by unescaped output of the  'view_type' GPC parameter, and can be exploited as follows:  http://example.com/mantis/view_all_bug_page.php?view_type="><script>alert('XSS');</script>  To resolve the issue, the parameter's value is sanitized prior to being  stored in the filter, ensuring only authorized values 'simple' and  'advanced' are saved, and subsequently printed on the hidden form field.  Affected versions ----------------- - >= (possibly older releases as well - not tested) - >= - >=  Fixed in versions: ------------------ - -  As of this writing, these have not been released yet, but both should be  available in the coming days. Until then, installations should be  patched manually.  Please note that MantisBT was the last release in the legacy  1.2.x series, which is no longer supported; this vulnerability will  therefore NOT be patched in 1.2. All installations are strongly advised  to upgrade to MantisBT 1.3.  Patch ----- See Github [1]  Credits ------- The issue was discovered by Will Dollman of Netcraft Ltd, and fixed by  Damien Regad (MantisBT Developer).
