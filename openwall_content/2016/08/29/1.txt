The patch touches the code of underlying filesystems. So, most probably, upperdir ACL issue is not fixed by this suggested patch.

Does this also fix the upperdir ACL access gain from ?  The overlayfs upperdir part is already fixed, so the one would have to execute replacement commands for the steps already prohibited by the userns/overlayfs fixes.  hd  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
