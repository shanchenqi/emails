In Werner's messages, the MIME section has only the Content-Transfer-Encoding header, but not a Content-Type header.  Also, Werner's latest message appears to have an invalid boundary string.  (The previous message for which corruption occurred had a valid boundary string, even if unusual.  These unusual boundary strings might or might not be relevant to the problem.)  Specifically:  --=SRI-target-ANDVT-Freeh-anthrax-[Hello-to-all-my-friends-and-fans-in=  The "[" character isn't in the allowed set per RFC       boundary := bcharsnospace       bchars := bcharsnospace / " "       bcharsnospace := DIGIT / ALPHA / "'" / "(" / ")" /                       "+" / "_" / "," / "-" / "." /                       "/" / ":" / "=" / "?"  Unfortunately, the message corruption occurs post moderator approval, so I couldn't easily see whether it occurred this time or not without approving the message first.  I guess I'd need to debug it on a test list, re-injecting Werner's message on my own, but I don't currently have time for that.  I'll include Werner's original message below.  Werner, maybe you could try this old workaround for next time you post? -    (setq mml-insert-mime-headers-always t)  Thanks, and sorry, and yes this is pretty ridiculous.
