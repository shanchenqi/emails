Perhaps we need to add more criteria to select CVE assignment.  - simple DOS (e.g. NULL ptr dereference) when plugging in: No CVE - code execution (use after free, write overflows) when plugging in: Assign CVE   That said, this leaves malicious USB devices posing as regular keyboards  for text injection unclassified ...
