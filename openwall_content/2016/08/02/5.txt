It was  introduced in glibc with commit  (which also caused other  regressions, which is why we backed it out in Fedora).  The leak is triggered if name resolution functions are called in such a  way that internal resolver data structures are only initialized  partially.  The memory leak was independently reported as occurring  during Apache httpd testing, so we found it prudent to treat it as a  very minor security vulnerability.
