It is possible that a behavior like this could have its own CVE ID if it is undocumented or interacts incorrectly with run-app. For example, says "the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT or DELETE)." Do you mean, for example, that the OPTIONS or TRACE method can allow access, but the documentation suggests that only GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE need to be anticipated?  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  iQIcBAEBCAAGBQJXoSGRAAoJEHb/MwWLVhi2gEIP/iwnGiItegQOEYvx1qpyJvGP =yHDR -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
