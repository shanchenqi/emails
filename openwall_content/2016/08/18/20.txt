I investigated this yesterday, and it appears to be a long-standing bug in ezmlm-idx (hopefully already patched in newer versions, but I didn't check), which is triggered by Gnus, depending on a combination of settings on both sides - specifically, when a MIME section does not include a Content-Type header, yet the list is configured to remove sections with some MIME types.  The MIME type should then default to text/plain, and the section preserved, but ezmlm-idx would forget to set a flag indicating that such section is OK to keep.  I think I've patched this on the server now, but I didn't test.
