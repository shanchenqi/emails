That is unacceptable since a server by specification is allowed to skip the client certificate check on resume, and may instead use the old identity which was established by the previous certificate (or no certificate).  libcurl supports by default the use of TLS session id/ticket to resume previous TLS sessions to speed up subsequent TLS handshakes. They are used when for any reason an existing TLS connection couldn't be kept alive to make the next handshake faster.  We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.  INFO ----  This flaw also affects the curl command line tool.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name to this issue.  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  This flaw is relevant for all versions of curl and libcurl that support TLS and client certificates.  - Affected versions: libcurl 7.1 to and including - Not affected versions: libcurl >=  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!  THE SOLUTION ------------  In version TLS session resumption is disabled when a client certificate is used so that a subsequent connection attempt to the same server cannot risk getting a previously authenticated session resumed.  A [patch for is available.  RECOMMENDATIONS ---------------  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:    A - Upgrade curl and libcurl to version    B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild    C - Set `CURLOPT_SSL_SESSIONID_CACHE` to 0L when using client certificates  TIME LINE ---------  It was first reported to the curl project in April by Bru Rom. We contacted distros@...nwall on July 31.  libcurl was released on August 3 coordinated with the publication of this advisory.  CREDITS -------  Contributions by Eric Rescorla and Ray Satiro.
