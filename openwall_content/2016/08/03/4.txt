It does this by keeping a few previous connections "alive" in a connection pool so that a subsequent request that can use one of them instead of creating a new connection will do so.  When using a client certificate for a connection that was then put into the connection pool, that connection could then wrongly get reused in a subsequent request to that same server that either didn't use a client certificate at all or that asked to use a different client certificate thus trying to tell the user that it is a different entity.  This mistakenly using the wrong connection could of course lead to applications sending requests to the wrong realms of the server using authentication that it wasn't supposed to have for those operations.  We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.  INFO ----  This flaw also affects the curl command line tool.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name to this issue.  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  This flaw is relevant for all versions of curl and libcurl that support SSL/TLS and client certificates.  - Affected versions: libcurl 7.1 to and including - Not affected versions: libcurl >=  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!  THE SOLUTION ------------  In version curl will check that re-used connections have the correct client certificate (file name) before used.  A [patch for is available. This patch relies on the patch already having been applied.  RECOMMENDATIONS ---------------  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:    A - Upgrade curl and libcurl to version    B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild    C - Do not use client certificates  TIME LINE ---------  This was figured out by curl security team members during our work with the flaw during June We contacted distros@...nwall on July 31.  libcurl was released on August 3 coordinated with the publication of this advisory.  CREDITS -------  Found by the curl security team. Patch by Daniel Stenberg.
