When an application compiled against the cracklib libary, such as "passwd" is used to parse the GECOS field, it could cause the application to crash or execute arbitary code with the permissions of the user running such an application.  To trigger the flaw, you need a specially-crafted "long" GECOS field, which can be done by a local user on the system. The attacker then needs to run some utility which uses cracklib to process this long GECOS field on the system. (such as "passwd" application which runs suid root)  All versions of the cracklib library shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux are compiled with FORTIFY_SOURCE, which detects the buffer-overflow and aborts the application safely.  Therefore the maximum impact of this flaw is application crash.  However, there may be other applications, distributions which dont compile cracklib with FORTIFY_SOURCE, and this can lead to easy code exec or even privsec.  A proposed patch is available at:  This flaw was assigned and it was previously disclosed via linux-distros mailing list.   --  Huzaifa Sidhpurwala / Red Hat Product Security Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
