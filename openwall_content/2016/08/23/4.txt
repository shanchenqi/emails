TBH I'm not sure what the difference is between say the above USB killer and a small taser or a small squirt bottle of saline solution.  In general I should be able to plug USB devices into a computer without the computer succumbing to software based attacks (stuxnet anyone?).  -- Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
