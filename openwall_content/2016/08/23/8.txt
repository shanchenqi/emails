In the SuSE Bugzilla, it was noted that there is still another buffer overflow present, cf.    and the patch   > - Add patch >  to fix a new buffer overflow identified together with [...] > The input word is guaranteed to be at most STRINGSIZE-1 in length. > One of the mangle operations involves duplicating the input word, > resulting in a string twice the length to be accommodated by both > area variables.   was applied.  Should that possibly get a further CVE id for reference?
