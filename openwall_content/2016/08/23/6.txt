Based on what I said, I don't know if any of the following crashes have been  reported in the past.  I know that Jasper clearly state about its capability on the BMP format, so if  you think that something is suitable for an identifier, please assign one. Thanks.  NOTE: The command used in all cases was: imginfo $CRAFTED_IMAGE   1) THE BMP FORMAT IS NOT FULLY SUPPORTED! THAT IS, THE JASPER SOFTWARE CANNOT DECODE ALL TYPES OF BMP DATA. IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS, PLEASE TRY CONVERTING YOUR IMAGE DATA TO THE PNM FORMAT, AND USING THIS FORMAT INSTEAD. skipping unknown data in BMP file ASAN:DEADLYSIGNAL ================================================================= AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address (pc  bp sp T0)     #0 in bmp_getdata     #1 in bmp_decode     #2 in jas_image_decode     #3 in main     #4 in __libc_start_main /var/tmp/portage/sys-     #5 in _init  AddressSanitizer can not provide additional info.
