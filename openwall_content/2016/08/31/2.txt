I did not author this code, which has been like this since before I even joined the project [1]. The implementation of Gravatar as a plugin just recycled the existing code.  IMO your suggestion to always use https makes sense, I'm cc'ing the MantisBT dev list as this is probably better discussed there. You're also welcome to open an issue in our tracker if you want.
