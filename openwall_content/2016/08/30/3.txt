We feel that it is possible that there are related issues that are also vulnerabilities.  mentions "Empty path components don't make sense for most commands and may cause undefined behavior, depending on the backend." The patch blocks these empty strings. Would it be best to consider this a vulnerability fix (i.e., because the undefined behavior might be security-relevant)?  also makes a change to forbid '/' characters, with the rationale that the specification requires clients to send individual path components, not full path strings or substrings containing a '/' character. Does this also fix a vulnerability?  prevents creating files named "." and ".." (just those two specific filenames, not all pathnames containing those characters). Does this also fix a vulnerability?  It is possible that up to three additional CVE IDs are needed.  Finally, if fixing the directory traversal itself requires both and (for '/' characters), please let us know.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  ARsgi+SnlhEpKAfzmkeJ =KDIm -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
