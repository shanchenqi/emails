When file permissions are modified via chmod(2) and the user is not in the owning group or capable of CAP_FSETID, the setgid bit is cleared in inode_change_ok().  Setting a POSIX ACL via setxattr(2) sets the file permissions as well as the new ACL, but doesn't clear the setgid bit in a similar way; this allows to bypass the check in chmod(2).  A proposed fix:  Initial discussion:  Red Hat security Bugzilla:  The fix is not yet accepted to the Linux kernel upstream.
