Use The scope of this CVE is the entire 'INPUTRC should not be included in "env_keep" at all, or else somehow restricted' problem, which has both the information disclosure and segmentation fault outcomes.   >>>>  >>>> Since there is already current_readline_init_include_level, maybe >>>> implementing a max level for $include's would be worthwhile.  >>> I'll consider it for the next version.  If there is a reason that this must also be considered a vulnerability in readline, please let us know. For example, maybe there are other common programs that accept an INPUTRC environment variable over the network during a login session for an authenticated attacker who is only supposed to be able to execute a single command. Suppose that this attacker can also create files beginning with $include (e.g., by writing to a shared filesystem or using FTP upload). The unlimited include level might allow much more resource consumption than intended. Another possibility is that the INPUTRC environment variable could specify a file that should not be read by this type of restricted account, e.g., the /dev/zero file. However, we do not know of a realistic attack scenario in which readline would be considered the vulnerable software. There are no other CVE IDs -- either for readline or for any other software -- at this time.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  GulJIV7CVPniP8lUCUhY =B2yA -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
