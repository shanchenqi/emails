It will be available from the mirrors listed at http://www.openssh.com/ shortly.  OpenSSH is a complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and includes sftp client and server support. OpenSSH also includes transitional support for the legacy SSH 1.3 and 1.5 protocols that may be enabled at compile-time.  Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their continued support of the project, especially those who contributed code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the project. More information on donations may be found at: http://www.openssh.com/donations.html  Future deprecation notice =========================  We plan on retiring more legacy cryptography in a near-future release, specifically:   * Refusing all RSA keys smaller than bits (the current minimum    is bits)  * Removing server-side support for the SSH v.1 protocol (currently    compile-time disabled).  * In approximately 1 year, removing all support for the SSH v.1    protocol (currently compile-time disabled).  This list reflects our current intentions, but please check the final release notes for future releases.  Changes since OpenSSH 7.2 =========================  This is primarily a bugfix release.  Security --------   * sshd(8): Mitigate a potential denial-of-service attack against    the system's crypt(3) function via sshd(8). An attacker could    send very long passwords that would cause excessive CPU use in    crypt(3). sshd(8) now refuses to accept password authentication    requests of length greater than characters. Independently    reported by Tomas Kuthan (Oracle), Andres Rojas and Javier Nieto.   * sshd(8): Mitigate timing differences in password authentication    that could be used to discern valid from invalid account names    when long passwords were sent and particular password hashing    algorithms are in use on the server. reported by    EddieEzra.Harari at verint.com   * ssh(1), sshd(8): Fix observable timing weakness in the CBC padding    oracle countermeasures. Reported by Jean Paul Degabriele, Kenny    Paterson, Torben Hansen and Martin Albrecht. Note that CBC ciphers    are disabled by default and only included for legacy compatibility.   * ssh(1), sshd(8): Improve operation ordering of MAC verification for    Encrypt-then-MAC (EtM) mode transport MAC algorithms to verify the    MAC before decrypting any ciphertext. This removes the possibility    of timing differences leaking facts about the plaintext, though no    such leakage has been observed.  Reported by Jean Paul Degabriele,    Kenny Paterson, Torben Hansen and Martin Albrecht.       * sshd(8): (portable only) Ignore PAM environment vars when    UseLogin=yes. If PAM is configured to read user-specified    environment variables and UseLogin=yes in sshd_config, then a    hostile local user may attack /bin/login via LD_PRELOAD or    similar environment variables set via PAM.    found by Shayan Sadigh.  New Features ------------   * ssh(1): Add a ProxyJump option and corresponding -J command-line    flag to allow simplified indirection through a one or more SSH    bastions or "jump hosts".   * ssh(1): Add an IdentityAgent option to allow specifying specific    agent sockets instead of accepting one from the environment.       * ssh(1): Allow ExitOnForwardFailure and ClearAllForwardings to be    optionally overridden when using ssh -W.   * ssh(1), sshd(8): Implement support for the IUTF8 terminal mode as    per       * ssh(1), sshd(8): Add support for additional fixed Diffie-Hellman    2K, 4K and 8K groups from   * ssh-keygen(1), ssh(1), sshd(8): support and RSA    signatures in certificates;       * ssh(1): Add an Include directive for ssh_config(5) files.   * ssh(1): Permit UTF-8 characters in pre-authentication banners sent    from the server.  Bugfixes --------   * ssh(1), sshd(8): Reduce the syslog level of some relatively common    protocol events from LOG_CRIT.   * sshd(8): Refuse AuthenticationMethods="" in configurations and    accept AuthenticationMethods=any for the default behaviour of not    requiring multiple authentication.   * sshd(8): Remove obsolete and misleading "POSSIBLE BREAK-IN    ATTEMPT!" message when forward and reverse DNS don't match.   * ssh(1): Close ControlPersist background process stderr except    in debug mode or when logging to syslog.   * misc: Make PROTOCOL description for direct-streamlocal@...nssh.com    channel open messages match deployed code.   * ssh(1): Deduplicate LocalForward and RemoteForward entries to fix    failures when both ExitOnForwardFailure and hostname    canonicalisation are enabled.   * sshd(8): Remove fallback from moduli to obsolete "primes" file    that was deprecated in   * sshd_config(5): Correct description of UseDNS: it affects ssh    hostname processing for authorized_keys, not known_hosts;       * ssh(1): Fix authentication using lone certificate keys in an agent    without corresponding private keys on the filesystem.   * sshd(8): Send ClientAliveInterval pings when a time-based    RekeyLimit is set; previously keepalive packets were not being    sent.      Portability -----------   * ssh(1), sshd(8): Fix compilation by automatically disabling ciphers    not supported by OpenSSL.   * misc: Fix compilation failures on some versions of AIX's compiler    related to the definition of the VA_COPY macro.   * sshd(8): Whitelist more architectures to enable the seccomp-bpf    sandbox.   * ssh-agent(1), sftp-server(8): Disable process tracing on Solaris    using setpflags(__PROC_PROTECT, ...).   * sshd(8): On Solaris, don't call Solaris setproject() with    UsePAM=yes it's PAM's responsibility.
