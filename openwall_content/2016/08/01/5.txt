However, i report the following vulnerable URL of example:   It's important to note that the url requested is built in the following  manner: - only .. "encoded characters" are permitted when you insert the  traversal request - At the end of the file is necessary insert *%00* and *.html* otherwise  the request is not accepted  So, to navigate filesystem is recommended to use Burp Suite "repeater  tab" tool.  If there are no CVE about this finding, at this pourpose i require a CVE  please.
