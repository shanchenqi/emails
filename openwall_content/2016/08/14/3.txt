CHICKEN preallocated an argument array of ARG_MAX items (or if that was undefined), and an environment array of ENV_MAX items (or if that was undefined), and did not verify that the arguments or environment lists were less than this size, resulting in a buffer overrun if these lists were longer.  The full announcement can be found here:  The bugfix also fixed a memory leak in the same piece of code, which could potentially be used to cause resource exhaustion/denial of service situation.  Does this warrant another CVE?  The bug affects all releases of CHICKEN up to and including  Cheers, Peter Bex  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
