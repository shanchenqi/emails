I tried to keep the format, in first referenging the bug in the Debian bugtracker, and then giving additional references which were provided by Bastien in the corresponding bug.  Could you assing CVEs for those item, to identify the issues across distributions as well?  off-by-one error leading to segfault: 	Debian Bug: 	Additional references: 	----------------------  out-of-bounds read in coders/psd.c: 	Debian Bug: 	Additional references: 	---------------------- 	https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/83  rle file handling for corrupted file: 	Debian Bug: 	Additional references: 	---------------------- 	https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/82  buffer overflow in sun file handling: 	Debian Bug: 	Additional references: 	----------------------  potential DOS in sun file handling due to malformed files: 	Debian Bug: 	Additional references: 	----------------------  out of bunds problem in rle, pict, viff and sun files: 	Debian Bug: 	Additional references: 	---------------------- 	https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/77 	https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/80 	https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/81 	https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/82  heap overflow in hdr file handling: 	Debian Bug: 	Additional references: 	---------------------- 	https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/90  heap buffer overflow in psd file handling: 	Debian Bug: 	Additional references: 	---------------------- 	https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/92  out of bound access for malformed psd file: 	Debian Bug: 	Additional references: 	---------------------- 	https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/93  meta file out of bound access: 	Debian Bug: 	Additional references: 	---------------------- 	https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/96  heap buffer overflow in psd file coder: 	Debian Bug: 	Additional references: 	---------------------- 	https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/98  out of bound access in wpg file coder: 	Debian Bug: 	Additional references: 	----------------------  out of bound access for viff file coder: 	Debian Bug: 	Additional references: 	---------------------- 	https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/99  out of bound access in xcf file coder: 	Debian Bug: 	Additional references: 	----------------------  out of bound in quantum handling: 	Debian Bug: 	Additional references: 	----------------------  pbd file out of bound access: 	Debian Bug: 	Additional references: 	----------------------  Fix handling of corrupted psd file: 	Debian Bug: 	Additional references: 	----------------------  wpg file out of bound for corrupted file: 	Debian Bug: 	Additional references: 	----------------------  out of bound access in generic decoder: 	Debian Bug: 	Additional references: 	----------------------  out of bound access for corrupted psd file: 	Debian Bug: 	Additional references: 	----------------------  SEGV reported in corrupted profile handling: 	Debian Bug: 	Additional references: 	----------------------  out of bound access for corrupted pdb file: 	Debian Bug: 	Additional references: 	----------------------  SIGABRT for corrupted pdb file: 	Debian Bug: 	Additional references: 	----------------------  DOS due to corrupted DDS files: 	Debian Bug: 	Additional references: 	----------------------  DOS due to corrupted DDS files: 	Debian Bug: 	Additional references: 	----------------------  potential DOS by not releasing memory: 	Debian Bug: 	Additional references: 	---------------------- 	Fixed by:  writing to rgf format aborts: 	Debian Bug: 	Additional references: 	----------------------  Regards, Salvatore  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
