System using the infiniband support module ib_srpt were vulnerable to a denial of service by system crash by a local attacker who is able to abort writes to a device using this initiator.  There were multiple areas in which aborting a scsi command are able to be handled, moving this to the correct location in the state machine ensured that this condition was never triggered through this code path.  The null pointer situation was enabled via a non attacker controlled meset() call, and this is not a use after free.  From my undestanding it is a denial of service only.
