As part of upstream (I joined the team recently) I would like to make   you aware of (at least) two security issues +/- recently discovered:  (1) Possibility of code injection when setting passwords for Samba.   Solved upstream:  (2) XSS vulnerability during session log on. Solved upstream:  Please assign individual CVE Ids for both issues, if appropriate.
