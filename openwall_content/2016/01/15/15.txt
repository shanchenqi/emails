Yes. Or preferably you could provide a custom buffer pointer for the stdio FILE to use and clear it safely yourself after calling fclose.  > What about a buffering flag (_IOSBF) that would enable "secure"  > handling of the buffer, that is, on fclose() and fflush(), write > back and cleanse buffer on output stream, cleanse buffer on input > stream ?  This sounds undesirable when there is already a portable fix (above). There are also some issues with compatibility for such a feature between versions and what symbol versioning might be needed.
