The ssh client continued by generating fake authentication cookie and allowed remote X clients to connect the local X server.  The decision if client connection was accepted was delegated to the X server which, depending on its configuration, could allow clients to open trusted X connection.  This would lead to remote X clients having more privileged access to the local X server than intended.  This problem can occur when X server does not include or enable X Security extension (for X.org X server, this extension is not compiled in by default since and when it has authentication methods besides MIT cookies enabled (e.g. localuser authentication allowing all X connections from a local user who owns the X session).  Both of these conditions are satisfied on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and current Fedora versions.  The X server does not have X Security extension compiled in and 'xhost +si:localuser:`id -un`' is run from the xinit scripts.  Therefore remote X clients are granted trusted access to the local X server when 'ssh -X' is used, as if 'ssh -Y' was actually used.  The X server on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 includes X Security extension (as of - - which was released as part of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5) and hence does not fall back to the use of fake authentication cookie.  This issue was corrected upstream in version  Upstream commit:  which needs to be applied after:  =============  We reported it upstream but we did NOT assign a CVE to this issue (I think because we're not affected it was going to be left to upstream). This issue does appear to need a CVE, however since it is public now I'll leave that up to Mitre.    > > - -- > CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority > M/S > Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA > [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] > -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- > Version: GnuPG v1 > > > > > > > > > > > > > > =x5zR > -----END PGP SIGNATURE----- >    --   -- Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
