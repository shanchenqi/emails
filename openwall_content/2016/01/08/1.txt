We realize that it might, at least, be considered a vulnerability for Debian systems because of "Tags: security" in the original report.  For example, is there a specific piece of data in the files that is always supposed to be private?  indicates that an unprivileged user can obtain information by directly opening the files, but cannot obtain this information with an "/sbin/iptables -L" command. This does not, by itself, establish that a security feature has been defeated. It is possible that it was simply inconvenient to implement the -L option in a way that provided access to unprivileged users.  What we are trying to avoid is a situation in which CVE IDs are assigned solely because a system administrator might not want files to be readable by unprivileged users. For example, maybe someone would prefer stricter /etc/hosts.allow permissions to prevent rogue local users from discovering the names of other hosts that possibly have symmetric "allow" policies.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  DWWefmwjSryUtuTL7PoGkbUvvExCHmpgzoGTcBAiRHwoA+CZDxqZi0epoODGUkTo =FspR -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
