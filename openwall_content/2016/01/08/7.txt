As mentioned on that security.html page, "These issues were found by Jouni Malinen as part of investigating - this suggested a possibility that the CVE IDs listed in would be applicable. However, FreeRADIUS apparently has an independent implementation of EAP-pwd. This led to a somewhat unusual situation in which most of the vulnerability findings were, at a high level, the same -- but resulted from a different set of mistakes within a different codebase. The applicable FreeRADIUS changes can be found in the "Commits on May 4, section of:    https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commits/v3.0.x/src/modules/rlm_eap/types/rlm_eap_pwd  and are distinct from the changes in the patches.  We are associating the three CVE IDs below with the items on the security.html list, not with the specific FreeRADIUS commits.   >> The EAP-PWD packet length is not checked before the first byte is >> dereferenced. A zero-length EAP-PWD packet will cause the module to >> dereference a NULL pointer, and will cause the server to crash.  Use   >> The commit message payload length is not validated before the packet >> is decoded. This can result in a read overflow in the server. >>  >> The confirm message payload length is not validated before the packet > is decoded. This can result in a read overflow in the server.  Use for both of these issues.   >> A strcpy() was used to pack a C string into an EAP-PWD packet. This >> would result in an over-run of the destination buffer by one byte.
