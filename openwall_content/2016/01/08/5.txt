Details below.  prosody: path traversal vulnerability in the built-in HTTP server's file-serving module -------------  Project: Prosody XMPP server URL: https://prosody.im/ Affected versions:     0.9.x (before (unreleased) Affected Prosody modules:     mod_http_files (and community modules that depend on it) Fixed versions:     nightly build trunk nightly build  Description -----------  A flaw was found in Prosody's HTTP file-serving module (mod_http_files) that allows it to serve requests outside of the configured public root directory. This could allow attackers access to private files including sensitive data.  Affected configurations -----------------------  The default configuration has mod_http_files disabled, and is not vulnerable. Additionally, configurations where mod_http_files serves files at the root URL (e.g. not /files/ prefix, using http_paths) are not vulnerable.  Temporary mitigation --------------------  Disable mod_http_files and any community modules that depend on it.  Advice ------  All users should upgrade to or check their OS distribution for security updates. Users of development branches trunk) should upgrade to the latest nightly builds.  Credits -------  The flaw was discovered by Kim Alvefur, a member of the Prosody team.  //////////////////////////  prosody: using a weak PRNG to generate the authentication secret used when verifying server-to-server connections using the dialback method. -------------  Project: Prosody XMPP server URL: https://prosody.im/ Affected versions:     All Affected Prosody modules:     mod_dialback Fixed versions:     nightly build trunk nightly build  Description -----------  It was discovered that Prosody's generation of the secret token for server-to-server dialback authentication relied upon a weak random number generator that was not cryptographically secure. This allows an attacker to guess at probable values of the secret key. A successful guess allows impersonation of the affected domain to other servers on the network.  Affected configurations -----------------------  Configurations with mod_dialback loaded (default configuration) are affected.  Servers with s2s_secure_auth = true will not be susceptible to incoming attempts to spoof other domains on the network. However if mod_dialback is loaded, a server's domain's may still be spoofed by an attacker in connections to other servers.  Not affected are configurations with a strong custom dialback_secret set (though periodically regenerating the dialback_secret is still advisable).  Temporary mitigation --------------------  Set the 'dialback_secret' option in your configuration file to a long random string.  A strong dialback_secret can be generated (for example) using the command:  head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64  Alternatively disable mod_dialback by adding it to your modules_disabled option in your configuration file. In this case communication with servers that only support dialback or have untrusted certificates will not be possible.  Advice ------  All users should upgrade to or check their OS distribution for security updates. Users of development branches trunk) should upgrade to the latest nightly builds.  Credits -------  The flaw was discovered and reported by Thijs Alkemade.
