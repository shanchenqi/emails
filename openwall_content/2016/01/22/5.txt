Yes. At one time ECC looked good because it offered comparable strength with  fewer operations so it was faster in the age of slower CPUs. Now, the threat  has changed and people are looking over the not too distant future at how best  to provide some resistance in the face of a very different landscape. Things  that are computationally expensive start looking better. The slide on page 9  kind of shows the concern. The leftover part of rectangle X not covered by  rectangle Z means spilled secrets.  To my mind, one of the things that we as an open source community need to  think hard about is how we are going to protect data in the Quantum computing  age. If many of the new QR algorithms get patented, where does that leave us?  Its kinda like ECC all over again except this time the consequences are much  more dire because there may not be any IP unencumbered algorithm to jump to. I  certainly hope that won't be the case.  -Steve   > [1] That was suggested on a couple of discussion groups as a possible > motivation for the newly rekindled RSA love. >  > [1]  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
