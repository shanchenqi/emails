For example:      https://nodejs.org/api/dgram.html#dgram_socket_send_buf_offset_length_port_address_callback  suggests that the problem is that Node.js allows people to write incorrect server-side code in which there is a call to socket.send, socket.ping, or socket.pong with a numerical argument. However, the documentation states that the argument must be a Buffer object or string. Behavior in the case of a numerical argument seems to be undefined. The change seems to be a hardening measure in which numerical arguments are automatically converted to strings, thereby making it safer to execute a specific type of incorrect code.  If incorrect server-side code actually exists in a product, then a CVE ID can be assigned.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  dBrwTilumCdT13FjYkhf =hyHR -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
