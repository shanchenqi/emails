It's also assuming no other major breakthrough happens (whether it's in maths, moore's law or anything else)...  but here we are talking about making recommendations towards replacing legacy crypto we suspect^wknow to be broken, in practice, in the real world, today.  I think that it's very important to keep the message simple: use bigger (possibly standardized) groups, of at least X bits. The BSI thinks that X should be greater than bits and so do I.
