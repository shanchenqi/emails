I think that is assuming that quantum computers are not brought to market any  time soon. Over the summer the NSA's Suite B page kind of backpeddled on the  ECC requirements and refocused on RSA. I attended a speech this fall where  NIST talked about what quantum computers will do. The presentation is here but  does not have speakers notes:   This is the notes that I took while listening to the speech:  This panelist talked about quantum crypto. The issue is that quantum computers  could use Shor's algorithm and Grover's algorithm to kill PKI. In the future  key sizes could be around a million bits. This will mean changes to network  protocols. Its estimated that a key space of N can be search in the square  root of N time. So, in current technology, if you need bits of strength,  you will need to square it to get the key size.  Hallway discussions mentioned that ECC is dead due to trust issues and fuzzy  IP issues which slowed vendor uptake. There was a mention of RSA officially  being allowed to go to 16k key sizes.  -Steve   > I haven't found anyone suggesting that bigger groups are either > necessary or worth it.
