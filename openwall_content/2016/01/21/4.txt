For details see: http://www.privoxy.org/ or http://jvauzb4sb3bwlsnc.onion/  A couple of invalid reads were fixed in Privoxy whose release is scheduled for this weekend.  Two of them are security issues (remote DoS when built with ASAN), please assign CVEs:  - Prevent invalid reads in case of corrupt chunk-encoded content.    - Remove empty Host headers in client requests.   Previously they would result in invalid reads.    The issues were found with afl-fuzz and AddressSanitizer.
