PHP is used for much, much more than building simple frontpages without a backend (where this might be a senseless complication). RSA is still the way to go about implementing accessible asymmetrical crypography...  I do agree, wholeheartedly, that building your own cryptographic primitives is just an expensive way of ultimately fooling yourself.  Just wondering...   All the best,   Bart   <rant> PS: All this bashing on PHP really tires me - it's getting old and redundant. And no - im not a PHP developer. </rant> -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (MingW32)  =o7rc -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----   This email and any attached files are confidential and intended solely for the intended recipient(s).
