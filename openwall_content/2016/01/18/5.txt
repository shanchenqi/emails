That entirely depends on how the data is read or written.  glibc will make additional copies on the heap in some cases.  In any case, this is an implementation detail.  Even if the data is gone from the process image, the kernel or its hypervisor may still keep copies, particularly if the data is (or was once) on the file system.  It is very hard to override data reliably on modern systems.
