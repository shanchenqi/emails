Description:  Until now, MantisBT sensitive config options were blacklisted to prevent  their access via SOAP API (see config_is_private() function).  When a new config is added or an existing one is renamed, the black list  must be updated accordingly. If this is not or incorrectly done, the  config becomes available via SOAP API.  This was the case with the MantisBT master cryptographic salt  (crypto_master_salt): it was incorrectly spelt.  To fix the problem as well as avoid future occurences, we are switching  to a whitelist approach, i.e. listing all configs that *can* be accessed  via SOAP.  Any MantisBT installation with SOAP API enabled should be patched, and  immediately generate a new salt.   Affected versions:  >=  Fixed in versions: (not yet released), possibly if we decide we need  another release candidate before that.  Patch: See Github [1]  Credits: The issue was discovered by Paul Richards [2] and fixed by Roland Becker (MantisBT Developer).
