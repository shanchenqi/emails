It provides routines to view and manipulate a wide range of image formats and can be accessed through many popular programming languages like Python, C#, Java and PHP.  GDCM versions and (and possibly previous versions) are prone to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability due to missing checks. The vulnerability occurs during the decoding of JPEG-LS images when the dimensions of the embedded JPEG-LS image (as specified in the JPEG headers) are smaller than the ones of the selected region (set by gdcm::ImageRegionReader::SetRegion and usually based on DICOM header values).  More information about this vulnerability can be found at  The GDCM project has released version that addresses this issue. It is advised to upgrade all GDCM installations to the latest stable release.
