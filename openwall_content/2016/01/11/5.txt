It provides routines to view and manipulate a wide range of image formats and can be accessed through many popular programming languages like Python, C#, Java and PHP.  GDCM versions and (and possibly previous versions) are prone to an integer overflow vulnerability which leads to a buffer overflow and potentially to remote code execution. The vulnerability is triggered by the exposed function gdcm::ImageRegionReader::ReadIntoBuffer, which copies DICOM image data to a buffer. ReadIntoBuffer checks whether the supplied buffer is large enough to hold the necessary data, however in this check it fails to detect the occurrence of an integer overflow, which leads to a buffer overflow later on in the code. The buffer overflow will occur regardless of the size of the buffer supplied to the ReadIntoBuffer call.  More information about this vulnerability can be found at  The GDCM project has released version that addresses this issue. It is advised to upgrade all GDCM installations to the latest stable release.
