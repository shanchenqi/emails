It could occur while processing  firmware configurations, if the current configuration entry value was set to  be invalid(FW_CFG_INVALID=0xffff).  A privileged(CAP_SYS_RAWIO) user/process inside guest could use this flaw to  crash the Qemu process instance resulting in DoS OR potentially execute  arbitrary code with privileges of the Qemu process on the host.
