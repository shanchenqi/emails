If a StorageError occurs when attempting to connect a volume using the Xen API, the connection parameters will be logged. These parameters may include credentials that are not masked. An attacker with read access to Nova logs could use these credentials with the Xen API directly. Only Nova deployments using the Xen backend are affected by this flaw.
