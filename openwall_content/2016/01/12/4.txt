Thanks.   Vtiger CRM 6.4 Authenticated Remote Code Execution  1. Summary 2. Vulnerability Details 3. References  ########## 1. Summary ##########  Vtiger CRM  <https://www.vtiger.com/open-source/> is a CRM application.  Vtiger CRM version 6.4 (“Open Source” branch; released on is vulnerable to Authenticated Remote Code Execution.  This vulnerability is different than (in fact it is a result of an insufficient fix for   ########## 2. Vulnerability Details ##########  Vtiger CRM allows for the upload of a "company logo" from within the administrative interface.  Multiple flaws in the Settings_Vtiger_CompanyDetailsSave_Action class allow attackers to upload files with (almost) arbitrary contents, including PHP code passing commands to the underlying operating system.  The previously mentioned vulnerability, was partially caused by an insufficient file type check, relying on the MIME type ("Content-Type") sent by the client.  In an attempt to mitigate the resulting security issues, the following "mime type check" was added with a Vtiger CRM 6.3 security patch (released on and Vtiger CRM 6.4 (released on  //mime type check $mimeType = mime_content_type($logoDetails['tmp_name']); $mimeTypeContents = explode('/', $mimeType); if (!$logoDetails['size'] || $mimeTypeContents[0] != 'image' || !in_array($mimeTypeContents[1], Settings_Vtiger_CompanyDetails_Model::$logoSupportedFormats)) {     $saveLogo = false; }  However, an attacker may choose to embed malicious PHP code within a valid image file, for example as EXIF data of a JPEG file. Once the server has received the attacker's JPEG file, mime_content_type() will process it, correctly consider it to be a valid image file, and return the MIME type "image/jpeg" -- which passes Vtiger's "mime type check".  Because Vtiger allows users to freely choose the name of an uploaded file, even if the file's extension does not match the previously determined MIME type, an attacker can upload the image file with a ".php" extension.  Vtiger CRM then saves the uploaded file's contents with the client-specified file name in the publicly accessible "test/logo/" directory.  The code can then be run by accessing the location of the uploaded file (“<Vtiger URL>/test/logo/<attacker-specified file name>”).   ########## 3.
