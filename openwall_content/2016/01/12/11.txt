That's right. This issue affects Qemu versions prior to 2.4. Above change  was made immediately after the release of v2.3.   ->  Thank you. -- Prasad J Pandit / Red Hat Product Security Team 47AF CE69 54AA DD13 FE5B  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
