Upstream fix:  Cyanogenmod's backport fix:  It was lacking a check for valid length of copy a buffer, which can be crafted by userspace. The application could communicate with wlan driver via ioctl() with to enter into vulnerable code path.  This issue may leads to a local DoS or privilege escalation. Some android phone/tablet are still using the vulnerable version of prima driver. We've aware of android-msm-flo-3.4-marshmallow for Nexus 7( is affected by this isuee:  https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/msm/+/android-msm-flo-3.4-marshmallow  Plz review the file:  msm-kernel/drivers/staging/prima/CORE/HDD/src/wlan_hdd_wext.c   Then we've already sent a patch to backport fix for the branch and still doesn't get any answer yet:   PoC:  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hardenedlinux/offensive_poc/master/prima_wlan_poc/wext_poc.c  Panic log: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hardenedlinux/offensive_poc/master/prima_wlan_poc/panic.log  Mitigation:  We haven't exmine if this issue can be exploited to gain the root privileges. But some fancy mitigation like PXN is not support well for android armv7. Porting PaX UDEREF is an another option.     --  GNU powered it... GPL protect it...
