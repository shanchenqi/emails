Having worked heavily with projects such as Shodan, I understand that there are two sides to the coin. However, many issues have been brought to light with such services that would otherwise not have been known to the sec community.  I'm not sure if @achillean (John Matherly) is on oss-sec, but he is always very forthcoming in dealing with these kinds of things. My suggestion would be to reach out to him and find out.  Zach W.
