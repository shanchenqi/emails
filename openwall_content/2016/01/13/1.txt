Tried it. Too much output to be of any use. With complaints like I: [group_writable] /home/dave/home/dave/.gnupg/pubring.gpg is owned   by user dave (group dave) and is group-writable (-rwxrwx---) W: [setgid] is setgid (root, nogroup):   -rwxr-sr-x W: [setuid] /usr/bin/su is setuid (root, root): -rwsr-xr-x  With lines going to stdout on my system, a quick skim of the output doesn't show anything useful. I don't see anything in the output that it's complaining about, that isn't as it should be.
