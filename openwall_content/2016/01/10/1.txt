Thanks for your reply, really appreciated that you took time to review the request.

I can follow the reasoning. I agree that it might be borderline to actually request a CVE for this issue. The situation which I had in mind is a multi-user system, where the administrator has set some iptables rules up, and the regular users of the system should not know about how they are set up. If the admin uses iptables-persistent from Debian these set rules (restored after boot) are disclosed though to the users via the files /etc/iptables/rules.{v4,v6}.
