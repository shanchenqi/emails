No public security notification outside of the release notes and a few tweets, it seems. :(  Rack::Attack does not normalize paths before processing them, meaning that if there is a throttle or block rule for /login, a malicious user could use /login/ to bypass the check. This only affects Rails applications.  More details:  Fixed by:  Related tweets:   This could almost be categorized as "Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name", but it's not really authentication here. I couldn't find a better CWE without getting too generic.  Needs a CVE assigned.  ~reed   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
