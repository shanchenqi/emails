Can you assign CVE ids to these?  can lead to a heap overflow via malformed dhcp responses later in print_option (via dhcp_envoption1) due to incorrect option length values. exploitation is non-trivial, but i'd love to be proven wrong.  can lead to an invalid read/crash via malformed dhcp responses. not exploitable beyond DoS as far as I can judge.
