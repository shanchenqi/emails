I've also re-attached the PoC that was attached to the original message.  Apparently, the issue was also reported on December 24 here:   The reason for the false spam detection turned out to be the Chinese charset.  We expect only English messages on most Openwall mailing lists, so the following non-English charsets commonly seen in spam arriving to our lists are currently treated as spam indicators:  koi8-* shift_jis big-5  These may or may not trigger spam detection depending on more factors, which is why some other messages by the same sender made it through.  Unfortunately, this detection may sometimes be triggered on mostly-English messages that have one of these charsets specified for the message body (as it was in this case) or the message Subject.  For now, my advice is to avoid using these non-English charsets when posting to English-only mailing lists.  We might reconsider the anti-spam settings, although so far they've been reasonably effective and such misdetection appears rare.  ----- Forwarded message from limingxing <limingxing@....cn> -----  From: limingxing <limingxing@....cn> To: "oss-security@...ts.openwall.com" <oss-security@...ts.openwall.com> CC: ?????? <huangyonggang@....cn> Subject: Integer overflow in the JasPer's jas_matrix_create() function Date: Thu, 31 Dec  Hello, We find a vulnerability in the way JasPer's jas_matrix_create() function parsed certain JPEG image files.   jas_matrix_t *jas_matrix_create(int numrows, int numcols) { 	.......  	if (matrix->maxrows_ > 0) { 		if (!(matrix->rows_ = jas_malloc(matrix->maxrows_ * 		  sizeof(jas_seqent_t *)))) {          ................  matrix->maxrows_ > 0 ,but matrix->maxrows_ *sizeof(jas_seqent_t *) can cause Integer overflow.  Despite this library is used by many programs (http://www.ece.uvic.ca/~frodo/jasper/#overview), there is no one providing support.
