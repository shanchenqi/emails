For example:    Paths like .., ../.. or // are not sanitized correctly    The program crashes if a path doesn't start with base_prefix instead of showing an error message    On MS Windows the filesystem backend allows access to the first level of files on a drive.    Improve the regex used for well-known URIs    Decouple the daemon from its parent environment    Avoid race condition in PID file creation  are missing information about the attacker and/or the impact.    These might potentially be overlapping observations:    Paths like .., ../.. or // are not sanitized correctly    Improve the regex used for well-known URIs    Prevent crafted HTTP request from calling arbitrary functions    Improve URI sanitation and conversion to filesystem path      For now, we will start with two CVE IDs for the change information that seems somewhat more clear:  - The multifilesystem backend allows access to arbitrary files on all platforms.  - Prevent regex injection in rights management  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  /Xvt2kqc2sHESQq+kDhG =HPXl -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
