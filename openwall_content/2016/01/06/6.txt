That's bad.  It is a pain but it is perfectly possible to: 	/* Mess with caps so the next line does not clear CAP_SYS_ADMIN */ 	setresuid(container_root_uid, container_root_uid); 	setns(some_userns);  And it all works without issue.  > You can't stop the container from messing with you in general (by > ptracing later - though as you say we could set nodump, but I don't > think people would want htat), but it shouldn't be able to mess with the > host root uid.  It is a very reasonable extension and it makes it much harder to get it all wrong.  But that is very different from saying the kernel today is broken.  It really is the responsibility of the party that calls setns(some_userns) to make certain their process does not have anything you don't want the root user in the container to get his hands on.  That goes way beyond the root uid.  In the original conversation about all of this the issue that was raised that we might not know which process the user namespace belongs to and so might not be able to call setresuid(container_root_uid, container_root_uid)  ahead of time because of lack of knowledge.  I am concerned that the responsibility to not be stupid when you call setns(some_userns) is being lost.
