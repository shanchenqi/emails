Last year, I found that it failed to compare MACs in constant-time (which is rule #1 of the cryptography coding standards, by the way). This is not only a remotely exploitable cryptographic side-channel that allows for MAC forgeries that result in chosen-ciphertext attacks, but it's also a sign of poor security engineering that promises more vulnerabilities will be discovered in other components.  Today, I spend two minutes looking through the C and Python versions and discovered they are also susceptible to timing attack vulnerabilities.  * *  And of course, my original finding:  I'd like to take this opportunity to tell every programmer and information security professional that reads this mailing list: DON'T USE RNCRYPTOR.  If you need portable, highly secure cryptography, there is no better answer than libsodium:  (If you're interested in seeing the Stack Exchange discussion:  Scott Arciszewski Chief Development Officer Paragon Initiative Enterprises <https://paragonie.com>   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
