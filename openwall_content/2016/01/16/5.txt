Setgid directories are rare, user "man" is rarely used, so escalation risk is not so high. Apart from that, it was unclear, what would be correct behavior regarding POSIX.  Later on in [1], using the very same method with overlayfs was suitable to escalate from any user to root.  After looking at that more closely, I found today another method to escalate e.g. on Ubuntu Trusty/Wily to any group to be found with "find / -perm this is e.g. staff, mail, libuuid. As staff is has rwx permissions on python dist-packages and /var/local, any root process accessing those is at high risk to be used to escalate to uid root also.  Hence it seems, that the problem [0] increases the attack surface in general. Should it therefore be treated as a security vulnerability and assigned a CVE?
