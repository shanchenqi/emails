The staff group on Debian derivatives like Ubuntu is meant to be root-equivalent anyway[1] (see /usr/share/doc/base-passwd/users-and-groups.txt.gz for details of what this group means). If you want to escalate from staff to root, there's no need to use clever tricks like these, because staff has write access to directories on root's default PATH.  There is a long-term plan to make everything that is currently root:staff instead be root:root, at least on new installations but it was being done gradually to avoid breaking existing systems where the sysadmin might be relying on the staff group's current functionality, and unfortunately it now seems to have stalled altogether. I'll contact that bug and try to get things moving again.
