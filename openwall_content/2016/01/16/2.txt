I have tried it, but it seems too unspecific. Example from the cron jobs directory:  W: [privileged_change_privileges] cron-system /etc/cron.daily/dpkg (root) and does not attempt to change privileges  This is reported nearly for all scripts, for some it might be a correct finding, for others it is simply wrong (they should really operate with root permissions in place). So it is not very effective in pointing at the really problematic scripts.  Of course a project developer could take all the collected warnings as "checklist", if they might apply to his project's scripts also.  (And they could be made a little more targeted by upc: e.g. report only if the script uses chown with non-root UIDs or chmod/find/rm .. on directories not owned by root. But that needs quite a lot of parsing of the scripts.)  Conclusio on upc in that case could be: Good to scan new project software as a second line of defense and to get ideas, which errors one could have made but not helpful to point at specific locations.  - --  http://www.halfdog.net/ PGP: AE98 B91F FE88  2BD8 feed a bee -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =X8za -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
