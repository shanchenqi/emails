A concern here is that this might increase side-channel leaks.  Related discussion:   I guess you intend to be careful with that?  > The CVE issue descriptions and fixes are linked below.

OK, launched another browser. ;-)  Alexander  P.S. My extra excuse to post this and to over-quote is DMARC, which has likely prevented delivery of the original @google.com message to some recipients.  I know I got to workaround it in list configuration soon.
