Reflected Cross Site Scripting & Header Injection in Mimetype Query String [Katowicz-Kowalewski]  The ui-blob handler accepted a mimetype as a query string and then echoed this string verbatim back. A malicious user could provide a string like:     This has been fixed by removing support for the mimetype query string parameter: And then restricting to only generic mimetypes: And finally, just in case, setting the IE anti-sniffing header as well as a restrictive CSP header:   2. Stored Cross Site Scripting & Header Injection in Filename Parameter [Donenfeld]  A user who has write access to the git repository could create filenames containing new lines that would result in that filename, including the newlines, being included in a header, resulting in header injection and eventually XSS.  This has been fixed by properly escaping filenames in headers: Additionally, while the redirect for the /about -> /about/ page does *not* appear to be vulnerable due to mitigating conditions, the following commit was made to similarly harden potential injections here:  3. Stored Cross Site Scripting in Git Repo Files [Katowicz-Kowalewski]  A user who has write access to the git repository can add HTML pages and then serve them with an HTML mimetype. A user could therefore upload pages with malicious javascript executing in the same origin as the cgit web site. While this is ordinarily not a problem for single-use users - and indeed some users rather like being able to serve html from cgit - sites that allow potentially malicious third party users may not find this behavior desirable.  This has been fixed by adding a configuration option, "enable-html-serving", which is by default off: This flag sets anti-sniffing, CSP, and restricts mimetypes to non-"application/" (except for application/pdf and application/octet-stream) and non-"text/" (except for text/plain). If you have a better idea of what sort of white/black list to use for this, I am open to suggestions.  4. Integer Overflow resulting in Buffer Overflow [Cabetas]  ctx.env.content_length is an unsigned int, coming from the CONTENT_LENGTH environment variable, which is parsed by strtoul. The HTTP/1.1 spec says that "any Content-Length greater than or equal to zero is a valid value." By storing this unsigned int into an int, we potentially overflow it, resulting in the following bounding check failing, leading to a buffer overflow.  This has been fixed by this commit:   A new version containing these security fixes will be published shortly.
