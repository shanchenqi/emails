Use for the concat issue (which is fully described in the reference) and for the subfile issue (which is mentioned but not described in the reference).  The essential problem is that a crafted file forces the victim to visit an arbitrary external URL, but this URL is constructed using data from the victim's local filesystem.   >  This might describe a vulnerability, but we aren't sure whether the access to file:///home/ctf/flag.txt is really unintended FFmpeg behavior. This might be better modeled as a site-specific vulnerability in the web service, because it should have arranged for the file:///home/ctf/flag.txt URL to be interpreted within an appropriately safe sandbox context.  Similarly, the reports of FFmpeg SSRF in might be better modeled as site-specific vulnerabilities within the "online video conversion" web application.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =rHFW -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
