ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The PV superpage functionality lacks certain validity checks on data being passed to the hypervisor by guests.  This is the case for the page identifier (MFN) passed to MMUEXT_MARK_SUPER and MMUEXT_UNMARK_SUPER sub-ops of the HYPERVISOR_mmuext_op hypercall as well as for various forms of page table updates.  IMPACT ======  Use of the feature, which is disabled by default, may have unknown effects, ranging from information leaks through Denial of Service to privilege escalation.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Only systems which enable the PV superpage feature are affected.  That is, only systems with an `allowsuperpage' setting on the hypervisor command line.  Note that in Xen 4.0.x and 3.4.x the option is named `allowhugepage'.  Xen versions and from 4.1 onwards are affected.  Only x86 systems are affected.  Only PV guests can exploit the vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only HVM guests will avoid this issue.  Not enabling PV superpage support (by omitting the `allowsuperpage' or `allowhugepage' hypervisor command line options) will avoid exposing the issue.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Qinghao Tang of Marvel Team.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            xen-unstable       Xen 4.6.x, 4.5.x       Xen 4.4.x, 4.3.x  $    $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.   However deployment of the SUPERPAGE DISABLEMENT MITIGATION is NOT permitted (except where all the affected systems and VMs are administered and used only by organisations which are members of the Xen Project Security Issues Predisclosure List).  Specifically, deployment on public cloud systems is NOT permitted.  This is because disabling PV superpage support is visible to guests, so such deployment could lead to the rediscovery of the vulnerability.  Deployment of the mitigation is permitted only AFTER the embargo ends.   Also: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.   (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
