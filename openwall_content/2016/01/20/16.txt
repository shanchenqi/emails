If you use L.mapbox.map or L.mapbox.tileLayer to load untrusted TileJSON   content from a non-Mapbox URL, it is possible for a malicious user with   control over the TileJSON content to inject script content into the   "attribution" value of the TileJSON which will be executed in the context of   the page using Mapbox.js.    Such usage is uncommon. The following usage scenarios are not vulnerable:    * only trusted TileJSON content is loaded   * TileJSON content comes only from mapbox.com URLs   * a Mapbox map ID is supplied, rather than a TileJSON URL    Remediation:    Upgrade to Mapbox.js version If you are still using a 1.x version and   unable to upgrade to upgrade to    Credit: John Firebaugh   * Content Injection via TileJSON Name    https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/74    Overview:    Mapbox.js versions 1.x prior to and 2.x prior to are vulnerable   to a cross-site-scripting attack in certain uncommon usage scenarios.    If you use L.mapbox.map and L.mapbox.shareControl it is possible for a   malicious user with control over the TileJSON content to inject script   content into the name value of the TileJSON. After clicking on the share   control, the malicious code will execute in the context of the page using   Mapbox.js.    Such usage is uncommon. L.mapbox.shareControl is not automatically added to   mapbox.js maps and must be explicitly added. The following usage scenarios   are not vulnerable:    * the map does not use a share control (L.mapbox.sharecontrol)   * only trusted TileJSON content is loaded    Remediation:    Upgrade to Mapbox.js version If you are still using a 1.x version and   unable to upgrade to upgrade to    If you are unable to upgrade to either or you can also remove   instances of L.mapbox.shareControl from your maps.
