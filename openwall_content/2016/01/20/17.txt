By repeatedly requesting and interrupting connections to a Large Object (Dynamic or Static) URL, a remote attacker may exhausts Swift proxy-server resources, potentially resulting in a denial of service. Note that there are two distinct bugs that can exhaust proxy resources, one for client connection (client to proxy), one for servers connection (proxy to server). All Swift setup are affected.   Patches ~~~~~~~ - (client to proxy) (Kilo) - (proxy to server) (Kilo) - (proxy to server) (Liberty) - (proxy to server) (Mitaka)   Credits ~~~~~~~ - Romain LE DISEZ from OVH - Ărjan Persson from Kiliaro   References ~~~~~~~~~~ - (client to proxy) - (proxy to server) - (client   to proxy) - (proxy to   server)   Notes ~~~~~ - The client to proxy issue is already fixed in Liberty - The remaining fix will be included in future (Kilo) and   (Liberty) releases.  --  Tristan Cacqueray OpenStack Vulnerability Management Team   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
