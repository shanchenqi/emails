Homepage: https://github.com/square/git-fastclone  Download: https://rubygems.org/gems/git-fastclone  * git-fastclone permits arbitrary shell command execution from .gitmodules    https://github.com/square/git-fastclone/pull/2    git-fastclone before uses the git URL provided without validating   the protocol being requested, which allows for executing arbitrary code   found in the URL (such as with the 'ext' protocol).    This is basically the same issue as just in a different   client implementation. What's policy here? Should a new CVE be assigned?    Fixed in Affects all previous versions.  * git-fastclone permits arbitrary shell command execution via shell   metacharacter injection into variables/parameters    https://github.com/square/git-fastclone/pull/5    git-fastclone before passes user modifiable strings directly to a shell   command. An attacker can execute malicious commands by modifying the   strings that are passed as arguments to "cd " and "git clone " commands in   the library.    No CVE has been assigned.    Fixed in Affects all previous versions.  Can CVE(s) be assigned, as needed?
