It checks that the certificate belongs to the host that the client wants to connect to. This validation, of course, should normally always be enabled to prevent MITM attacks.  Recently (end of November) two security researchers Paul Kehrer and Alex Gaynor have found a flaw in this certificate validation code that allows to trick it into accepting certificate from other hosts. For example, if the host 'foo.com' has a certificate with the "Organizational Unit" being, say, "/CN=bar.com", then MariaDB client will see the result as     /OU=/CN=bar.com/CN=foo.com  and will think that this certificate belongs to bar.com. This bugs is in 15 year old code and is present in all MariaDB/MySQL/Percona Server versions.   This vulnerability got  It is fixed in MariaDB MariaDB MariaDB (all released in December).
