An if checks if it is necessary to reallocate memory in the target buffer. However this check is off by one, therefore an out of bounds write happens.  Upstream has released version to fix this.  I have checked where this function gets used. I didn't find any code using it, so I assume the impact is limited.  This bug was found with the help of Address Sanitizer.   --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
