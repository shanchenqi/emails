The reverse DNS, in my understanding could point to anything, including "localhost" and "example.org". It only gets confirmed by doing another DNS request, a forward lookup, for the previously received FQDN and comparing it to the initial IPv6 address.  In the example at hand this fails, as a lookup yields: analog.data.shodan.io has no AAAA record While whois data for the IPv6 address shows this to be a digitalocean droplet, just like mentioned by the linked blogpost regarding the other addresses. So there is no obvious association with Shodan.   > (Upon querying this server for NTP, the machine immediately got > IPv6-scanned by rock.scan6.shodan.io) >  > pool.ntp.org services are the default NTP servers in many default > configurations (at least most of Linux distro) and I guess that > this kind of behavior is dangerously increasing the exposure level > of way too many systems. >  > For ntp.org admins: can those rogue server be expunged from the > pools, and the whole shodan.io situation clarified?

This could clarify the above issue.   - From a security PoV I find this a fascinating and efficient approach to finding hosts in, by design, sparsely populated IPv6 subnets. Just goes to show, that if you don't want scans to reach your network, you should run a perimeter firewall (determining sensible rules is on another page) .
