Nested attributes rejection proc bypass in Active Record.  There is a vulnerability in how the nested attributes feature in Active Record handles updates in combination with destroy flags when destroying records is disabled. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier  Versions Affected:  and newer Not affected:       3.0.x and older Fixed Versions:      Impact ------ When using the nested attributes feature in Active Record you can prevent the destruction of associated records by passing the `allow_destroy: false` option to the `accepts_nested_attributes_for` method. However due to a change in the commit the `_destroy` flag prevents the `:reject_if` proc from being called because it assumes that the record will be destroyed anyway.  However this isn't true if `:allow_destroy` is false so this leads to changes that would have been rejected being applied to the record. Attackers could use this do things like set attributes to invalid values and to clear all of the attributes amongst other things. The severity will be dependent on how the application has used this feature.  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.  Releases -------- The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds ----------- If you can't upgrade, please use the following monkey patch in an initializer that is loaded before your application:  ``` $ cat config/initializers/nested_attributes_bypass_fix.rb module ActiveRecord   module NestedAttributes     private      def reject_new_record?(association_name, attributes)       will_be_destroyed?(association_name, attributes) || call_reject_if(association_name, attributes)     end      def call_reject_if(association_name, attributes)       return false if will_be_destroyed?(association_name, attributes)        case callback = self.nested_attributes_options[association_name][:reject_if]       when Symbol         method(callback).arity == 0 ? send(callback) : send(callback, attributes)       when Proc         callback.call(attributes)       end     end      def will_be_destroyed?(association_name, attributes)       allow_destroy?(association_name) && has_destroy_flag?(attributes)     end      def allow_destroy?(association_name)       self.nested_attributes_options[association_name][:allow_destroy]     end   end end ```  Patches ------- To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.  * 3-2-nested-attributes-reject-if-bypass.patch - Patch for 3.2 series * 4-1-nested-attributes-reject-if-bypass.patch - Patch for 4.1 series * 4-2-nested-attributes-reject-if-bypass.patch - Patch for 4.2 series * 5-0-nested-attributes-reject-if-bypass.patch - Patch for 5.0 series  Please note that only the 4.1.x and 4.2.x series are supported at present. Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.
