Gday,  I would like a CVE for the following issue:  An issue with ASN1.1 DER decoder was reported that a specially created key can lead to a kernel panic via certificate DER signature parsing.  Vulnerable code:  ... int public_key_verify_signature(const struct public_key *pk,                                 const struct public_key_signature *sig) {         const struct public_key_algorithm *algo;          BUG_ON(!pk);         BUG_ON(!pk->mpi[0]);    An attacker could craft a BER file without a public key and panic the system.    There is no patch upstream at the time of writing.
