Timing attack vulnerability in basic authentication in Action Controller.  There is a timing attack vulnerability in the basic authentication support in Action Controller. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier  Versions Affected:  All. Not affected:       None. Fixed Versions:      Impact ------ Due to the way that Action Controller compares user names and passwords in basic authentication authorization code, it is possible for an attacker to analyze the time taken by a response and intuit the password.  For example, this string comparison:    "foo" == "bar"  is possibly faster than this comparison:    "foo" == "fo1"  Attackers can use this information to attempt to guess the username and password used in the basic authentication system.  You can tell you application is vulnerable to this attack by looking for `http_basic_authenticate_with` method calls in your application.  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.  Releases -------- The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds ----------- If you can't upgrade, please use the following monkey patch in an initializer that is loaded before your application:  ``` $ cat config/initializers/basic_auth_fix.rb module ActiveSupport   module SecurityUtils     def secure_compare(a, b)       return false unless a.bytesize == b.bytesize        l = a.unpack "C#{a.bytesize}"        res = 0       b.each_byte { |byte| res |= byte ^ l.shift }       res == 0     end     module_function :secure_compare      def variable_size_secure_compare(a, b)           end     module_function :variable_size_secure_compare   end end  module ActionController   class Base     def self.http_basic_authenticate_with(options = {})       before_action(options.except(:name, :password, :realm)) do         authenticate_or_request_with_http_basic(options[:realm] || "Application") do |name, password|           # This comparison uses & so that it doesn't short circuit and           # uses `variable_size_secure_compare` so that length information           # isn't leaked.           ActiveSupport::SecurityUtils.variable_size_secure_compare(name, options[:name]) &             ActiveSupport::SecurityUtils.variable_size_secure_compare(password, options[:password])         end       end     end   end end ```   Patches ------- To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.  * 4-1-basic_auth.patch - Patch for 4.1 series * 4-2-basic_auth.patch - Patch for 4.2 series * 5-0-basic_auth.patch - Patch for 5.0 series  Please note that only the 4.1.x and 4.2.x series are supported at present. Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.
