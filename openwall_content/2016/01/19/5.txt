By referencing a local file like /dev/zero, an authenticated user may trick the heat engine service to load arbitrary local file content resulting in a Denial of Service attack through memory exhaustion. Note that the file content is not written back to the user, though the user can determine if a file exists and if it is readable by heat-engine. All Heat setups are affected.
