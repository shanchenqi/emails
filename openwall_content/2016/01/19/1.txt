These can allow a user to DoS the system.  Please assign CVEs to the issues listed below. Thanks.  (the link is dead,  should contain the information)  ----- Forwarded message from Takashi Iwai -----  - NULL dereference via ALSA sequencer access:     ('sound: GPF in snd_seq_fifo_clear')    The fix is on Linus tree,   commit     ALSA: seq: Fix missing NULL check at remove_events ioctl  - Race at ALSA sequencer timer setup and close:     ('sound: use-after-free in snd_timer_stop')    The fix is on Linus tree,   commit     ALSA: seq: Fix race at timer setup and close  - Race among ALSA timer ioctls:   this is triggered by a few different fuzzer cases, and involved with   multiple fix commits.      ('sound: use-after-free in snd_timer_interrupt')      ('sound: GPF in snd_timer_user_params')      ('sound: use-after-free in snd_timer_user_ioctl')    The fixes are the following commits on Linus tree,       ALSA: timer: Fix double unlink of active_list        ALSA: timer: Fix race among timer ioctls        ALSA: timer: Harden slave timer list handling  - Deadlock at ALSA hrtimer concurrent accesses:     ('sound: spinlock lockup in sound/core/timer.c')    Further tracked at the thread      The fix is in sound git tree for-linus branch, will send a pull   request in a couple of days:   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tiwai/sound.git      commit     ALSA: hrtimer: Fix stall by hrtimer_cancel()   ----- End forwarded message -----  Johannes --  GPG Key       EE16 6BCE AD56 BFB3  3ADD 7BF7 E7C8 1FA0 Subkey fingerprint:    F7CE 6F1E  BC27 DD9D 2CC4 FD66 SUSE Linux GmbH, GF: Felix Imendörffer, Jane Smithard, Graham Norton HRB (AG Nürnberg)  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
