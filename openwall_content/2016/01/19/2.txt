Gday,  It was reported that possible use-after-free vulnerability in keyring facility, possibly leading to local privilege escalation was found. The function join_session_keyring in security/keys/process_keys.c holds a reference to the requested keyring, but if that keyring is the same as the one being currently used by the process, the kernel wouldn't decrease keyring->usage before returning to userspace. The usage field can be overflowed causing use-after-free on the keyring object.  This was introduced in commit  Perception point reported this vulnerability to Red Hat and it has been assigned    Red Hat Bugzilla flaw:   Investigation:   Patches will be available shortly with the upstream fix and are also explained in the investigation link above.
