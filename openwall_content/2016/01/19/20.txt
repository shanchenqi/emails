CVE:                   Document Version:      2.0 Posting date:          19 January Program Impacted:      BIND Versions affected:     Severity:              Medium Exploitable:           Remotely  Description:     In versions of BIND errors can occur when OPT pseudo-RR    data or ECS options are formatted to text.  In through    the issue may result in a REQUIRE assertion failure    in buffer.c. In prior versions, it may result in named    crashing (such as with a segmentation fault) or other misbehavior    due to a buffer overrun.  Impact:     This issue can affect both authoritative and recursive servers    if they are performing debug logging. (It may also crash related    tools which use the same code, such as dig or delv.)  CVSS Score:            5.4 CVSS Vector:           (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)  For more information on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System and to obtain your specific environmental score please visit: http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&adv&version=2&vector=(AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)  Workarounds:     can be avoided in named by disabling debug logging.  Active exploits:     No known active exploits.  Solution:     Upgrade to the patched release most closely related to your    current version of BIND.
