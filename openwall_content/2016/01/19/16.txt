It's January 19, and OpenCart proper is still doing it wrong.   What this line tries to do is prevent directory traversal attacks by stripping out ../, but unfortunately it's quite dumb.  https://3v4l.org/tMmNK  This also doesn't defend against NUL byte injections.  This is a 0day, because Daniel Kerr usually just flames security researchers and I didn't feel like subjecting myself to that ever again. To wit:  * * * * *  I'm sure I missed quite a few instances of him flaming people trying to help him secure his project for free. He doesn't seem to ever learn, either.  The OpenCart-CE maintainer, in contrast, is more hospitable towards security researchers. So in addition to already having a fix in place, their rapport with the community means using the community edition is likely to make your system more secure than running OpenCart proper.  In closing, I recommend everyone who runs OpenCart to switch to OpenCart-CE today and anyone who does penetration testing read this excellent article by Keith Makan about Ordering an RFI via Email:  Scott Arciszewski Chief Development Officer Paragon Initiative Enterprises <https://paragonie.com>   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
