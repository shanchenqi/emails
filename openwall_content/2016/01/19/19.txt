Reed" <jreed@....org> To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: Specific APL data could trigger an INSIST in apl_42.c  causing BIND named to exit  CVE:                   Document Version:      2.0 Posting date:          19 January Program Impacted:      BIND Versions affected:                            Severity:              High Exploitable:           Remotely  Description:     A buffer size check used to guard against overflow could cause    named to exit with an INSIST failure In apl_42.c.  Impact:     A server could exit due to an INSIST failure in apl_42.c when    performing certain string formatting operations.  Examples include    (but may not be limited to):      -  Slaves using text-format db files could be vulnerable if        receiving a malformed record in a zone transfer from their master.      -  Masters using text-format db files could be vulnerable if        they accept a malformed record in a DDNS update message.      -  Recursive resolvers are potentially vulnerable when debug        logging, if they are fed a deliberately malformed record by        a malicious server.      -  A server which has cached a specially constructed record        could encounter this condition while performing 'rndc dumpdb'.  Please Note:     Versions of BIND from 9.3 through 9.8 are also affected, but    these branches are beyond their "end of life" (EOL) and no longer    receive testing or security fixes from ISC. For current information    on which versions are actively supported, please see    http://www.isc.org/downloads/.
