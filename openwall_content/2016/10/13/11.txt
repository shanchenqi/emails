If a packet has the layout: | IPv4 header | GRE header | IPv4 header | GRE header | ... depending on left over stack it could run the kernel out of stack due to recursion and so crash the kernel. This might be hard to hit with regular Ethernet MTUs, but easier with Jumbo frames.  Michal has a testcase in    As far as I see fixed in 4.6, introduced in  commit Author: Jesse Gross <jesse@...nel.org> Date:   Sat Mar 19      tunnels: Don't apply GRO to multiple layers of encapsulation.          When drivers express support for TSO of encapsulated packets, they     only mean that they can do it for one layer of encapsulation.     Supporting additional levels would mean updating, at a minimum,     more IP length fields and they are unaware of this.          No encapsulation device expresses support for handling offloaded     encapsulated packets, so we won't generate these types of frames     in the transmit path. However, GRO doesn't have a check for     multiple levels of encapsulation and will attempt to build them.          UDP tunnel GRO actually does prevent this situation but it only     handles multiple UDP tunnels stacked on top of each other. This     generalizes that solution to prevent any kind of tunnel stacking     that would cause problems.
