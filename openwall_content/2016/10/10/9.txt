D-Bus <http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/> is an asynchronous inter-process communication system, commonly used for system services or within a desktop session on Linux and other operating systems.  A format string vulnerability in the reference bus implementation, dbus-daemon, could potentially allow local users to cause arbitrary code execution or denial of service.  In versions of dbus-daemon that are also vulnerable to this format string vulnerability is available to all local users. These versions should be patched or updated immediately.  In versions of dbus-daemon where was already fixed, this is not believed to be exploitable in practice, because the relevant message is ignored unless it comes from the owner of the bus name org.freedesktop.systemd1. On the system bus, this bus name is only allowed to be owned by uid 0; it is intended to be owned by systemd, and no mechanism is currently known by which an attacker who does not already have root privileges could induce systemd to send messages that would trigger the format string vulnerability.  Patching or updating dbus-daemon is strongly recommended. A minimal patch is attached to this advisory.  Please reference fd.o or in any notices that refer to this vulnerability.
