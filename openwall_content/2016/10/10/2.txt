Full advisory and a working root privilege escalation exploit can be found at:    BTW. If you are using Tomcat on a Debian-based distro,  you may want to check out my previous Tomcat advisory and exploit at:    --  Regards, Dawid Golunski http://legalhackers.com  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
