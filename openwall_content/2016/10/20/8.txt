This is in reference to this Debian bug:     I assumed it was a Debian-specific backporting problem, affecting only the LTS branch of the previous (non-current) stable release.  It did not occur to me that this was an independent bugfix which happened upstream some time ago, and that affected software versions are still widely deployed.
