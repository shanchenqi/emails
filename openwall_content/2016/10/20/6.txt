A validation step occurs for every URI, and the amount of memory allocated is correct for the set of validated URIs, but there is simply no data model for the set of validated URIs. (Conceivably, the set of validated URIs could be in its own array, or each URI in the original array could have a flag indicating whether it was valid.)  Use  As mentioned, this has a resultant heap buffer overflow.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  1shVmylDTkJ5tLBQwHmM =WKq1 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
