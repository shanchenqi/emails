It seems the only thing the attacker could do here, is self-dos his own connection. Regarding consuming memory on the server, by opening several concurrent connections at the same time, there are various protections available in opensshd_config file, such as "MaxStartups", which can limit the maximum number of sessions per network connections.  This value is effectively set to so maximum of * MB can be allocated, which is pretty much for unauthenticated user. Though the rate limiting starts to drop connection after 10, which is like 1GB and which should not hurt the server (though it is not cool).      --  Huzaifa Sidhpurwala / Red Hat Product Security Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
