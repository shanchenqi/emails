Last week we notified the related list, distros@...openwall.org, about a vulnerability found in ISC BIND releases produced before change which first appeared in May  Although all of ISC's BIND releases since that date have been immune to the vulnerability, several OS distribution packagers were maintaining BIND packages which were forked from ISC's source line before that change and so we notified that list to give packagers warning before our public disclosure of the vulnerability.  As we previously announced it was our intention to do, we have publicly disclosed today.  Since information concerning the vulnerability, including a reproduction script, exists in a public bug repository we urge you to update vulnerable binary packages as soon as possible.  Thank you.
