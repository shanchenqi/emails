The happens because no essential check for duplicated image ID found in  getAncestry() in docker2aci,   was assigned to this flaw by cve-assign@...re.org<mailto:cve-assign@...re.org>. Here the reply from CVE Assignment Team:  docker2aci is apparently a library [...] and we almost always recognize  the potential for an unattended use case for any library.  [...]  Someone can call the ConvertSavedFile function from an arbitrary  application. [...] It might be automated with cron or a similar unattended  tool that runs in an unrestricted (non-container) environment. Thus,  there is an availability impact because no human is around to notice  the CPU usage.    Use   References:    Please, use it in the public communications regarding this flaw.
