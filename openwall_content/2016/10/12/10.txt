It is free software, distributed under the GNU/GPL licence.  ### Vulnerability Description  It's possible to send HTTP/FTP requests using the `valider_xml` file. Attackers can make it look like the server is sending the request, possibly bypassing access controls such as a firewall that would prevent the attacker from accessing the URLs directly.  **Access Vector**: remote  **Security Risk**: medium  **Vulnerability**:  **CVSS Base Score**: 5.5 (Medium)  **CVE-ID**:  ### Proof of Concept      http://spip-dev.srv/ecrire/?exec=valider_xml&var_url=http://router-dev.srv/     http://spip-dev.srv/ecrire/?exec=valider_xml&var_url=ftp://ftp.debian.org/   ### Vulnerable code  The FTP connection is initialized by the `is_dir` function inside `valider_xml`, line 79 :      if (is_dir($url)) {  Other PHP Wrappers supporting `is_dir` can be called using this function.  The HTTP connection is initiated at line      $res = $transformer_xml(recuperer_page($url));  ### Timeline (dd/mm/yyyy)  * : Initial discovery * : Contact with SPIP Team * : Answer from SPIP Team, sent advisory details * : Server Side Request Forgery vulnerability correct vulnerabilities. * : SPIP Released  ### Fixes  * *  ### Affected versions  * Version <=  ### Credits  * Nicolas CHATELAIN, Sysdream (n.chatelain -at- sysdream -dot- com)   --  SYSDREAM Labs <labs@...dream.com>  GPG : C43E 2A2E 8EB4 8CD9 D5B2  * Website: https://sysdream.com/ * Twitter: @sysdream            Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
