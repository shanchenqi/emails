To reproduce (tested in revision  $ echo | valgrind --quiet ./build/mujs Argument 'size' of function malloc has a fishy (possibly negative) value:    at malloc (in /usr/lib/valgrind/vgpreload_memcheck-amd64-linux.so)    by js_regcomp (in /home/g/Work/Code/mujs/build/mujs)    by js_newregexp (in /home/g/Work/Code/mujs/build/mujs)    by jsR_run (in /home/g/Work/Code/mujs/build/mujs)    by js_call (in /home/g/Work/Code/mujs/build/mujs)    by js_pcall (in /home/g/Work/Code/mujs/build/mujs)    by eval_print (in /home/g/Work/Code/mujs/build/mujs)    by main (in /home/g/Work/Code/mujs/build/mujs) Invalid write of size 2    at js_regcomp (in /home/g/Work/Code/mujs/build/mujs)    by js_newregexp (in /home/g/Work/Code/mujs/build/mujs)    by jsR_run (in /home/g/Work/Code/mujs/build/mujs)    by js_call (in /home/g/Work/Code/mujs/build/mujs)    by js_pcall (in /home/g/Work/Code/mujs/build/mujs)    by eval_print (in /home/g/Work/Code/mujs/build/mujs)    by main (in /home/g/Work/Code/mujs/build/mujs)  Address 0x2 is not stack'd, malloc'd or (recently) free'd Process terminating with default action of signal 11 (SIGSEGV)  Access not within mapped region at address 0x2    at js_regcomp (in /home/g/Work/Code/mujs/build/mujs)    by js_newregexp (in /home/g/Work/Code/mujs/build/mujs)    by jsR_run (in /home/g/Work/Code/mujs/build/mujs)    by js_call (in /home/g/Work/Code/mujs/build/mujs)    by js_pcall (in /home/g/Work/Code/mujs/build/mujs)    by eval_print (in /home/g/Work/Code/mujs/build/mujs)    by main (in /home/g/Work/Code/mujs/build/mujs)  This test case was found using QuickFuzz.
