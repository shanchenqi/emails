Unfortunately, it still didn't work on systems without O_TMPFILE or/and without a defined PR_SET_PTRACER_ANY.  Attached is a slightly more portable version.  > It's an improved > version of the test case I originally sent out to distros (oops!).  Why "oops"?  Do you mean just the distros vs. linux-distros issue?  It's OK to send reproducers to the [linux-]distros list (the appropriate one) as long as you intend to make them public shortly after public disclosure of the issue itself (the earliest of: a few days or when other public exploits/reproducers show up).  I think for most issues, which are not high impact or/and where non-trivial pre-conditions need to be met, it makes sense to make the (non-weaponized) reproducers public right away (on the initial public disclosure date, along with full vulnerability detail), but occasionally there will be issues like this where delaying posting the reproducer a little bit makes sense. It's just that I think you shouldn't have delayed as much.  Ideally, you should have made a posting in here without the reproducer on the initial public disclosure date (in fact, that's your responsibility per the [linux-]distros list policy), and as others made reproducers available within a day, you should have also posted yours the next day.  Just my opinion.  Thank you for your help in handling of this issue!
