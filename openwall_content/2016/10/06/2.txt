Yes:  the use of comp0size under-allocates buffers for components 1..N, which are then overflowed in later processing.  using from https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg-data/tree/master/input/nonregression/  $ valgrind j2k_to_image -i -o o.ppm [INFO] tile 1 of 1 Invalid write of size 4    at t1_decode_cblks    by tcd_decode_tile    by j2k_read_eoc    by j2k_decode    by opj_jp2_decode    by opj_decode_with_info    by opj_decode    by main  Address is 0 bytes after a block of size alloc'd    at malloc (in    by tcd_decode_tile    by j2k_read_eoc    by j2k_decode    by opj_jp2_decode    by opj_decode_with_info    by opj_decode    by main    --  Doran Moppert Red Hat Product Security  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
