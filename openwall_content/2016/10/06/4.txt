The virtual host name and the URI are concatenated to create a virtual host mapping rule. The length checks prior to writing to the target buffer for this rule did not take account of the length of the virtual host name, creating the potential for a buffer overflow. It is not known if this overflow is exploitable.  Mitigation Users of affected versions should apply one of the following mitigations - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat JK ISAPI Connector - Where available, use IIS configuration to restrict the maximum URI   length to - (the length of the longest virtual host name)  Credit: This issue was discovered by The Apache Tomcat Security Team.
