It was tested in ArchLinux In this odd issue, the interaction between librsvg and cairo is somehow causing the function png_write_row in libpng to write out of bounds. To reproduce:  $ gdb --args rsvg-convert -o /dev/null libpng-crash.svg ... Thread 1 "rsvg-convert" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault. in __memmove_sse2_unaligned_erms () from /usr/lib/libc.so.6 (gdb) bt #0  in __memmove_sse2_unaligned_erms () from /usr/lib/libc.so.6 #1  in png_write_row () from #2  in png_write_image () from #3  in ?? () from /usr/lib/libcairo.so.2 #4  in cairo_surface_write_to_png_stream () from /usr/lib/libcairo.so.2 #5  in ?? () #6  in __libc_start_main () from /usr/lib/libc.so.6 #7  in ?? ()   I don't think there is bug in libpng, but i'm not sure where the other libraries are failing. Interestingly enough, there is no indication of invalid memory reads or writes before the crash. The compressed reproducer is attached. Hopefully someone will be able to find and isolate this vulnerability.  Regards, Gustavo.
