We are aware of:         and these seem to indicate separate findings related to three items on your list. Thus, we can initially assign these IDs:  > * Cross-Site Request Forgery  Use   > * Reflected Cross-Site Scripting  Use   > * File Enumeration / Path Traversal  Use   Is your reported Server Side Request Forgery a completely separate problem? Is it resultant from an authorization issue, e.g., possibly the wrong users have access to XML validation:    -   if (!autoriser('sauvegarder')) {   +   if (!autoriser('webmestre')) {  and also XML validation could be performed through CSRF? In other words, is valider_xml.php supposed to block everyone from performing an XML validation of an off-site document, or is it only supposed to have access control for this functionality?   > * Template Compiler/Composer PHP Code Execution  Is there public information about this already on an spip.net web site (such as a Redmine revision) or the https://sysdream.com/news/lab/ web site? Is this unrelated to the valider_xml.php script?  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  IlWWaW48n/lLS/vAtKMl =7eq2 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
