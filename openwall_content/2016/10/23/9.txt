We believe it is fine as is. The two issues could be fixed independently, although it is unlikely that anyone would do that:                          if (numcmpts == 3) {                                 jas_matrix_setv(cmpts[0], j, red);                                 jas_matrix_setv(cmpts[1], j, grn);                                 jas_matrix_setv(cmpts[2], j, blu);                         } else {                                 jas_matrix_setv(cmpts[0], j, red);  is the first "red" line; is the second.  In future cases, if you have additional analysis suggesting that two findings are best represented with one CVE ID, then please include that additional analysis in your first posting about the issue. Otherwise, we often won't know, and there could be a perception that the number of assigned IDs is inconsistent. Here, neither nor explicitly says that "two NULL pointer dereference" ought to have one CVE ID.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =z2oX -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
