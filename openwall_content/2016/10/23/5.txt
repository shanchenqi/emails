Now for completeness I posted the stacktrace of both locations in bmp_dec.c  but I guess that the root cause remains the same.  Do you need to reject one of these two or it is fine as is?   --  Agostino Sarubbo Gentoo Linux Developer  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
