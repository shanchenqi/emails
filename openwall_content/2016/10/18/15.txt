They can be used to bypass disable_functions, a security feature, in PHP. IMO they should be assigned CVEs so that they can be tacked and back-ported if desired.  I've came across php distros where these would have been patched, but didn't because CVE was not assigned and the maintainers were not aware that it was a security issue.
