We're not sure whether that affects anything outside of the CURLFile implementation. However, discusses other concerns such as "The similar bug can be also triggered via Exception::__toString with DateInterval::__wakeup" and "The problem is that every __wakeup that modifies any property would produce the same problem."  There seems to be a related code change between and that arranges for additional calls to zend_unset_property:     So, some of the options include:  1. is a complete security patch that fixes everything discussed in including the "other concerns" mentioned above.  2. fixes only the CURLFile implementation. The "other concerns" mentioned above are vulnerabilities that still exist in  3. The combination of and the above Zend/zend_exceptions.c diff is a complete security patch that fixes everything discussed in including the "other concerns" mentioned above. There only needs to be one CVE ID associated with this complete security patch.  4. The combination of and the above Zend/zend_exceptions.c diff is a complete security patch that fixes everything discussed in including the "other concerns" mentioned above. There should be one CVE ID for the security fix to the CURLFile implementation, and a separate CVE ID for the security fix found in Zend/zend_exceptions.c.  Which of the above (1 through 4) is correct and/or preferred?  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  5haHYZHlQuvZEF8ZtfhR =o6SF -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
