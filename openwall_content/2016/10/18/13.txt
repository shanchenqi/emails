As such it was left up to all the IKE implementations themselves to determine what to do with respect to retransmits.  I think it's safe to say an amplification of or more qualifies as a problem, I'm not sure what the exact amplification ratio to qualify for a CVE is (1:3, 1:7?) but I think or more should definitely qualify.  Thus a lot of other IKE implementations will be needing CVEs for this class of problem (as well as other protocols).  -- Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
