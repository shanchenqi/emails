A crafted image, through a fuzz testing, causes the memory allocation to fail.  This is the first case where my ASan symbolyzer didnât start up correctly. Iâm  reporting only what it prints at the end (not useful at all but demostrates a  bit that the issue exist)  # potrace $FILE potrace: warning: 2.hangs: premature end of file AddressSanitizer failed to allocate  bytes of LargeMmapAllocator (error code: 12) CHECK failed: /var/tmp/portage/sys- "((0 && "unable to mmap")) !=  (0)" (0x0, 0x0)  Affected version:  Fixed version: N/A  Commit fix: N/A  Credit: This bug was discovered by Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo.  CVE: N/A  Timeline: bug discovered bug reported privately to upstream blog post about the issue  Note: This bug was found with American Fuzzy Lop.
