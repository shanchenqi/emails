A crafted file causes a NULL pointer access.  This issue was discovered the past year, but I didnât make the report and I  didnât follow the state because of a lack of time. Since I saw that the issue does not happen anymore on the git head, I  asked to a libav developer (Luca Barbato) about. He said that the commit  make the issue not  anymore reachable through the provided testcase, but the issue is still  here (maybe another round of fuzzing will re-discover it on master)  The complete ASan output:  # avconv -i $FILE -f null - ASAN:SIGSEGV =============================================== ================== AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address  (pc bp sp  T0)     #0 in get_vlc2 /var/tmp/portage/media-     #1 in mpeg4_decode_sprite_trajectory  /var/tmp/portage/media-     #2 in decode_vop_header /var/tmp/portage/media-     #3 in ff_mpeg4_decode_picture_header  /var/tmp/portage/media-     #4 in mpeg4_decode_header /var/tmp/portage/media-     #5 in mpeg4video_parse /var/tmp/portage/media-     #6 in av_parser_parse2 /var/tmp/portage/media-     #7 in parse_packet /var/tmp/portage/media-     #8 in read_frame_internal /var/tmp/portage/media-     #9 in avformat_find_stream_info  /var/tmp/portage/media-     #10 in open_input_file /var/tmp/portage/media-     #11 in open_files /var/tmp/portage/media-     #12 in avconv_parse_options /var/tmp/portage/media-     #13 in main /var/tmp/portage/media-     #14 in __libc_start_main /var/tmp/portage/sys-     #15 in _start  AddressSanitizer can not provide additional info.
