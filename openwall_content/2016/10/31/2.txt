Sorry to bikeshed, but I think this isn't a kernel-hardening topic at all, so the thread should continue on oss-security only, please.  Florian, if there's a reason why you think it's kernel-hardening related, please let me know.  To me, it looks like userspace hardening that is not even kernel-assisted (at least not directly in this place, even though the kernel may have helped provide the random numbers).  If your cross-posting was to reach more of the right people, then you have already done so, and they can join oss-security now. ;-)  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
