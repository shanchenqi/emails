Use for this issue in the openssl gem for Ruby. (Note that https://github.com/ruby/openssl/blob/master/History.md describes this as "openssl gem, formerly a standard library of Ruby, ext/openssl.") The same CVE ID applies to the effects of this vulnerability on the encryptor gem and the attr_encrypted gem.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  LkjwXsTybnRdUMr+IAVC =FWLM -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
