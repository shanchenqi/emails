The REPL server is started by the ‘--listen’ command-line option or equivalent API.  Christopher Allan Webber reported that the REPL server is vulnerable to the HTTP inter-protocol attack as described at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-protocol_exploitation>, notably the HTML form protocol attack described at <https://www.jochentopf.com/hfpa/hfpa.pdf>.  This constitutes a remote code execution vulnerability for developers running a REPL server that listens on a loopback device or private network.  Applications that do not run a REPL server, as is usually the case, are unaffected.  Developers can work around this vulnerability by binding the REPL server to a Unix-domain socket, for instance by running:    guile --listen=/some/file  A modification to the REPL server that detects attempts to exploit this vulnerability is available upstream and will be part of to be released shortly.
