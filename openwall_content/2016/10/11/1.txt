During that time window, in a multithreaded application, other threads could end up creating files with insecure permissions.  For example, ‘mkdir’ without the optional ‘mode’ argument would create directories as  This can be worked around by always passing the optional ‘mode’ argument to Guile’s ‘mkdir’ procedure.  This will be fixed in to be released shortly.  Upstream bug report: Patch:  Ludo’.
