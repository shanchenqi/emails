Here, we will assign the ID to the broadest possible interpretation of the issue, which perhaps can be restated as "Tor internal functions were entitled to expect that buf_t data had NUL termination, but the implementation of or/buffers.c did not ensure that NUL termination was present."  Use  With this CVE, any related "we should still fix them as they occur" patches can most likely be treated as defense-in-depth changes, and won't require separate CVE IDs.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  RTr0TaPl+xvXHMUq+mxr =yC51 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
