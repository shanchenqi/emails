If the caller passes to regcomp a regular expression whose internal representation requires a large number of states and/or a large number of tags, too little space will be allocated during regexec, resulting in out-of-bound memory writes.  An attacker who controls the regular expression and/or the string being searched can potentially exploit these writes to achieve controlled heap corruption.  All versions of the TRE library and musl libc are affected. The attached patch fixes the issue in musl and should be easy to adapt for use with original TRE. musl git master is fixed as of commit  Rich  View attachment of type "text/plain" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
