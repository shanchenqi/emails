Use for this entire report. We do not see a sensible way in which the issue of an incorrect data type could be separated from the issue of unchecked multiplication.   > -    buf = xmalloc((unsigned)total_bytes); > +    buf = calloc(total_bytes, 1);  If this is a security fix, it would need a separate CVE ID.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =M+Ab -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
