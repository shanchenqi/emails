In the case of this IKEv1 issue it sounds like yes  and my favorite "should this get a CVE test" question:  3) can it be fixed in a way that still lets the service/clients work?  If it can be fixed in a way that leaves the service/clients working ok then chances are the old behavior is not something we want to live with anymore and we need to get rid of it.   > > - -- > CVE Assignment Team > M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA > [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at >   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] > -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- > Version: GnuPG v1 > > > > > > > > > > > > > VMx2oAIYBoExovJrb2pG > =xNIJ > -----END PGP SIGNATURE----- >    --   -- Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
