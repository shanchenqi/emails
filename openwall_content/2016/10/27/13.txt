It's intended to have no side effects, but your mileage may vary.   This will use /proc/self/mem or ptrace automatically, and it's intended to be portable to a wide range of kernels.  It's an improved version of the test case I originally sent out to distros (oops!).  --Andy  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
