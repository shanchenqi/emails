Here are the summaries  KMail: HTML injection in plain text viewer KMail: JavaScript access to local and remote URLs KMail: JavaScript execution in HTML Mails  Fixes for them are already in our various of our repos, I can link to them if  you need it, but i didn't since there's many of them (fixing spans through  various repos and commits) and didn't seem like it added much.  Thanks,   Albert  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
