We have tons of CVE requests here all the time, therefore "CVE Request" is not meaningful.  I'm not the maintainer of this mailing list, but I'm sure everyone agrees that something mentioning the name of the affected product and a short indication of what kind of bug it is would be apprechiated.  --  Hanno Bรถck https://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
