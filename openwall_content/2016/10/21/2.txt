I thought I requested membership in the past, but after double-checking I definitely did not. Shoot. DirtyCOW reminded me to actually get this set up. Is anything else needed from me?  Thanks.  -Alex  [1]: https://coreos.com/  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
