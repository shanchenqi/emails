Assuming they can handle embargoed issues (do you have private bug tracking/code repos/CI/whatever else you need to ship an update?) I would have no objections to them joining the Linux distros list. Can you confirm you have infrastructure to handle embargoed issues? If yes I guess it's up to Solar to add you.
