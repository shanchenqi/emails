The NSS announcement     mentions one:    bug NSS has been changed to use the PR_GetEnvSecure     function that was made available in NSPR  The story behind this is that NSS uses environment variables to configure lots of things, some of which refer to file system locations.  Others can be degrade the operation of NSS in various ways, forcing compatibility modes and so on.  Previously, these environment variables were not ignored SUID binaries.  NSPR and NSS introduce a new API, PR_GetEnVSecure, to address this.  It's a very thin wrapper around glibc's secure_getenv and similar functions on other systems.  Both NSPR and NSS need to be upgraded to address this; even if you run s/PR_GetEnvSecure/secure_getenv/ on the NSS sources, some unprotected environment variable lookups remain in NSPR.
