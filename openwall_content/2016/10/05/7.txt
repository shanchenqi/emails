In general, the security properties of -dSAFER are not well tested and it's probably not wise to rely on it. The issues below were found just by browsing the commands available, I haven't tried fuzzing it.  These are all possible to exploit via PDF or PS (or the various similar formats, like XPS).  If you're using ImageMagick, I would recommend disabling the PS, EPS, PDF and XPS coders in policy.xml. Applications like gimp, evince, claws, and most other applications that generate thumbnails of PDF/PS documents should probably not do so without a prompt (NOTE: A lot of packages do this https://codesearch.debian.net/search?q=-dSAFER+&perpkg=1 )  bug: various userparams allow %pipe% in paths, allowing remote shell command execution. id: repro: patch: cve: please assign  bug: .libfile doesn't check PermitFileReading array, allowing remote file disclosure. id: repro: patch: cve: please assign  bug: reference leak in .setdevice allows use-after-free and remote code execution id: repro: patch: cve: please assign  bug: type confusion in .initialize_dsc_parser allows remote code execution id: repro: patch: cve: please assign  There are a few other minor issues and leaks, but these are the important ones if you're not going to disable using gs. Please also check that you're shipping the patch for  Tavis.
