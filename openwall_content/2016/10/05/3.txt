They said that they attempted to fix this generic issue in Bundler 1.7 (see and they were able to fix most of the issues.  However, there are some edge cases, which I think Steve is referring to. Specifically, see Additionally, see also (failing spec that shows the issue) and (PR where the issue was fixed, but only on Bundler 2.x branch).  The team was never able to remove all possibilities of namespace collisions while keeping the existing lockfile format, which is why the fix was only on Bundler 2.x.  ~reed  On Tue, Oct 4, at AM, <cve-assign@...re.org> wrote:  > -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- > Hash: > > > I'd like to request a CVE to track a security vulnerability found in > > Bundler (bundler.io <http://bundler.io/>).
