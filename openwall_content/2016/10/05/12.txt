There is only one open-sourced Postscript interpreter (Ghostscript)  that I am aware of.  There are perhaps two open-sourced PDF interpreters available  (Ghostscript and derivatives of 'xpdf' like 'poppler').  ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick are depending on Ghostscript.  Since Postscript is a format commonly sent to printers, many programs  produce it, and thus it is used as an intermediate format.  The  typical use case is for ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick to automatically  run an external utility which converts from the format being read into  Postscript, then Ghostscript is used to convert it to a raster format  (e.g. PNM), and then the raster format is read by  ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick before being output to the final format.  Disabling Ghostscript or requiring user input to proceed will cause a  lot of breakage.
