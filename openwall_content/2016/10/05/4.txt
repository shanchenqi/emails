Yes, indeed. This patch also introduced a regression in the processing of some images.

Do you specifically know of a distribution that still has that patch? If I remember the context correctly, the use of comp0size could then lead to a heap buffer overflow later on. Was that what you noticed?  In any case, the patch should indeed better be replaced by the one provided upstream (cf. the Debian bug report).
