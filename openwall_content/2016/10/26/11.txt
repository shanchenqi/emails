The VFIO_DEVICE_SET_IRQS ioctl for vfio PCI devices has a state machine confusion bug where specifying VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_NONE along with another bit in VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_TYPE_MASK in hdr.flags allows integer overflow checks to be skipped for hdr.start/hdr.count. This might allow memory corruption later in vfio_pci_set_msi_trigger() with user access to an appropriate vfio device file, but it seems difficult to usefully exploit in practice.
