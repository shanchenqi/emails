In a build with QuantumDepth=8 (the default), there is no check     that the provided colormap is not larger than entries,     resulting in potential heap overflow.  This problem does not occur     with larger QuantumDepth values.  2. The assertion:      ReferenceBlob: Assertion `blob != (BlobInfo *) NULL' failed.      is thrown (causing a crash) for some files due to a logic error     which leads to passing a NULL pointer where a NULL pointer is not     allowed.  These issues were discovered using American Fuzzy Lop by fuzzing with the corpus by Moshe Kaplan discovered on Github at https://github.com/moshekaplan/FuzzGraphicsMagick.  A patch resolving the two above issues is attached.
