Use  This is an issue that had extensive debate on oss-security, e.g., the and posts. Also, only has an "enhancement" label and not a "bug" label. doesn't directly suggest that the vendor interpreted this as a bug fix. The vendor's original goal may have been to support the use case in which people deploying IRC client or server code simply do not want to bother arranging for any type of verifiable server certificate (either by using a CA or self signing), these people are not concerned that a man-in-the-middle attacker may intentionally set up something to read or modify their traffic, and these people are only concerned with already-existing observation of over-the-wire cleartext. For example, client users may have connected via https only because they don't want their IRC messages to trigger IDS rules on their own local networks, and therefore automatically send chat snippets to their local network administrators.  However, XChat and HexChat are general-purpose IRC clients that, based on their documentation, would appear suitable for any IRC client user to connect to any SSL IRC server. They didn't advertise that the SSL behavior was intended only for a prefer-not-to-accidentally-hit-an-IDS-rule use case. In creating a patch, the vendor never stated that the old behavior was once the desired behavior. So, even with the "enhancement" label, this issue must be interpreted as a vulnerability and must have a CVE ID.  For affected products, also note the mention of XChat-GNOME in the post.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =0Fpa -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
