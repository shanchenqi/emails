This script generates the CA certificate that Pulp uses to sign client certificates during the /login call. The private key was created in a world-readable folder in /tmp, and was then moved to its final destination where a chmod operation would protect it. This created a brief window where a local attacker could read the CA key before it was put into use.  This script is run during the installation of Pulp by the RPM post script, and can also be run by users any time they wish to regenerate the CA certificate.  The fix was a single line adjustment that sets the mode on the folder in /tmp to be instead of  https://github.com/pulp/pulp/commit/  Users are encouraged to upgrade to the release, and then re- run the pulp-gen-ca-certificate script to generate a new CA. It is advised to restart all Pulp processes (and httpd) after the new CA is in place. After this is done, any existing client certificates will be invalidated, so users will need to use pulp-admin login to generate new credentials.  Users who do not use Pulp's client certificate authentication system are not affected.  Thanks to Adam MariĹĄ for advising the Pulp team through the disclosure process, and to Sean Myers for a speedy code review and for performing the release process.  --  Randy Barlow irc:   bowlofeggs  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
