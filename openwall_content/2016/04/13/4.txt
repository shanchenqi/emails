As far as we can tell, the available information is:    - the last release was on    - the vulnerable code was not in that release    - the vulnerable code was added in         on    - the vulnerable code was fixed in         on    - SUSE Bug mentions the existence of home:mgorse:branches:hardware but     doesn't state that this was distributed to any SUSE customers    - https://github.com/brltty/brltty/blob/master/README doesn't seem to     have any suggestion that building the latest code from the master     branch was ever recommended for an end user  We can assign a CVE ID if there's an assertion that it's reasonable to expect that someone was affected by this vulnerability. Otherwise, we feel it could be thought of as one of the millions of cases where potentially unfinished code is added to a master branch of something, with the expectation that it could be reviewed/revised at some point before it is released.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  dYBecJWP9YFfamGXYADJ =F6zB -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
