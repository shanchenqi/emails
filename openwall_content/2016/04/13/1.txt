A flaw was found in the linux kernel which could cause a kernel panic when restoring machine specific registers on ppc platform.  Incorrect transactional memory state registers could inadvertently change the call path on return from userspace and cause the kernel to enter an unknown state in the transactional memory handling code and panic in a BUG_ON() defensively.  QMEU guests can also modify the same machine specific register values via set_one_reg and guests may invoke the same unknown state and callpath.  Since the fix is in the same location I would argue that this is the same flaw.  This only both big endian and little endian ppc platforms, it does not affect non powerpc platforms.
