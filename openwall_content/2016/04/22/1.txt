This issue has been reported to the vendor several times, who has refused to fix it in the community edition unless an enterprise license is purchased.  I've created a Github issue ( for someone in the community to submit a patch.   Could a CVE ID please be assigned to this issue.   Thanks,  Brendan Scarvell   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
