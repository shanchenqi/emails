And yes, it's too many options to remember, unfortunately.  Safe(r) use of less was previously discussed here:   To view untrusted text files, use "less -nU".  Instead of "tail -f", use "less -nUEX +F".  Setting up aliases may help.  This assumes that your distro didn't setup a script in LESSOPEN that would do something dangerous for the given filename/suffix.
