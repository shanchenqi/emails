We realize that they aren't yet on the pages.   The upstream vendor did not send a request to MITRE for 12 through 18. We will process those soon.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  VpuTfFjKSt1zsCdfLCA3 =g9RN -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
