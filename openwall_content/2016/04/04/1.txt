If you'd like, we can let you know about future releases? Or if not. please feel free to ignore this note. :-)  Thanks, David.  <cve-assign@...re.org>:  > -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- > Hash: > > > Prepopulate - Access Bypass - > > > > >> The Prepopulate module does not adequately prevent a user from > >> overwriting arbitrary parts of $_REQUEST.
