On Windows, Go loads system DLLs by name with LoadLibrary, making it vulnerable to DLL preloading attacks. Notably, if a user launched a Go executable from their Downloads folder and malicious DLLs were in their Downloads folder. This is being address in the following CL:  2. Go has an infinite loop in several big integer routines that makes Go programs vulnerable to remote denial of service attacks.  Programs using HTTPS client authentication or the Go ssh server libraries are both exposed to this vulnerability. This is being addressed in the following CL:  We will release two new versions - Go and - both of which will address these two issues.
