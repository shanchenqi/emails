We currently have an upstream bug report [2] that is non-public at the moment and patches are under review by the reporter.   1) XSS in GET parameter in ipinfo.cgi  A non-persistent XSS in GET param is available in the ipinfo.cgi. The injection can be URLencoded with certain browsers or blocked with Anti-XSS engine.  This XSS works on IE and affect IPFire version <= Core Update 99 for the moment.   File /srv/web/ipfire/cgi-bin/ipinfo.cgi line 87 : 'left', $addr . ' (' . $hostname . ') : '.$whoisname);    2) Remote command execution in proxy.cgi  Remote Command Execution in the proxy.cgi file. This file is protected from CSRF execution. Affected version <= Core Update 99 for the moment.  File /srv/web/ipfire/cgi-bin/proxy.cgi line :     system("/usr/sbin/htpasswd -b $userdb $str_user $str_pass");  The $str_pass isn't sanitized before execution in command line. It's possible to change the "NCSA_PASS" and "NCSA_PASS_CONFIRM" post data with arbitrary data.
