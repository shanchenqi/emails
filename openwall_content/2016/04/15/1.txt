It was raised to my attention that a security issues that was resolved in  Pulp 3 years ago should have had a CVE assigned to it:   To summarize, all Pulp users used the same internal CA key and cert for  versions of Pulp < This CA is used to generate a client certificate  during the /login API call, and is trusted by httpd to authenticate users.  Though the issue is now long resolved, we would like a CVE number  assigned to it for reference. Thanks!
