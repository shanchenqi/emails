Use for the remaining SVG XSS issues that were not fixed (i.e., the SVG XSS issues that remain present in versions and 1.2-rc), as described in the comment:     thomascube commented on Jan 6,     Good start! Removing script nodes, however, is just the beginning.    XSS code can also be in node attributes like onclick, onmouseover,    href="javascript:, etc. or even in CSS url() as we learned with    HTML messages.     So traversing the entire DOM is probably necessary to provide    protection that goes beyond the one example we received.   > Protect download urls against CSRF using unique request tokens > > >  Use This is not a typical type of impact associated with CSRF; however, it is still probably best to categorize this as a CSRF issue, not an SSRF issue.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  CnimPVkwnLWULwjvomSM =bl7U -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
