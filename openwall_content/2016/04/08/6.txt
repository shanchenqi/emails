The vulnerability exist in function cvt_by_strip (also exist in cvt_by_tile ) without checking the buffer allocate result. An attacker may control the write address and/or value to result in denial-of-service or command execution.     gdb tiff2rgba  (gdb) r -b sample/test.tif 1.tif  Starting program: /usr/local/bin/tiff2rgba -b sample/test.tif 1.tif TIFFFetchNormalTag: Warning, ASCII value for tag "DocumentName" contains null byte in value; value incorrectly truncated during reading due to implementation limitations.
