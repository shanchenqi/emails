Some of these issues are originated in librsvg, some in libcairo and others (libpixman maybe). Some relevant technical details are available here:   As a result of this, just browsing svg files using the open dialog of Firefox/Chromium can lead to unexpected or undefined behavior. Other applications using librsvg are likely affected.  Regards, Gus.
