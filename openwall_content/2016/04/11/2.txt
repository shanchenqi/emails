We feel that the former is the best choice here. https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp/blob/master/Readme.txt says "The following compilers are supported for this release ... GCC 3.3 - 5.2." https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp/blob/master/GNUmakefile mentions the possibility of gcc -O3:    # Aligned access required at -O3 for GCC   ...   ifeq ($(findstring -O3,$(CXXFLAGS)),-O3  mentions "Debian compiles Crypto++ with the following flags: -Wdate-time -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -g -O2 ...."  The gcc man page mentions:    -O3 Optimize yet more.  -O3 turns on all optimizations specified by -O2  Thus, roughly speaking, it seems that all of Crypto++ had an expectation of working with any recent version of gcc, even if (for example) -O2 or -O3 is used. The "code to avoid timing attacks" doesn't meet this expectation, and thus it's a vulnerability in Crypto++. (It is not a vulnerability in the packaging within Debian or any other distribution, and it is not a vulnerability in gcc.)  Use for this Crypto++ vulnerability.  (As a side note, Crypto++ is packaged for Fedora in the cryptopp package, e.g., see the http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/cryptopp.git/tree/cryptopp.spec page.)  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =ztqN -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
