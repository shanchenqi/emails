Some of these loops may in addition increase heap or stack usage, leading to more issues.  These issues were found by Pascal Cuoq and Miod Vallat using american fuzzy lop. They are fixed in libtasn1 version 4.8.  Proof of concept, using the test files distributed in :  $ asn1Decoding -v asn1Decoding (libtasn1) 4.7 âŚ $ asn1Decoding tests/pkix.asn PKIX1.Certificate Warning: VisibleString is a built-in ASN.1 type.
