However, if the numbers of tiles is 0, loadImage() will still read tile data by calling readContigTilesIntoBuffer() from the image, regardless of the numbers. In that case, loadImage() will allocate 3 bytes  heap to store a tile data, heap overflow occurs if a tile data beyond 3 bytes, and the coverd memory could be controled. It will cause denial-of-service or may command excution when freeing  the coverd heap memory..   Source info  ============    readunit = TILE;    tlsize = TIFFTileSize(in);    ntiles = TIFFNumberOfTiles(in);    TIFFGetField(in, TIFFTAG_TILEWIDTH, &tw);    TIFFGetField(in, TIFFTAG_TILELENGTH, &tl);     tile_rowsize  = TIFFTileRowSize(in);       buffsize = tlsize * ntiles; … …       if (!read_buff)              read_buff = (unsigned char *)_TIFFmalloc(buffsize+3); … …       if (!(readContigTilesIntoBuffer(in, read_buff, length, width, tw, tl, spp, bps)))       {              TIFFError("loadImage", "Unable to read contiguous tiles into buffer");              return (-1);       }    Debug info  ============ gdb  --args  tiffcrop  _TIFFfree.tif  src1.tif tmpout.tif …… (gdb) b (gdb) c  Breakpoint 1, TIFFFetchNormalTag recover=recover@...ry=1) at                                                                           (gdb) n                                                                 if (o==NULL) (gdb) p o $9 = (uint8 *) "" (gdb)b (gdb) c Continuing.
