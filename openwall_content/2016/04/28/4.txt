Other versions can be vulnerable too. They affect the following functions:  * rsvg_cairo_pop_discrete_layer - rsvg_cairo_pop_render_stack - rsvg_cairo_generate_mask: reproducible using circular-1.svg * _rsvg_css_normalize_font_size: reproducible using circular-2.svg  Both reproducers are attached in a tar.gz to avoid a crash in my own browser.  Fortunately, these issues are solved in the last git revision of librsvg2.  Regards, Gustavo.
