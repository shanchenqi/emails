Heap corruption in tar/zip/phar parser  2. Uninitialized pointer in phar_make_dirstream()  3. Multiple Heap Overflow due to integer overflows | xml/filter_url/addcslashes   Those 2nd, 3rd may let attackers with crafted PHAR file could potentially remote code execute without specific PHP script.  Could we assign CVE for these ? :)   References: http://php.net/ChangeLog-7.php http://php.net/ChangeLog-5.php    Thank you && Regards. Luat.
