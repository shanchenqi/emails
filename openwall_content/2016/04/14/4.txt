Hi List,  This morning I realized a flaw in my testing methodology, I used php5-cgi on the command line setting environment variables to pass the XSS payload to the vulnerable php code.  What I failed to realize is that if the plugin code was setting a content-header this would be missed when I used phantomJS to render the html output and execute any JS I had injected.  The result is only 25 of the plugins are exploitable.  The other 14 aren't XSSable because they set the content header  to something the browser doesn't render.  Here is a list of the remaining plugins.  I'm sorry for my mistake.
