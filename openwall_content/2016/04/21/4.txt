DLL hijacking.  Before proceeding with CVE ID assignment, we have some questions. We understand from your many reports of issues in other products that there is a realistic attack scenario in which a Trojan horse uxtheme.dll might already be present in the user's Downloads directory before the user downloads/launches a GnuPG installer file (such as or from the https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/binary web site).  1. Is this a vulnerability in code that was developed specifically for GnuPG, or is it a vulnerability in a third-party product that was used to create the GnuPG executable installer files?  2. You refer to "the installers application directory" - this is terminology that you have used in other reports about other products. Can you confirm that this commonly means a Downloads directory or %TEMP% -- and does not mean the %PROGRAMFILES%\GNU\GnuPG directory? In other words, "installers application directory" seems potentially ambiguous because %PROGRAMFILES%\GNU\GnuPG is the default application directory that is created by the installer.  3. Would it be better to consider this a vulnerability in any web browser, or other HTTP client, that defaults to saving all downloaded executable files and DLL files into a single Downloads directory? At least on Windows, if the user has chosen to download a .exe file, perhaps the default behavior should make that .exe file the only file in a directory, and that directory should be created in a safe location and with safe permissions.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  z+gfciVkcWm70hXJvrVE =C6gY -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
