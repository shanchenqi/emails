Yes, there was a mail delivery problem from oss-security on April 8, resolved on April 9.  Several of the messages were initially queued up, and when the problem was resolved and they were finally attempted to be delivered, they could not be delivered to some of you, as well as to some of the third-party archives, presumably because of those servers' use of greylisting (or any other intermittent errors).  Crucially, there was not a second delivery attempt because of those messages' age in the queue.  Indeed, this is incompatible with greylisting, and in hindsight we should have temporarily increased the allowable queue age before resolving the initial problem.  The official archive has the full set of messages posted on April 8:   Specifically, the multiple notifications about different libtiff vulnerabilities were affected, so if libtiff is relevant to you please review the above archive page.
