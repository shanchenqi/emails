'-' . $current_time . '-' . ITSEC_Lib::get_random( mt_rand( 5, 10 ) );  In core/class-itsec-logger.php, line  :          $itsec_globals['settings']['log_info'] = substr( sanitize_title( get_bloginfo( 'name' ) ), 0, 20 ) . '-' . ITSEC_Lib::get_random( mt_rand( 0, 10 ) );   In core/class-itsec-lib.php, function get_random, line          public static function get_random( $length, $base32 = false, $special_chars = false ) {                  if ( true === $base32 ) {                          $string =                  } else {                          $string =                          if ( true === $special_chars ) {                                  $string .= '_)(*&^%$#@!~`:;<>,.?/{}[]|';                          }                  }                  return substr( str_shuffle( $string ), mt_rand( 0, strlen( $string ) - $length ), $length );          }   The str_shuffle should *never* be used for generating secure strings as it uses the PHP rand() function and just shuffles the characters' position.  -------- Solution --------  Make sure to generate non-predictable strings, using cryptographically secure generators.  Update iThemes Security to version >=  Affected versions =================  * iThemes Security <=  Timeline (dd/mm/yyyy) =====================  * : Initial contact with iThemes. * : iThemes confirms the vulnerabilities. * : iThemes publishes a new version of iThemes Security that fixes the vulnerabilities.
