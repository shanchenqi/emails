As somebody else noted, it should be s/doesn't interpret/neutralizes/ or  something. But that doesn't mean you should feel safe if you don't use  -r.  For example, when git automatically spawns a pager, it puts R in the  LESS environment variable. (That would be fine if git escaped  before passing them to the pager, but it doesn't. Oddly, it does seem to  escape other control characters.) Now, -R is less convenient than -r for  hiding malicious code, but you could still set foreground and background  to black in hope that the victim's terminal background is also black.  But even without -r or -R, one can use backspace characters to hide evil  payload:  | $ less -FX hello.c | #include <stdio.h> | #include <stdlib.h> | | int main(int argc, char **argv) | { |         /* Copyright Jakub Wilk */ |         printf("Hello world!\n"); |         return 0; | } | | $ gcc -Wall hello.c -o hello && ./hello |  ________ | < ^H^H^H > |  -------- |         \   ^__^ |          \  (oo)\_______ |             (__)\       )\/\ |                 ||----w | |                 ||     ||  --  Jakub Wilk  View attachment "hello.c" of type "text/x-csrc" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
