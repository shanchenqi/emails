By default, when using the "database backup on filesystem" feature, iThemes Security saves the backup files in a world-readable directory :  wp-content/uploads/ithemes-security/backups  The .htaccess file is generated during the plugin initial setup/update, only if the wp-content/uploads/ithemes-security/backups exists (or wp-content/uploads/ithemes-security/logs). Note that it does *NOT* exists by default.  When running a backup, the ITSEC_Backup class creates the directory but *without* any .htaccess file inside. The same thing happens with log saving.  If the webserver has directory listing enabled, then anybody can download the complete database backup or view the log files.   **Access Vector**: remote  **Security Risk**: high  **Vulnerability**:  **CVSS Base Score**: 7.5  --------------- Vulnerable code ---------------  The vulnerable code is located in core/modules/backup/class-itsec-backup.php, line :      if ( ! is_dir( $itsec_globals['ithemes_backup_dir'] ) ) {         @mkdir( trailingslashit( $itsec_globals['ithemes_dir'] ) . 'backups' );     }  And in core/class-itsec-logger.php, line 31 :      //Make sure the logs directory was created     if ( ! is_dir( $itsec_globals['ithemes_log_dir'] ) ) {             @mkdir( trailingslashit( $itsec_globals['ithemes_dir'] ) . 'logs' );     }  The application creates the backup/log directory, but *not* the .htaccess/index file inside.  -------- Solution --------  Add a default index file file inside the backup folder when creating the directory or store the backups outside of the web root.  Update iThemes Security to version >=  Timeline (dd/mm/yyyy) =====================  * : Initial contact with iThemes. * : iThemes confirms the vulnerabilities. * : iThemes publishes a new version of iThemes Security that fixes the vulnerabilities.
