Description: The infamous Java serialization vulnerability  Mitigation: users should upgrade to users should upgrade to (Note though that in RMI is not deactivated so you should use the recommended remediation: notsoserial)  Credit: This infamous issue was confirmed to be an issue in OFBiz by the OFBiz team, due to two external Java libraries and RMI usage.  Remediation: Apart when using RMI with version nothing is needed. But with any version, if you use  JNDI, JMX or Spring and maybe other Java classes,  please check the references (hint: use notsoserial with your own whitelist)  References: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OFBIZ/The+infamous+Java+serialize+vulnerability  ==========================================  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
