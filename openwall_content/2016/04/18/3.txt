It occurs during communication between host controller  interface(EHCI) and a respective device driver. These two communicate via a  split isochronous transfer descriptor list(siTD) and an infinite loop unfolds  if there is a closed loop in this list.  A privileges used inside guest could use this flaw to consume excessive CPU  cycles & resources on the host.  This issue is similar to but using siTD instead of iTD.
