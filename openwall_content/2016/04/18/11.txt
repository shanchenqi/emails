This CA is used by the /login API call (pulp-admin login uses this call) to generate and sign a client certificate. This client certificate is then used for subsequent API calls.  Due to this vulnerability, remote attackers are able to obtain the CA key from the Pulp git repository and use it to generate valid client certificates for any Pulp installations that use the default CA. The Pulp documentation did not emphasize the importance of replacing this CA for production deployments, so there may be users who use this common CA key in production environments.  Users are urged to replace the CA certificate and key on any Pulp installations that began their life with a version less than Upgrading alone is not sufficient, as Pulp upgrades do not replace existing CA key pairs. Versions of Pulp >= do ship a utility (pulp-gen-ca-certificate) that is capable of generating a new CA keypair for you, but it should be noted that there are some known local attacks that this script is vulnerable to as well[1][2]. The best option is to generate your own CA certificate if you are concerned about these local attacks.  Thanks to Sander Bos for notifying the Pulp team that we had neglected to acquire a CVE for this vulnerability at the time of its discovery.
