Use  (We consider this a single "to be sign-extended from 32 to 64" issue even though there are two different types of impacts. Also, the structure of the code change ("Int_val" replaced by "Long_val") is the same everywhere. We did not consider it worthwhile to sort through the possible "independently encountered" aspects as mentioned, for example, in the comment.)  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =BBAV -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
