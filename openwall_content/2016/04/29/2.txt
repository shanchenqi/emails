Comments created for "tasks" aren't having HTML characters sanitized correctly resulting in a stored XSS being executed when any user visits the page.  Activiti Explorer also has the parsing of external entities enabled and I've noticed that deployments tab is vulnerable to XXE. An attacker is able to upload malicious XML files to read arbitrary files off the server.   I've attempted to report the issue to the vendor several times, however have received no response.  Timeline: March 11  - Contacted vendor, no response March 17  - Contacted vendor, no response. March 24  - Contacted vendor, no response April 1      - Contacted vendor, no response April 15    - Contacted vendor, gave deadline for April 29th. April 29th - Still no response  Could a CVE ID please be assigned to these issues.
