We feel that this should not have a CVE ID because the removed curl and wget options had been intentional behavior. In other words, the vendor was not particularly interested in ensuring that the client was communicating with the correct web site. That required relying on third parties (maintainers of curl and wget) to maintain certificate data. Instead, the vendor was interested in whether the client was downloading the correct file. Achieving that can be independent.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =/IEH -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
