[62]            } else { [63]                    die('Direct Access to this location is not  allowed.');  As default option the easybill-module is not installed and the constant  MODULE_EASYBILL_CSV_CRON_TOKEN is not set. As long as the  easybill-module is not installed, it is possible to bypass the  restriction:  [Shoproot]/api/easybill/easybillcsv.php?token=MODULE_EASYBILL_CSV_CRON_TOKEN   [35]            if (count($_GET['orders_status']) > 0) { [36]            $_GET['orders_status'] = preg_replace("'[\r\n\s]+'", '',  $_GET['orders_status']); [37]            $orders_status = explode(',', $_GET['orders_status']); [38]            $module->from_orders_status = implode("', '",  $orders_status); [39]            }   [43]            if (isset($_GET['customers_status'])) { [44]            $_GET['customers_status'] = preg_replace("'[\r\n\s]+'",  '', $_GET['customers_status']); [45]            $customers_status = explode(',',  $_GET['customers_status']); [46]            $module->from_customers_status = implode("', '",  $customers_status); [47]            }  As you can see in lines and the GET-parameters  'orders_status' and 'customers_status' are not escaped, but formatted  (removed whitespaces, replaced commas with "', '"). They will be set as  local variables of the "$module"-object.  File: [shoproot][admin-folder]/includes/modules/system/easybillcsv.php  [63]        $export_query = xtc_db_query("SELECT DISTINCT o.orders_id [64]                                    FROM ".TABLE_ORDERS." o [65]                                    JOIN  ".TABLE_ORDERS_STATUS_HISTORY." osh [66]                                      ON o.orders_id = osh.orders_id [67]                                   WHERE (o.orders_status IN ('" .  $this->from_orders_status .

Through the ORDER BY statement (with the explicit table-references) it  is not possible to use a union-based injection. The injection cannot include whitespaces or commas.  POC [Proof of Concept]:  Will result in following query and execute the sleep-function for 5  seconds:  SELECT DISTINCT o.orders_id                                     FROM ".TABLE_ORDERS." o                                      JOIN ".TABLE_ORDERS_STATUS_HISTORY."  osh                                        ON o.orders_id = osh.orders_id                                     WHERE (o.orders_status IN                                        long comment                                       */#comment                                 ORDER BY o.orders_id  There are multiple ways to bypass the whitespace/comma-filter. A  possible way to check if the first character of the admin-hash is '$'  would be:       Timeline ----- Reporting vulnerability to vendor  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
