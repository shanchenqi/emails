A buffer overflow in the cachemgr.cgi tool reported by CESG (CESG REF: / VULNERABILITY ID: allows remote clients to perform an indirect denial of service attack on the proxy administrator. It could be used trivially to hide other activities from inspection. Or be used to perform remote code execution on systems without overflow protection.  This bug was also independently reported by Yuriy M. Kaminskiy.  The cachemgr.cgi tool is vulnerable when built from; Squid-3.x up to and including Squid-4.x up to and including and Squid-2.x all versions.  Upstream report will be at:   Patches at:         Multiple on-stack buffer overflow from incorrect bounds calculation in Squid ESI processing has been reported by CESG (CESG REF: / VULNERABILITY ID: which allows remote code execution or denial of service if depending on the OS overflow protections which are active.  Further investigation has found that when compiler optimization is applied incorrect use of assert() leads to information disclosure of stack contents to remote clients and a second buffer overflow leads to further remote code execution possibilities.  Squid-2.x are not vulnerable. Squid-3.x up to and including Squid-4.x up to and including  when built with --enable-esi and used for either CDN reverse-proxy or TLS MITM are vulnerable.  Upstream report will be at:   Patches at:         PS. Some of our mirrors may not be updated for up to 24hrs.
