Is there an important way in which this differs from "The vtun client is not installed. The attacker simply writes their own program to reconnect without sleeping and make many syslog calls"?  For example: does vtun's resource consumption belong to the root account in a common scenario, but SIGHUP is accepted from an unprivileged user? Are different unprivileged users successfully sending SIGHUP to one another's vtun client processes? Do you mean that there's a potentially common attack pattern in which a man-in-the-middle attacker intentionally blocks connections to the remote server in order to trick the victim into sending a SIGHUP, and (in some sense) this man-in-the-middle attacker is thereby able to trigger the excessive resource consumption?  Sometimes there are CVE IDs for "a client application inadvertently starts launching a network DoS attack" but this is typically only in cases where someone can send forged packets to the client application in order to start the attack.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =huSO -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
