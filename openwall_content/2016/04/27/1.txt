A flaw was discovered in the linux kernel tty subsystem which allows for disclosure of uncontrolled memory location and possible kernel panic. The information leak is caused by a race condition when attempting to set and read the tty line discipline.  An attacker can use the TIOCSETD (via tty_set_ldisc ) to switch to a new line discipline, a concurrent call to with a TIOCGETD ioctl performs a read on a given tty may be able to access memory previously  allocated.  Up to 4 bytes may leaked to userspace when querying the line discipline.
