In uart_write() function from hw/char/cadence_uart.c, the ‘offset’ isn’t checked and after it is divided by 4 and used to index the ‘r’ array, it will cause an out-of-bands memory write. The value can be controlled by guest and can cause the qemu crash or code execution on host.  The patch is here:  Thanks,  Li Qiang of the Cloud Security Team, Qihoo Inc.
