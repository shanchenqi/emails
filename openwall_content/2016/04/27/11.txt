To my knowledge, none of the issues recently posted on this list have  been addressed yet in libtiff.  It is always our priority to fix issues occuring in libtiff itself  before addressing issues in the libtiff utilities.  Some of the  libtiff maintainers care about only a few of the utilities.  We are  all volunteers and available time is limited.  It is my intention to spend time addressing the libtiff utility issues  (some of which might be due to issues in core libtiff) once I have  addressed the remaining CVEs in GraphicsMagick.  Issues appearing to  be due to problems in libtiff itself will get attention first.  Well-formulated source patches are welcomed for the issues.
