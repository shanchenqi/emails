Any security issues that you post to oss-security should be either already public or to be made public by your posting." Because you apparently are publishing both the research methodology (i.e., AddressSanitizer) and the types of findings, this is close to a public disclosure but may be outside the spirit of the list. (We definitely would not have responded here if the one fully described case, segv.ics.bug, had been omitted.)  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =O5An -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
