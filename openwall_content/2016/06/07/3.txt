The controller uses 16-byte FIFO  buffer the information transfer. The OOB r/w occurs while reading/writing to  this buffer in esp_reg_read() and esp_reg_write() routines.  A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process  resulting in DoS OR potentially leverage it to execute arbitrary code with  privileges of the Qemu process on the host.  Upstream patch: ---------------    ->  Reference: ----------    ->  This issue was independently discovered and reported by Li Qiang of Inc  and Security Team at Huawei Inc.
