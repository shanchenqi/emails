This is a crash issue in the bmp2tiff command-line program, not an issue within the libtiff library. Accordingly, it only affects use of the bmp2tiff program, not other programs that a user may build with the library. If the user accesses a crafted BMP file and observes a crash in bmp2tiff, with the reported "READ" outside the bounds of a buffer, then a complete solution may be for the user to avoid accessing that specific BMP file again. As far as we can tell, this "READ of size 1" does not affect the flow of control and is not exploitable for code execution.   > #################################### > 3) heap buffer overflow in bmp2tiff > #################################### >  > Memory corruption bugs can be triggered when bmp2tiff handling maliciously crafted bmp file, it will cause the target  > application to crash. >  > PackBitsEncode.c:line 85 does not check the length of bp passed through buf.
