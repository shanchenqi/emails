Also, urrlib2 in the Subject line is a typo of urllib2.  In the first message seems slightly unsure about whether it is a vulnerability, but then the vendor confirms that it is a vulnerability:  >> I'd like to opt to begin with prohibiting newline characters >> to be present in HTTP headers. Although this issue is not a >> "hard vulnerability" such as a buffer overflow, it does translate >> to a potentially equal level of severity  >> Here's a patch addressing the potential vulnerability as reported.  Finally, explains that this is not in the general report category of "this library omits input validation that is arguably either required or expected, and therefore real-life applications might be affected if they offer an unusually large attack surface to untrusted input." Instead, it is in the category of "this library omits input validation that is obviously critical during URL parsing, and therefore there are almost certainly many affected real-life applications." (The former category often qualifies for CVE IDs, but the decision is much easier in the latter category.)
