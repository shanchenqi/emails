VERIFY_PEER only checks the cert chain is rooted in the local truststore. It does not check if the subject is valid in and of itself.  My understanding is the ssl_socket.post_connection_check(hostname) method must be called to ensure the subject is correctly verified. However, communication is allowed to remote services without verifying the subject.  I would suggest throwing an exception if VERIFY_PEER is configured and I/O is attempted without first calling post_connection_check  It would also be nice if this all happened automatically simply by passing hostname into OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket (which AFAICT only affects SNI presently, and not subject verification)  ----  Ciao, Marcus --  Marcus Meissner,SUSE LINUX GmbH; Maxfeldstrasse 5; Nuernberg; Zi. <meissner@...e.de>  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
