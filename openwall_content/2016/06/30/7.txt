If a referenced type is >> currently being demangled, the demangling is marked as not successful.  Use  As far as we can tell, there was only one vulnerability reported here. We don't understand the reference to "All vulnerabilities were found with" - this seems to imply more than one vulnerability. Also, we don't understand the parenthesized numbers such as "No demangling of untrusted binaries (2)" in the Subject line, and "Libiberty Demangler segfaults (6)" and "Fix fir in Libiberty Demangler (6)" in the references.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  dsWpgmbMAUIb6gmzPCR2 =De4P -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
