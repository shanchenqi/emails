A request that included a specially crafted request parameter could be used to execute arbitrary code or access content that would otherwise be protected by a security constraint.  Mitigation: Users should upgrade to [1],  ensure a secret cipher key is configured [2], or disable the "remember me" feature. [3]  All binaries (.jars) are available in Maven Central already.  References: [1] http://shiro.apache.org/download.html [2] http://shiro.apache.org/configuration.html#Configuration-ByteArrayValues [3] If using a shiro.ini, "remember me" can be disabled adding the following config line in the '[main]' section:   securityManager.rememberMeManager = null   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
