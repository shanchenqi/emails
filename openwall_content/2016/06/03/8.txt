It think it may need another CVE:  The call to srand(3) can reduce the security of the calling application, depending on what it is doing with srand(3)/random(3).  This behavior is recognized as a bug by Fedora, too  There are multiple related commits in Expat's Git repository.  I am happy to extract a single to-the-point patch for your version of Expat and operating system platform from that for you, if needed.
