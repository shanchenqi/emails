Comment 4 is a private comment, but there is apparently a copy of it in the public Comment 3:     This flexible behaviour is allowed because it makes parsing    space-separated lists of addresses (as C strings) easier to manage.    You advance the pointer between the address blocks and call    inet_aton. In this case getaddrinfo uses inet_aton to determine the    validity of the input string, and so considers    a valid name parameter and it is immediately converted into the    address structure for  The remaining concern is that there's a potentially important enhancement to glibc in which functionality would be added that is similar to the current inet_addr/inet_aton behavior but with rejected as an invalid address. The current behavior possibly belongs on a list of glibc oddities but, we think, not on the CVE list.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =2hPX -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
