The release missed one fix for an out of bounds read in the rar parser. Also I discovered one additional signed integer overflow issue with ubsan. Both issues are now fixed in libarchive All issues were discovered with the help of american fuzzy lop.  Out of bounds heap read in RAR parser Sample rar file  Signed integer overflow in ISO parser Sample ISO file  Also a couple of other security issues in libarchive were found by Cisco.  With the release of version I consider libarchive to be reasonably robust against fuzzing. I've tested all supported file formats and fuzzed each one with afl/asan for at least one day. Of course that doesn't mean that no security issues are left - but the easy to find ones should be wiped out.   --  Hanno Bรถck https://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
