It looks like someone had attempted to find+replace all the obvious PHP Object Injection issues (i.e. unserialize($_POST['foo'])) at some point, but they didn't look for variables directly derived from user input. (foreach ($_POST['foo'] as $bar)).  I've sent follow-up emails to the development team but was never notified of any progress towards fixing it.  The first one appears to have been fixed in the release-2.1 branch, but the other one still exists.  is fixed  is unfixed  That's all from me.
