In order to ensure full traceability, we need a CVE number assigned that we can attach to further notifications. This issue is already public, although an advisory was not sent yet.  Title: Neutron IPTables firewall anti-spoof protection bypass Reporter: Romain Aviolat (Nagravision) and           Dustin Lundquist (Blue Box Group, Inc) Products: Neutron Affects:  Description: Romain Aviolat from Nagravision and Dustin Lundquist from Blue Box Group, Inc independently reported vulnerabilities in Neutron anti-spoof protection. By forging DHCP discovery messages or non-IP traffic, such as ARP or ICMPv6, an instance may spoof IP or MAC source addresses on attached networks resulting in denial of services and/or traffic interception. Moreover when L2population isn't used, other tenants attached to a shared network are also vulnerable. Neutron setups using the IPTables firewall driver are affected.  References: (icmpv6) (mac, dhcp)  Note: The dhcp fix has been included in the release and this request probably needs more than one CVE.
