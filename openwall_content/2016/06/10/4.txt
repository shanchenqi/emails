CVE IDs are not assigned to UDP protocols solely on the basis of an observed amplification-attack risk. A CVE ID can exist if the UDP reply traffic simply cannot ever have any legitimate purpose for users of a protocol. The general case of the interaction between UDP amplification and CVE was discussed between MITRE and CERT in this may be the reason that no CVE ID is listed in the document.  We can, however, assign a CVE ID to a vendor's announcement of a required security update, such as on the https://libreswan.org/ home page:    "libreswan vulnerable to DDOS attack. Please upgrade to  Use for this issue only in the libreswan codebase.   >  > This is tracked via upstream bug:  >  We don't think that Bug tracks this "one update to libreswan IKEv1 to reduce amplification caused by retransmits" issue. Bug is about a possible functionality problem in the release, It is marked "Importance: Low enhancement."  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  8pFYiRXpWVYsrwtR+nBs =L6xn -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
