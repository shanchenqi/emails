First, several of the https://sogo.nu/bugs URLs provide an "Access Denied" response and we were wondering whether that was intentional. MITRE has no role in determining the list charter, but http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security says "List Content Guidelines ... Any security issues that you post to oss-security should be either already public or to be made public by your posting."  When required, CVE IDs can be assigned based on commits in conjunction with non-public bug reports; this potentially addresses all of the cases except for SOGo which is apparently not yet public at all.  Also, your message didn't mention whether you are making the CVE request on behalf of the Inverse team, or whether you are noting issues that are security-related from your own perspective.  Going through the list of public issues:  SOGo - is the ultimate case of the entire issue summarized by "copies the attachment (into memcached?) and then eliminates the copy in the sogod. The memcached copy stays forever/until the SOGo service is restarted"? Or is there a second implementation error? It seems that part of the issue, but not all of it, is a feature request (SOGo suggesting that SOGo should have size limits because configuring limits at the level of the web server and SMTP server disrupts the user experience.  SOGo is listed twice but the second one has in the URL. We are guessing that the second "SOGo is just a "SOGo typo. More importantly, are there two distinct code problems? Or is it a single code problem that is reachable with different attack vectors?  SOGo has two identical "Issue: lines. Was one of them supposed to be a different URL?  SOGo - we are able to assign IDs. Does "SOGo Script injection in calendar title ... Reporter: Jens Erat" mean that your own discovery was only about the calendar title, and that additional attack vectors ("contacts module" and "CSS dialogs") were follow-on discoveries by the Inverse team?  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =EtEt -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
