The vulnerability of out-of-bound writes is in PixarLogDecode() in libtiff.so without checking the buffer length, which cause the head data of next heap could be filled with any data, crash occurs when the next heap is allocated or freed. Attackers could exploit this issue to crash nautilus to result in DoS.
