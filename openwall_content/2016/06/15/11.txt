Gday,  A flaw was found in the Linux kernels keyring handling code, where in key_reject_and_link() there's an uninitialised variable that isn't set by __key_link_begin() on the destination keyring if that function fails.  If a destination keyring was supplied, then __key_link_end() is called whether or not __key_link_begin() succeeded, with the result that the edit pointers contains members which end up being freed.   These are the user controlled addresses that can exist from previous memory contents.
