Here are the additional details I promised:    The gist of it is that protocol injection can occur not only if an application sets a header based on user-supplied values, but also if the application ever tries to fetch a URL specified by an attacker (SSRF case) OR if the application ever accesses any malicious web server (redirection case).  URLs of the following form allow injection into the HTTP stream:       More details in the blog post, of course.
