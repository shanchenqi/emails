In Python zipimport module, if compress != 0, then bytes_size = data_size + 1 data_size is not sanitized, so if data_size = -1, then it overflows and becomes 0.  In that case, python allocates small heap, but after that in freed, it overflows heap. Fix info Please help assign a CVE to this vulnerability. Thank you.  --  Regards Insu Yun   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
