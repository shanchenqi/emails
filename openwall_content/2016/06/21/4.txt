In order to ensure full traceability, we need a CVE number assigned. This issue is already public.  It was recently discovered that our puppet-gerrit module configures Gerrit in a way which makes it vulnerable to a XSS attack. This stems from our configuration marking text/html as a 'safe' mimetype[1]. This configuration change was first made in May but we believe it did not begin working until Feb Using this, a user could potentially craft a review which when visited at the proper url would have access to the account information of any user visiting that url.  It is highly recommended that all downstream users of this module apply this commit[4] to protect themselves against this attack.  Thanks, Greg  1:  2:  3:  4:    --    Gregory Haynes   greg@...ghaynes.net -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  G+xXItIFLYST0JUA0EiQ =mBX/ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
