There are additional similar problems in setroubleshoot and setroubleshoot-plugins:  - setroubleshoot, affecting 'sealert --fix'.  Problem was   already fixed in version     - setroubleshoot-plugins, allow_execmod plugin.  Also   previously fixed in versoin     - setroubleshoot-plugins, allow_execstack plugin.   Similar to the previous one, only using commands.getoutput instead of   commands.getstatusoutput.     --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
