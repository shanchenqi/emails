However, they do not plan to make their security advisory public. The CVE descriptions are based only on the surface-level code-change information that is public in GitHub. For open-source software, it is relatively rare for someone to compose a detailed advisory about multiple CVEs and keep it permanently non-public, but this can happen. One of the effects of non-public advisories is that the number of CVEs may seem unrelated to the commit message.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =lITg -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
