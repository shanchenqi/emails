Yes, we confirm that. (They are unanticipated both because of thread-safety concerns, and because it's possible for an application to have an important dependency on srand being called exactly once.)   > The hash DoS vulnerability was fixed to some extend in > Expat commit > ... > The next release of Expat will not do internal calls to srand (or rand) > any more but extract and use entropy from other sources. > ... > I suppose hash initialization with (too little /) second-based > entropy still is part of the original (or the same again).  Use for the separate issue in which the original choices of entropy source and RNG did not properly address the possibility of a successful hash DoS attack. In other words, the code changes (in the next release) to fix are needed because the original fix for was insufficient. (We use separate CVE IDs when follow-on work is needed to complete the solution to the same original vulnerability finding.)  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =r9fV -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
