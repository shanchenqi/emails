The issue is triggered by a file name length of zero in an internal data structure.  This cases the code to do operations on a buffer returned by malloc(0), first a memory access, then a memory write and finally a lstat().  I've send the valgrind output and a patch to fix it to <URL: > and upstream.  I have no idea if the issue is a security issue, though.  I could not come up with a way to use the unwanted reads and writes for anything interesting. --  Happy hacking Petter Reinholdtsen    Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
