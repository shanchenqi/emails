Description : A vulnerability in smtplib allowing MITM attacker to perform a startTLS stripping attack. smtplib does not seem to raise an exception when the remote end (smtp server) is capable of negotiating starttls but fails to respond with (ok) to an explicit call of SMTP.starttls(). This may allow a malicious MITM to perform a startTLS stripping attack if the client code does not explicitly check the response code for startTLS.  Upstream patch : 3.4 branch : 2.7 branch :  Red Hat Bugzilla :  Reported by: Tin (Team Oststrom)  Kind regards,  --  Cedric Buissart, Product Security  Purkynova 99 Brno 45   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
