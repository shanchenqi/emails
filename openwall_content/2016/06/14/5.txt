An out of bounds memory read in the VerticalFilter() function can be triggered by a malformed DDS file. https://crashes.fuzzing-project.org/imagemagick-oob-heap-read-VerticalFilter.dds Sample file Git commit / fix This was fixed in versions and  Several bugs in the WPG parser could lead to a heap overflow and random invalid memory writes. These bugs only seem to appear when a memory limit is set. https://crashes.fuzzing-project.org/imagemagick-heapoverflow-SetPixelIndex.wpg Sample for heap write overflow in SetPixelIndex https://crashes.fuzzing-project.org/imagemagick-invalid-write-ScaleCharToQuantum.wpg Sample for unclear invalid write in ScaleCharToQuantum https://crashes.fuzzing-project.org/imagemagick-invalid-write-SetPixelIndex.wpg Sample for unclear invalid write in SetPixelIndex Git commit / fix 1 Git commit / fix 2 These issues were fixed in versions and  Null pointer accesses and unclear segfaults can happen in the DCM parser. Sample for null pointer access in ReadDCMImage Sample for null pointer access in ReadDCMImage (different code) Sample for unclear segfault in ReadDCMImage Git commit / fix These issues were fixed in versions and   --  Hanno Bรถck https://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
