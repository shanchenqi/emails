AMD has updated their microcode some time ago, therefore here's some more data on this bug, and code that triggers it.  On the guest system: ================================================== #include <unistd.h> #include <sys/syscall.h> #include <string.h> #include <stdint.h> #include <linux/perf_event.h>  int main (void) {   int i;   // increasing i from 2 to makes it easier  // to trigger Oops in the host kernel   for (i = 0; i < 2; i++)   {     struct perf_event_attr attr;     memset(&attr, 0, sizeof attr);     attr.type = PERF_TYPE_HARDWARE;     attr.size = sizeof attr;     attr.config = PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_MISSES;     attr.sample_period = 32;     syscall(__NR_perf_event_open, &attr, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0);   } } ==================================================  And typical crashes in the host kernel:  Stack-protector failure (stack corruption) ================================================== <0>[ Kernel panic - not syncing: stack-protector: Kernel stack is corrupted in: <0>[ <4>[ CPU: 1 PID: Comm: qemu-system-x86 Not tainted #20-Ubuntu <4>[ Hardware name: To be filled by O.E.M.
