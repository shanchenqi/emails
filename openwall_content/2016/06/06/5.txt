ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  VMIDs are a finite hardware resource, and allocated as part of domain creation.  If no free VMIDs are available when trying to create a new domain, a bug in the error path causes a NULL pointer to be used, resulting in a Data Abort and host crash.  IMPACT ======  Attempting to create too many concurrent domains causes a host crash rather than a graceful error.  A malicious device driver domain can hold references to domains, preventing its VMID being released.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen versions 4.4 and later are affected.  Older Xen versions are unaffected.  x86 systems are not affected.  Only arm systems with less-privileged device driver domains can expose this vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  There is no mitigation.  Not using driver domains reclassifies the problem, but does not fix it.  NOTE REGARDING LACK OF EMBARGO ==============================  The crash was discussed publicly on xen-devel, before it was appreciated that there was a security problem.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Aaron Cornelius of DornerWorks.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            xen-unstable, Xen 4.6.x, 4.5.x       Xen 4.4.x  $   $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =kBFB -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
