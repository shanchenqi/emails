This (from CHANGES.md) seems notable and probably deserves a CVE:  ------------- ##Side Channel Vulnerability on RSA Cipher Suites A Bleichenbacher variant attack, where certain information is leaked from the results of a RSA private key operation has been reported by a security researcher. The code has been updated to error without providing any information on the premaster contents.  > Note that other side channel attacks may still be possible as > MatrixSSL non-FIPS crypto is not always constant-time. -------------   This also: ------------- ##Access Violation on Malicious TLS Record TLS cipher suites with CBC mode in TLS 1.1 and 1.2 could have an access violation (read beyond memory) with a maliciously crafted message. -------------  This is probably the same bug as described here:  Quote ------------- OpenSSL is not alone. I found a similar problem in the MatrixSSL library, see https://github.com/matrixssl/matrixssl/blob/master/CHANGES.md. In that case, unfortunately, a bad patch of Lucky 13 lead even to a buffer overread vulnerability. -------------  --  Hanno Bรถck https://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
