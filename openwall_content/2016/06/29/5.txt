The vulnerability allows an attacker to control the size of the allocated heap-buffer while independently controlling the data to be written to the buffer with no restrictions on the size of the written data.  The bug seems to be at least superficially related to however this vulnerability seems to be a separate issue and not just a case of an insufficient fix.  The issue is fixed in CVS HEAD with the commit:  revision date:  author: erouault;  state: Exp;  lines: +9 -1;  commitid: * libtiff/tif_pixarlog.c: fix potential buffer write overrun in PixarLogDecode() on corrupted/unexpected images (reported by Mathias Svensson)   Kind regards, Mathias Svensson, Google Security Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
