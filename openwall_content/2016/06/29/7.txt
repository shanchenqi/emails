Mitigation: Applications that are using library versions older than should upgrade as soon as possible. Distributors of older versions should apply the patches from this subversion revision:   Note that the nesting limit is currently implemented as a compile-time constant in order to maintain ABI-compatibility.  In addition, a related enhancement was made to enable applications to fully disable DTD processing through the use of an environment variable. Distributors of older versions are urged to incorporate this patch to enable applications to more fully protect themselves from future issues if they do not require DTD support. This change is ABI-compatible and can be found in this subversion revision:   Credit: This issue was reported by Brandon Perry.
