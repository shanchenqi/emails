SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: SEGV ??:0 icalproperty_new_clone    I am posting this to Full Disclosure/OSS instead of reporting it because I have opened a handful of libical bugs in the Mozilla bug tracker, alerted security@...illa.org <mailto:security@...illa.org>, and worked to show how and where to reproduce the bugs in Thunderbird, but Mozilla hasnât shown any care at all about the bugs. Perhaps if I give a sample to the community of the bugs in the bug reports, Mozilla will take the bug reports more seriously. This bug attached had not been reported yet.  While list members likely will not have access to these bugs, I am listing them here in case someone on the list can make something happen.  (Opened a month ago. After Tyson reproed the bug in libical, no responses).  The following three bugs are distinct heap over-reads in libical (tested against libical and 1.0) which have had little to no reception by Mozilla.   My roommate mentioned Thunderbird being a second-class citizen in the Mozilla world, so if this is the case, this should be made explicit in regards to bug bounty expectations.
