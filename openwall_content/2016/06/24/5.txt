Full details of the fuzzing project (with analysis of the vulnerabilities) will be released next week.  These issues are fixed in the following commits   And have now been integrated into stable kernel releases: and  Theses issues occurs in the same codepaths as, but are distinct from, a similar vulnerability:  #########  Corrupted offset allows for arbitrary decrements in compat IPT_SO_SET_REPLACE setsockopt  Risk: High  Impact: Kernel memory corruption, leading to elevation of privileges or kernel code execution. This occurs in a compat_setsockopt() call that is normally restricted to root, however, Linux 3/4 kernels that support user and network namespaces can allow an unprivileged user to trigger this functionality. This is exploitable from inside a container.  ##########  Out of bounds reads when processing IPT_SO_SET_REPLACE setsockopt  Risk: Medium  Impact: Out of bounds heap memory access, leading to a Denial of Service (or possibly heap disclosure or further impact). This occurs in a setsockopt() call that is normally restricted to root, however, Linux 3/4 kernels that support user and network namespaces can allow an unprivileged user to trigger this functionality. This is exploitable from inside a container.  ##########   Best, -jh  Content of type "text/html" skipped  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
