Unclear invalid memory read in CPIO parser Sample file  Null pointer access in RAR parser Sample file  Null pointer access in CAB parser Sample file  Overlapping memcpy in CAB parser Sample file  Heap out of bounds read in LHA/LZH parser Sample file  Stack out of bounds read in ar parser Sample file  Global out of bounds read in mtree parser Sample file  Null pointe access in 7z parser Sample file  Unclear crashes in ZIP parser Sample file  Heap out of bounds read in TAR parser Sample file  Unclear invalid memory read in mtree parser Sample file  Null pointer access in RAR parser Sample file  Heap out of bounds heap read read when reading password for malformed ZIP Sample file  Heap out of bounds read in mtree parser https://crashes.fuzzing-project.org/libarchive-oob-process_add_entry.mtree Sample file  I also reported a couple of lower severity issues (leaks, hangs, undefined behavior issues):  Memory leak in TAR parser  Endless loop in ISO parser Sample file  Undefined behavior / signed integer overflow in mtree parser  Use after free in test suite  Undefined behavior / invalid shiftleft in TAR parser https://crashes.fuzzing-project.org/libarchive-undefined-shiftleft Sample file  Undefined behavior / signed integer overflow in TAR parser https://crashes.fuzzing-project.org/libarchive-undefined-signed-overflow.tar Sample file  Unfortunately one out of bounds heap read bug in the RAR parser (sample file) remained unfixed. I hope a fix will find its way into the next version. I was interested in making libarchive more robust because once all issues are fixed it can serve as a safer alternative to many low quality command line tools for various archiving formats.   --  Hanno Bรถck https://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
