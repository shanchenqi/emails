The various write-access observations would then be consequences of this.

(These do not necessarily map directly to the three samples.)  Use for the lack of required NULL pointer checks.  Use for the error in the for statement in the "Compute pixel scaling table" part of the ReadDCMImage function.  Use for the lack of validation of pixel.red, pixel.green, and pixel.blue.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =Pvf8 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
