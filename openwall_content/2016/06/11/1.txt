Description:  An XSS vulnerability was discovered, affecting MantisBT Custom fields  management pages. It is caused by unescaped output of 'return URL' GPC  parameter, and can be exploited as follows:  1. using 'accesskey' inside hidden input field reflects XSS to the     administrator in manage_custom_field_edit_page.php when the keyboard     shortcut is actioned 2. using 'javascript:' URI scheme executes the code when the user clicks     the [Proceed] link on manage_custom_field_update.php after updating     a custom field  Both attack vectors have been addressed:  - properly escape the return URL prior to printing it on the hidden form    field - let html_operation_successful() sanitize the URL before displaying    it, just like html_meta_redirect() does. In this case, if the    string contains an URI scheme, it will be replaced by 'index.php'   Affected versions: and later (possibly older releases as well - not tested)  Fixed in versions: - - As of this writing, these have not been released yet, but both should be  available in the next few days.  Patch: See Github [1]  Credits: The issue was discovered by Kacper Szurek [2] and fixed by Damien Regad (MantisBT Developer).
