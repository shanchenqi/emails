The IKEv1 protocol amplification concern does not make it flawed in a way that would lead to a per-protocol > CVE ID assignment. We are maintaining the ID assignment for the upstream announcement of "libreswan vulnerable to DDOS attack. Please > upgrade to and accompanying upstream patch, as described in the post.  <with upstream libreswan hat on>  If you want us to keep honestly reporting security issues, I recommend you not single out single implementations over RFC compliant protocol flaws.  I'm fine if you list the CVE with the 6 vulnerable implementations, then say libreswan has fixed it.  I'm not okay with libreswan being listed as vulnerable and the other 5 vulnerable implementations not being listed.  If you keep the CVE as-is, we will document it at libreswan.org/security/ as a mis-issued CVE entry.  Related, I would _REALLY_ appreciate it if MITR talks to us before issuing CVE's for our software. We've been at this long before MITR, we respond within days, we are known to have coordinated CVE issues for IKE implementation issues across various implementations. You can contact us at security@...reswan.org, PGP key available at the usual places.
