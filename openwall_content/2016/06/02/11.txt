He marked the issue to be resolved for the next major release, 0.7." In other words, because pypdf2 exists, it is possible to address the specific issue of metadata inside content that is embedded in a PDF.  > Also I wonder if similar bugs happen with other recursive formats, like an > OpenDocument text embedding an image or embedding a pdf embedding an > image or a zip file containing a zip file containing a .odt file > containing an pdf containing an image  https://mat.boum.org/ currently says "MAT does its best to scrub as much metadata as possible, it's not really efficient at scrubbing embedded media inside complex formats. For examples, images embedded inside PDF may not be cleaned!"  We prefer not to make decisions on whether a CVE ID should exist on the basis of ease-of-fix information. In other words, it is difficult to assign CVE IDs if the product's security model is "Complex embedding is, in general, unsupported, but we will make one-off changes for specific embedding scenarios when a solution is provided by a user."  We think you mean that a CVE ID can exist with the rationale of:    - as of version 0.7, there will be a required security update in     which the embedded-in-a-PDF security problem is resolved    - the CVE ID is needed to tag that required security update    - as of version 0.7, the https://mat.boum.org/ text may be changed     from "images embedded inside PDF may not be cleaned" to something     like "images embedded inside complex documents may not be cleaned,     but users can rely on cleaning in the specific case of PDF     documents"  Does that match your intention for the CVE ID?  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  EUj+1IljwFdfd8ojFcHM =l+kk -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
