ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  libxl's device-handling code freely uses and trusts information from the backend directories in xenstore.  The backend domain (driver domain) can store bogus data in the backend, causing libxl's enquiry functions to fail, confusing management tools.  A driver domain can also remove its backend directory from xenstore entirely, preventing the device from showing up in device listings and preventing it from being removed and replaced.  A driver domain can cause libxl to generate disk eject events for disks for which the driver domain is not responsible.  IMPACT ======  A malicious driver domain can deny service to management tools.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  This vulnerability is only applicable to systems which are using driver domains, and then only where the driver domain is not intended to be fully trusted with respect to the host.  Such Xen systems using libxl based toolstacks (for example xl or libvirt with the libxl driver) are vulnerable.  Note that even with this vulnerability a driver domain based system is better from a security point of view, than a system where devices are provided directly by dom0.  Users and vendors of systems using driver domains should not change their configuration.  MITIGATION ==========  No mitigation is available.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Wei Liu from Citrix.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch set from plus the appropriate attached patch set below, resolves this issue.            xen-unstable  $                   $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  HOWEVER note that deployment of the patches for (which are a prerequisite for the patches for is restricted.  See `Deployment During Embargo' section for details.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.   (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
