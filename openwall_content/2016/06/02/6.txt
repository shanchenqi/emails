Overall, this has only minor security implications. Bricking machine doesn't seem to be easily reproducible, since on the second tested mobo it merely showed as a random memory corruption and hard locked system. It requires specific class of external usb devices getting plugged into machine with specific broken xhci controller.  --  Adam MariĹĄ, Red Hat Product Security 1CCD 86AF  2D4C BEF0 6BC2    Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
