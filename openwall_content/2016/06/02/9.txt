Use  The scope of this CVE is the missing "dmalen > TI_BUFSZ" check in the get_cmd function. The scope of this CVE does not include the "At least the following patch is needed to ensure that ti_size always matches ti_rptr/ti_wptr" discussion.  This is not yet available at http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=history;f=hw/scsi/esp.c but that may be an expected place for a later update.   >> In theory this shouldn't happen, but I agree that it is better to be >> defensive.  We typically can still assign a CVE ID with that response. We cannot assign a CVE ID with a response of "there is no vulnerability but I'm accepting the defense-in-depth code change." Admittedly this is sometimes a difficult distinction.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  DB5KI7w/WY+cLrwaUhxv =kY8R -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
