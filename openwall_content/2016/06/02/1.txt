By rescoping a token a user will receive a new token without correct audit_ids, these incorrect audit_ids will prevent the entire chain of tokens from being revoked properly. This vulnerability does not impact revoking a token by its individual audit_id. Only deployments with Keystone configured to use Fernet tokens are impacted.
