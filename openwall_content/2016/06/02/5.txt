The bug is that it doesnt remove metadata from images embedded in PDFs (while it does remove metadata from PDFs and from imagesâŚ)  So basically the core feature of mat is partly broken :/ So I think this warrants a CVE as IMHO this ain't just a missing feature and folks on the #debian-security IRC channel agreed.  This issue is being tracked by it's developers as and in Debian as and affects all versions of mat and is not fixed anywhere yet.  Could a CVE please be assigned to this issue?   Also I wonder if similar bugs happen with other recursive formats, like an OpenDocument text embedding an image or embedding a pdf embedding an image or a zip file containing a zip file containing a .odt file containing an pdf containing an imageâŚ   --  thanks, 	Holger (not subscribed to the list, please cc: me on replies.)
