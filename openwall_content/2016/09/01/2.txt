Once a machine joins, it becomes a Swarm Node. Nodes can either be worker nodes or manager nodes. I found a vulnerability in docker of the latest version which could cause a Denial of Service, I created a CA certificate as the same way with docker, loading it when execute the command "docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-xx ip:port", however , distrust certificate results the swarm manger failed to authenticate during TLS handshake, trapping into infinite loop of session rebuilding , thus a remote node could not join the swarm cluster and even force to leave is in vain, this issue persists after restarts docker daemon on the remote node.  # docker version Client: Version:      API version:  Go version:   Git commit:   Built:        Fri Jul 29 OS/Arch:      linux/amd64  Server: Version:      API version:  Go version:   Git commit:   Built:        Fri Jul 29 OS/Arch:      linux/amd64  # docker swarm init Swarm initialized: current node is now a manager.  To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:     docker swarm join \     --token \      To add a manager to this swarm, run the following command:     docker swarm join \     --token \     xx.xx.xx.xx  Login in remote node ,create a CA certificate and private key as the docker’s way, then puts them to /var/lib/docker/swarm/certificate and named with “docker-swarm-ca.xxx”, execute the following commands: ----------------------------------------------------- # docker swarm join --token Error response from daemon: Timeout was reached before node was joined. Attempt to join the cluster will continue in the background. Use "docker info" command to see the current swarm status of your node  Some debugging information of docker daemon.         --------------------------------------------------------- level=debug msg="(*session).start" module=agent level=error msg="agent: session failed" error="session initiation timed out" module=agent level=debug msg="agent: rebuild session" module=agent level=debug msg="(*session).start" module=agent level=error msg="agent: session failed" error="session initiation timed out" module=agent level=debug msg="agent: rebuild session" module=agent … …   now that we can’t join the swarm cluster, so just leave it,  but… # docker swarm leave --force Error response from daemon: context deadline exceeded    Ok, nothing can be done with swarm mode, neither joining nor quiting  Please assign CVE IDs for the security issue ?
