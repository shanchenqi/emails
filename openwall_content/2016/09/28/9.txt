After failing the assertion, PID 1 hangs in the pause system call. It is no longer possible to start and stop daemons or cleanly reboot the system.

Since the notification socket, /run/systemd/notify, is world-writable, this allows a local user to perform a denial-of-service attack against systemd.  Proof-of-concept:          NOTIFY_SOCKET=/run/systemd/notify systemd-notify ""  This vulnerability is present in all versions of systemd since at least  This has been reported to systemd.[4]  [1] https://github.com/systemd/systemd/ [2] [3] [4]  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
