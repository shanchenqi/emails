The main thing to investigate is if the "ImageTragick" patches distributions are using do protect against this possible issue as well. >  You know, you reminded me that the pdf and/or the ps delegate probably allows filesystem enumeration via filenameforall, as far as I know that's permitted with -dSAFER. I think that's probably unexpected.  For example, if you try to identify a file like this, it will list local usernames on stdout, I guess a real attack would have to encode that in the output somehow, but I only know enough postscript to know i'd rather write bf. Might be a fun exercise for masochistic hackers though.  $ cat whatever.jpeg %PDF-1.0 (/home/*) {==} string filenameforall $ identify whatever.jpeg (/home/taviso) identify.im6: Postscript delegate failed `whatever.jpeg': No such file or directory @  Tavis.
