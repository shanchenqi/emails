The issue exists in image converting, there must be a possibility that it extracts embedded layer data to arbitrary directories or paths since no essential check for the output file path. Could you please assign a CVE number for it? Thanks.    Source info    tmpLayerPath := path.Join(tmpDir, layerIDs[i])           tmpLayerPath += ".tar"           layerFile, err := extractEmbeddedLayer(lb.file, layerIDs[i], tmpLayerPath)// without essential check for layerpath, may breakout tmpDir.    Proof-of-concept    Build or downloading a malicious image as an archive file, containing some layer files with relative names ,like “../../../etc/ filename”, as well modifying the content of some corresponding json file related to it. then running docker2aci to convert the docker’s image to aci. Overview of the content of malicious image:  ../../../etc       and logs:          tmpDir:  tmpLayerPath:  Extracting ../../../etc  then check the results:  ls /etc/*.tar  Of course, the tar file content could be modified by yourself.
