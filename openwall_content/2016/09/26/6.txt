I'm Lian ,a security researcher from Qihoo .    I found a vulnerability of ffmpeg . And this could cause ffmpeg get into endless loop !  >  > ================== target system ======================  >  > ffmpeg version Copyright (c)  >  > Ffmpeg -i poc.swf -b:v -y output.ts  >  > ================== target web site ======================  >  > https://ffmpeg.org/  >  > ========================= key codes ======================  >  > swfdec.c: line  >  > zlib_refill()  > {    > retry:    > ret = inflate(z, Z_NO_FLUSH); // ret is always 2 (Z_NEED_DICT) , and other variates will not been changed.    > if (buf_size - z->avail_out == 0)  >  goto retry;      Our understanding is that swfdec.c is part of the libavformat library and thus this issue may affect other applications that use that library.
