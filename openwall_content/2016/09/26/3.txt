This is PwChen of Tencent's Xuanwu Lab & RayZhong of Tencent's Keen Lab.  During our research, we found an Out-Of-Bounds write vulnerability in ImageMagick's BMP coders.  When ImageMagick is converting other format to BMP format, it will pass image's height and width parameter into 'BMP coder'.  There is an arithmetic overflow vulnerability when the BMP coder is calculating the image size by multiplying the height and width. This can directly cause an Out-Of-Bounds Write.  The ImageMagick team has fixed the vulnerability we reported.  Attached is a proof of concept.  python -c 'print > PoC.ppm convert PoC.ppm crash.bmp   Upstream fix:  Debian Bug report:   Regards, Peiwen Chen Tencent's Xuanwu Lab  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
