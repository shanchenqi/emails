On the BSDs TIOCSTI has been limited to the superuser since the 4.4BSD Lite 2 release in (IIRC). I think that linux should follow suit if it has not (yet). For those who are interested in the history of this, I believe that first we checked only the userid (4.2BSD), then we checked the userid and that the process was a session leader (4.3BSD), and finally we decided that this was too big of a hole and limited it to the superuser.  christos  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
