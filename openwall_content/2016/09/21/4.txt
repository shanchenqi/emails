I reported some security issues to ExponentCMS some days ago.    # Test environment exponent version: latest php: 5.5.x server: apache 2.2.x   # Details   1. Unrestricted File Upload there is a unrestricted file upload issue at framework/modules/forms/controllers/formsController.php and the upload file is located at /tmp/, where php script can be executed.   although we dont know file name, but we can brute it simply, such as time() + "_" + upload name.       public function import_csv_mapper() {         //Check to make sure the user filled out the required input.         if (!is_numeric($this->params["rowstart"])) {             unset($this->params["rowstart"]);             $this->params['_formError'] = gt('The starting row must be a number.');             expSession::set("last_POST", $this->params);             header("Location: " . $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER']);             exit('Redirecting...');         }           if (!empty($this->params['forms_id'])) {             // if we are importing to an existing form, jump to that step             $this->import_csv_data_mapper();         } else {             //Get the temp directory to put the uploaded file             $directory = "tmp";               //Get the file save it to the temp directory             if ($_FILES["upload"]["error"] == UPLOAD_ERR_OK) {                 //	$file = file::update("upload",$directory,null,time()."_".$_FILES['upload']['name']);                 $file = expFile::fileUpload("upload", false, false, time() . "_" . $_FILES['upload']['name'], $directory.'/'); //FIXME quick hack to remove file model 	....   POC:    	<!DOCTYPE html> 	<html> 	<form method="POST" enctype ="multipart/form-data"> 	<input type="file" name="upload">	 	<input type="submit" name="submit">   	</form> 	</html>   2. LFI   then LFI comes, at       <?php     $page = (isset($_REQUEST['page']) ? expString::sanitize($_REQUEST['page']) : '');     if (is_readable('popups/' . $page . '.php')) {         include('popups/' . $page . '.php');     }     ?>   so we can upload a php file, then include it to make a RCE again.   POC:      3. Unrestricted File Upload and RCE   there is a unrestricted file upload issue at framework/modules/forms/controllers/formsController.php and the upload file is located at /tmp/, where php script can be executed.   although we dont know file name, but we can brute it simply, such as time() + "_" + name.       public function import_csv_mapper() {         //Check to make sure the user filled out the required input.         if (!is_numeric($this->params["rowstart"])) {             unset($this->params["rowstart"]);             $this->params['_formError'] = gt('The starting row must be a number.');             expSession::set("last_POST", $this->params);             header("Location: " . $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER']);             exit('Redirecting...');         }           if (!empty($this->params['forms_id'])) {             // if we are importing to an existing form, jump to that step             $this->import_csv_data_mapper();         } else {             //Get the temp directory to put the uploaded file             $directory = "tmp";               //Get the file save it to the temp directory             if ($_FILES["upload"]["error"] == UPLOAD_ERR_OK) {                 //	$file = file::update("upload",$directory,null,time()."_".$_FILES['upload']['name']);                 $file = expFile::fileUpload("upload", false, false, time() . "_" . $_FILES['upload']['name'], $directory.'/'); //FIXME quick hack to remove file model 	....
