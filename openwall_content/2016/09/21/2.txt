Proof of concept: http://www.exponentcms.org/external/worldpay/callback.php And post:transStatus="/><script>alert(/xss/)</script>   And Now, Cross Site Scripting vulnerability have been fixed.  This issue was reported by Peng Hua of silence.com.cn Inc. and I would like to request a CVE for this issue (if not done so).  Thank you. ---------------------------------http://www.silence.com.cn penghua#silence.com.cn PKAV Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
