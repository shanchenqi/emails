The worker fails because the author messed with the local state.  This does not make the manager not available to the rest of the worker nodes, and is essentially a self-DoS (I modified my local configuration in such a way that docker doesn't run).  A simple rm -rf /var/lib/docker/swarm should clean all the state. Not CVE worthy.  --  Diogo Mรณnica   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
