You have a token that allows you to join an unlimited number of workers. The system supports N workers, you join N + 1, the system starts rejecting new workers.  No malicious attacker can ever join any workers unless they have the token, and if you are paranoid, you can always rotate the secret token after each worker join.   > Regardless of whether this is CVE worthy is there any plan to add rate > limiting or other protective measures to prevent a single badly > behaved/malicious node from making the swarm unable to operate normally?

I'm here to get this CVE rescinded, since there is no reason for its existence in the first place.  If you'd like to discuss any other matters related to docker or swarm, feel free to do so by either open an issue on our GH repository, or our forums: https://forums.docker.com.
