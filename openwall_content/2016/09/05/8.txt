(We realize that the file is m_sasl.c, the function is m_authenticate, and the array is parv in both the Charybdis case and the UnrealIRCd case, but we decided not to try to share a CVE ID between these two products.)  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =c9S9 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
