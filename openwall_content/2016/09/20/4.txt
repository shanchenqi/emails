We are not sure whether it makes sense to assign a CVE ID to a mathematical fact of that form. The vulnerability seems to be that the TLS protocol definition allows rsa_fixed_dh, dss_fixed_dh, rsa_fixed_ecdh, and ecdsa_fixed_ecdh, but protocol documentation such as RFC Appendix F does not explicitly point out the severity of the outcome when any arbitrary installed client certificate is compromised. It does, for example, say "For TLS to be able to provide a secure connection, both the client and server systems, keys, and applications must be secure," but it doesn't delineate the level of connection insecurity that results from a seemingly minor client insecurity.  Use for this vulnerability in the TLS documentation.  It is possible that other issues described in the woot15-paper-hlauschek.pdf paper, such as issues related to handling of key usage extensions, need their own separate CVE IDs.  In addition, as suggested by section 5.2, a product that originally shipped with a compromised client certificate should, in many cases, be considered a vulnerable product, regardless of whether that client certificate has any known use for authenticating a client. We don't know whether there are a huge number of products that have, for example, installed test client certificates. Our initial thought is that there should be a unique CVE ID for any product that satisfies these criteria:   - when the product was shipped, a default or recommended    configuration had an installed client certificate and associated    secret key that were both known to the general public (e.g., they    were known by anyone who had a copy of the product)   - the product can be used in a KCI attack, e.g., it meets all of the    requirements of section   - the product could realistically be expected to need secure    communication with a server for which a certificate exists, from a    commonly recognized Certification Authority, meeting the    requirements of section (e.g., this would often exclude a    product that can establish TLS sessions only to a server operated    by the vendor)  Post-shipment compromise of a client certificate's secret key is currently outside the scope of CVE. The vulnerable behavior is releasing a product where a client certificate is installed and its secret key is already publicly documented.  Third-party suggestions for improving warning messages for client-certificate installation are also currently outside the scope of CVE. Although it might be nice for some products to have a warning of "Are you completely sure that you want to install this client certificate because no unauthorized party knows the secret key?" (or similar), we don't want to have free-for-all CVE ID assignment. For now, we'll let vendors have CVE IDs if they decide their existing certificate-installation dialog is a security problem and they compose a better dialog warning that's understandable by their customers.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  AsswVVMQxPKkbxx40iqM =zIPv -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
