While the symptoms are similar to (Re-using connection with wrong client cert), this vulnerability was caused by an implementation detail of the NSS backend in libcurl, which is orthogonal to the cause of  We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.  INFO ----  This flaw also affects the curl command line tool.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name to this issue.  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  This flaw is present in curl and libcurl only if they are built with the support for NSS and only if the libnsspem.so library is available at run-time.  - Affected versions: libcurl to and including - Not affected versions: libcurl >=  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!  THE SOLUTION ------------  A fix for this flaw is included in libcurl via [commit For older releases of libcurl there is a [patch for  RECOMMENDATIONS ---------------  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:    A - Apply the patch on the source code of libcurl and rebuild.    B - Configure libcurl to use a different TLS backend and rebuild.    C - Use certificates from NSS database instead of loading them from files.  TIME LINE ---------  This flaw was reported by Red Hat on August 22nd.  The patch fixing the flaw was published on September 5th.  was assigned to this flaw on September 6th.
