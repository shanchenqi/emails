It fixes several  security issues:  1. A last instance of (heap buffer overflow) in the MVG  rendering code (also impacts SVG).  This problem was originally  reported by Gustavo Grieco.  2. A possible heap overflow of the EscapeParenthesis() function.  While I was not able to reproduce it for myself, the implementation is  replaced with a different algorithm.  This problem was reported by  Gustavo Grieco.  3. The Utah RLE reader did not validate that header information was  reasonable given the file size and so it could cause huge memory  allocations and/or consume huge amounts of CPU.  This problem was  reported by Agostino Sarubbo.  4. The TIFF reader had a bug pertaining to use of TIFFGetField() when  a 'count' value is returned.  The bug caused a heap read overflow (due  to using strlcpy() to copy a possibly unterminated string) which could  allow an untrusted file to crash the software.  The project appreciates the time and effort that various security  researchers have expended to identify security issues with the  software so that they may be fixed.
