When RHEL7 is booted with UEFI Secure Boot enabled, securelevel is set. The kernel uses the state of securelevel to prevent userspace from inserting untrusted privileged code at runtime.  The ACPI tables provided by firmware can be overwritten using the initrd. From the kernel documentation:    If the ACPI_INITRD_TABLE_OVERRIDE compile option is true, it is possible to   override nearly any ACPI table provided by the BIOS with an instrumented,   modified one.  RHEL7 has CONFIG_ACPI_INITRD_TABLE_OVERRIDE kernel config option enabled, and will load ACPI tables appended to the initrd, even if booted with UEFI Secure Boot enabled and securelevel set.  Upstream patch:  The securelevel patchset was not accepted to an upstream kernel, see http://www.zdnet.com/article/matthew-garrett-is-not-forking-linux/ and ,it is maintained now by MJG: https://github.com/mjg59/linux .  was assigned to this security flaw internally by the Red Hat.
