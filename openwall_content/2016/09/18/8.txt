CVE does not support the concept of a different "instance" of an ID number that has different affected versions. For the aspect of the heap buffer overflow issue in MVG/SVG rendering that remained present in the release (and was not fixed until use  This should be considered a clarification to the following NEWS excerpts:        (May 30,    SVG: Fixed heap and stack buffer overflows, as well as segmentation    violations and        (September 5,    SVG/MVG: Fix another case of (heap buffer overflow)    in the MVG rendering code (also impacts SVG).   > 2.

Use for all of these reported TIFF problems. The ultimate vulnerability was use of:    strlcpy(attribute,text,Min(sizeof(attribute),(count+1)));  three times in coders/tiff.c, where strlcpy is not an appropriate function choice for this type of scenario of untrusted-data copying.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =DLQk -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
