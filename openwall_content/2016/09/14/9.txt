At least for some projects, if a vulnerability is already public or becomes public prior to requesting a CVE privately from some CNA, it makes more sense to go ahead and widely inform the community (via this ML and elsewhere) and then associate a CVE with it afterward. While having a unique identifier is important, I think rapid dissemination of vulnerabilities so that downstream users can patch their systems is more important. --  Jeremy Stanley  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
