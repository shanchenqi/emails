The first one has different exposure for client/server parts so I assume it should have separate CVEs?  Cheers, Matt (please CC replies)  - 21 July  - Security: Message printout was vulnerable to format string injection.    If specific usernames including "%" symbols can be created on a system   (validated by getpwnam()) then an attacker could run arbitrary code as root   when connecting to Dropbear server.    A dbclient user who can control username or host arguments could potentially   run arbitrary code as the dbclient user. This could be a problem if scripts   or webpages pass untrusted input to the dbclient program.    - Security: dropbearconvert import of OpenSSH keys could run arbitrary code as   the local dropbearconvert user when parsing malicious key files    - Security: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if   particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where   dbclient is used in scripts.    - Security: dbclient or dropbear server could expose process memory to the   running user if compiled with DEBUG_TRACE and running with -v      The security issues were reported by an anonymous researcher working with   Beyond Security's SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure www.beyondsecurity.com/ssd.html  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
