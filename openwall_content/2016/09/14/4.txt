That's true, but I never did in the past, as this mailing list is (or was?) monitored by mitre, so posting here has been sufficient until now.   Furthermore in this case I was not quite certain that a CVE was actually required for this, so I was kind of hoping for guidance.   > Also note that there are new procedures, including a request > form, in addition to the previous recommendation to contact a CNA > https://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html  I was not aware of that, thanks for the heads up. Will follow these guidelines and use the form in the future.
