I don't like the idea of waiting on CVE assignment before posting information here:  - MITRE's team does impressive work, but some assignments take   significantly longer than others; a request here, publicly, allows users   to mitigate or fix before a number is known.  - In cases when there are no fixes yet, or incomplete fixes, it may not be   known how many CVEs are even needed -- making the issues widely known   earlier increases the chances of someone preparing patches, to clarify   how many issues existed.  - With MITRE's reduced scope of CVE coverage, there's the risk that   software that's important to list members or the wider computing public   may not get a number at all. Not getting a number assigned may give the   impression that the issue isn't important.
