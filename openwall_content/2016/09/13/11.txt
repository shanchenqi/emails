The referenced web site provides the advice "Do it âat the edgeâ,  where HTTP requests first enter your system.".  In this case libxml2  is not the edge.  The edge is the parser which accepts the CGI  requests.  Adding detection of "REQUEST_METHOD" to libxml2 may reduce the  potential menace.  The libxml2 developers should have responded to you but I can see why  they would not consider this to be their problem.  If you break libxml2 support for HTTP_PROXY (and/or http_proxy) then  the proxy capabilty can't be used outside of CGI applications, which  is likely to break existing valid uses.
