No write access is reported. Also, running etterlog on an arbitrary attacker-modified .ecp or .eci file probably would occur very rarely.  The "(three) heap-based buffer overflow" report is exclusively about "AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow ... READ." It's apparently about an attacker who fuzzes a file so that an IP address-length field is a large number rather than, for example, 4 or 32. A memcmp reads out-of-bounds data but the flow of control isn't altered. Also, this happens in the etterlog source code (utils/etterlog/el_profiles.c), not in library code that might be used in other applications.  We feel that these crashes are just an inconvenience, not a security risk, and there are no CVE IDs at this time.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =fytj -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
