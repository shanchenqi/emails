Basically, the tool should read what you capture with YOUR ettercap, but since  ettercap is one of the valid tools for MITM, there are dozens of blog post  about how to use it, so there could be posts where malicious users make  available crafted datafile to show something.  Details:    If you think that something is suitable for an identifier, please assign one. Thanks.  -- Agostino  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
