PowerDNS Authoritative 4.0.x and PowerDNS Recursor are not affected.  The corresponding security advisory is provided below, and can also be found at:  Please feel free to contact me directly if you have any question.   PowerDNS Security Advisory Crafted queries can cause unexpected backend load  CVE: Date: 9th of September Credit: Florian Heinz and Martin Kluge Affects: PowerDNS Authoritative Server up to and including Not affected: PowerDNS Authoritative Server 4.x Severity: Medium Impact: Degraded service or Denial of service Exploit: This problem can be triggered by sending specially crafted query packets Risk of system compromise: No Solution: Upgrade to a non-affected version Workaround: Run dnsdist with the rules provided below in front of potentially affected servers, or dimension the backend capacity so that it can handle the increased load.  Two issues have been found in PowerDNS Authoritative Server allowing a remote, unauthenticated attacker to cause an abnormal load on the PowerDNS backend by sending crafted DNS queries, which might result in a partial denial of service if the backend becomes overloaded. SQL backends for example are particularly vulnerable to this kind of unexpected load if they have not been dimensioned for it. The first issue is based on the fact that PowerDNS Authoritative Server accepts queries with a qname's length larger than bytes. This issue has been assigned The second issue is based on the fact that PowerDNS Authoritative Server does not properly handle dot inside labels. This issue has been assigned Both issues have been addressed by this commit:  PowerDNS Authoritative Server up to and including is affected. No other versions are affected. The PowerDNS Recursor is not affected.  dnsdist can be used to block crafted queries, using QNameWireLengthRule() to block queries with a qname larger than bytes and QNameLabelsCountRule() to block queries with a very large amount of labels. Please note that restricting the number of labels in a query might lead to unexpected issues, especially with DNSSEC-enabled domains.  We'd like to thank Florian Heinz and Martin Kluge for finding and subsequently reporting this issue.   --  Remi Gacogne PowerDNS.COM BV - https://www.powerdns.com/    Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
