If not, do you have access to any of the Google web pages that might contain the CVE ID if it exists?  An attempt to retrieve the above cr-rev.appspot.com URL results in:    Location:  and that second URL results in:    Not Found  Also, refers to but that is currently not a public bug page.  Finally, indicates that this is an issue in the examples/pngdec.c file. A crash bug in an example program does not necessarily qualify for a CVE ID. However, in this case, examples/pngdec.c is apparently used to build a library called libexample_dec, and it's conceivable that arbitrary applications rely on libexample_dec. (It also seems unlikely that a Google product relies on libexample_dec; that may be a reason that Google did not assign a CVE ID.)  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =scJU -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
