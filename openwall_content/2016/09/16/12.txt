To clarify: this is only triggered if the hostname has been set, not the $HOSTNAME variable, right?  Your subject line suggests setting $HOSTNAME would lead to command execution, which would be a vulnerability reminiscent of shellshock, but quickly glancing at the code, it looks like $HOSTNAME is only used if gethostname(3) returned an empty string?  -Jan  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
