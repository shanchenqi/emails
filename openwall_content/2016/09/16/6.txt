Two out of bounds bugs in the glib library were uncovered by running the test suite with Address Sanitizer enabled. One heap buffer overflow in the parameter parsing of gnome-session was uncovered by trying to start GNOME. Given that these bugs weren't discovered earlier means that most likely nobody ever used Address Sanitizer to test GNOME components.  I strongly recommend to GNOME and to other software communities to use Address Sanitizer testing in order to improve the quality of their software.
