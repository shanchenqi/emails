Bash doesn't use $HOSTNAME; it sets it if it's not already set.  The shell's idea of the current hostname is set using gethostname().  If gethostname() fails, the hostname gets set to "??host??".  The \h prompt expansion uses the shell's idea of the current hostname.  If your privileged application (either a user with privilege or a hostname- setting agent) allows the hostname to be set to any arbitrary string of characters, you're going to have problems regardless.
