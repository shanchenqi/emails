I finally got this message, three hours later.  I assume you're using $HOSTNAME as a shorthand; bash only uses the return value from gethostname().  It's unlikely that something like this could be accomplished without existing privilege.  If you have a fake DHCP server on your network, for instance, you have massive problems aside from this issue.  If someone sets the hostname on the local machine, he already has privilege.  >  > I believe the fix in parse.y is this (Chet, please correct me if I'm wrong):  Yes, that is the current fix for this.  There are other ways to do it.  This issue has been public since October, in Ubuntu's bash bug database.   --  ``The lyf so short, the craft so long to lerne.'' - Chaucer 		 ``Ars longa, vita brevis'' - Hippocrates Chet Ramey, UTech, CWRU    chet@...e.edu    http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/~chet/  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
