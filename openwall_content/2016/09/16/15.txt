The issue has been already acknowledged and patched in a development branch, the patch is here:   this patch have been applied to a 4.9 scsi branch here (4.9/scsi-queue), and at some point it will land in master   Thanks  Marco  https://marcograss.github.io  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
