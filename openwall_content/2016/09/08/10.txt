ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  When emulating HVM instructions, Xen uses a small i-cache for fetches from guest memory.  The code that handles cache misses does not check if the address from which it fetched lies within the cache before blindly writing to it.  As such it is possible for the guest to overwrite hypervisor memory.  It is currently believed that the only way to trigger this bug is to use the way that Xen currently incorrectly wraps CS:IP in 16 bit modes.  The included patch prevents such wrapping.  IMPACT ======  A malicious HVM guest administrator can escalate their privilege to that of the host.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen versions and later are vulnerable. Xen releases and are vulnerable.  Xen releases to inclusive are NOT vulnerable. Xen releases and earlier are NOT vulnerable.  The vulnerability is only exposed to HVM guests on x86 hardware.  The vulnerability is not exposed to x86 PV guests, or ARM guests.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only PV guests will avoid this vulnerability.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Brian Marcotte.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the first patch will resolve the issue.  Users wishing to independently verify the correctness of the fix may find the second patch helpful.  The second patch makes it easier to use the "fep" (Force Emulation Prefix) feature to reproduce the erroneous condition in a test environment.  The "fep" feature requires explicit enablement on the hypervisor command line, and is unsuitable for production systems.  Accordingly, applying the second patch does not affect production systems and does not improve security.  Xen version     First patch               Second patch  xen-unstable:          Xen 4.7.x:             Xen             Xen             $     $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
