ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  When the EVTCHNOP_init_control operation is called with a bad guest frame number, it takes an error path which frees a control structure without also clearing the corresponding pointer.  Certain subsequent operations (EVTCHNOP_expand_array or another EVTCHNOP_init_control), upon finding the non-NULL pointer, continue operation assuming it points to allocated memory.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest administrator can crash the host, leading to a DoS. Arbitrary code execution (and therefore privilege escalation), and information leaks, cannot be excluded.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Only Xen 4.4 is vulnerable.  Xen versions 4.5 and later as well as Xen versions 4.3 and earlier are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  There is no mitigation available.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Mikhail Gorobets of Advanced Threat Research, Intel Security.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.            Xen 4.4.x  $  $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =jzF5 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
