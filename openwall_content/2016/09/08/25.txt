Can you please post the contents of your report and Tavis' reply (as well as any other relevant replies) as a reply to this same thread here on oss-security?  > Please tell how I can send crashes archive, thank you  If your entire message including the 4/3 MIME overhead would be below KB, then please just attach this archive to the message.  Otherwise please come up with a smaller testcase (and attach it) or use an external URL for the file (but accessible to everyone without having to log in).  The former is strongly preferred.
