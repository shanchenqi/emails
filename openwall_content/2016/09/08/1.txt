For example, an attacker-controlled torrent tracker can crash victim torrent  clients by sending malformed GZIP responses.  This bug has been fixed by the maintainer in master and the branch RC_1_1:    I also tested the bug with two "Libtorrent based" softwares : qBittorrent and Deluge. Both of them were affected and crashed on receiving the malformed response.
