(Debug builds should not be used in production.)  Public release.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  x86 HVM guests running with shadow paging use a subset of the x86 emulator to handle the guest writing to its own pagetables.  There are situations a guest can provoke which result in exceeding the space allocated for internal state.   IMPACT ======  A malicious HVM guest administrator can cause Xen to fail a bug check, causing a denial of service to the host.   VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All versions of Xen are vulnerable.  The vulnerability is only exposed to HVM guests on x86 hardware, which are configured to run with shadow paging.  The vulnerability is not exposed to x86 PV guests, x86 HVM guests running with hardware assisted paging, or ARM guests.   x86 HVM guests run in HAP mode by default on modern CPUs.  To discover whether your HVM guests are using HAP, or shadow page tables: request debug key `q' (from the Xen console, or with `xl debug-keys q').  This will print (to the console, and visible in `xl dmesg'), debug information for every domain, containing something like this:    (XEN) General information for domain 2:   (XEN)     refcnt=1 dying=2 pause_count=2   (XEN)     nr_pages=2 xenheap_pages=0 shared_pages=0 paged_pages=0 dirty_cpus={}   (XEN)       (XEN)     paging assistance: hap refcounts translate external                                ^^^ The presence of `hap' here indicates that the host is not vulnerable to this domain.  For an HVM domain the presence of `shadow' indicates that the domain can exploit the vulnerability.   MITIGATION ==========  Running only PV guests will avoid this vulnerability.  On hardware which supports Hardware Assisted Paging, configuring the guests to not run with shadow paging will avoid this vulnerability.   CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Andrew Cooper of Citrix.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the first patch will resolve this issue.  The second patch provides additional assurance that the vulnerability is truly eliminated and that there are no related problems.  If hotpatching, applying only the first patch is recommended since the second patch is awkward for hotpatching.  If deploying new builds, applying both patches is recommended.  Xen version     First patch               Second patch  xen-unstable:          Xen 4.7.x:         Xen 4.6.x:         Xen 4.5.x:         Xen 4.4.x:         $       $   DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the "reconfigure to use HAP" MITIGATION is NOT permitted (except where all the affected systems and VMs are administered and used only by organisations which are members of the Xen Project Security Issues Predisclosure List).  Specifically, deployment on public cloud systems is NOT permitted.  This is because the mitigation result in guest-visible changes.  Deployment of this mitigation is permitted only AFTER the embargo ends.   Deployment of the PATCHES described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).   Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.   (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
