The reporter simply claims that no new nodes can join the swarm:  "it results in a machine could not join the swarm cluster after another node’s repeatedly joining and quitting the swarm"  As we describe in our documentation, possession of the token gives the permission to join new workers. Joining new workers effectively means reserving some resources for your worker. If the system runs out of resources, I believe it is expected that no new workers should be able to join.  Again, this is simply not a vulnerability of either Docker swarm or Docker swarmkit, and I kindly request that this CVE is rescinded.
