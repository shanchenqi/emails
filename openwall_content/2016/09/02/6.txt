Solar just reminded me of this branch of this old thread, prompting me to tighten up OpenSSH's privilege separation monitor process:   (there'll be another one for GSSAPI once I can find someone to test it)  Together these more rigorously and explicitly enforce the expected request flow in the monitor process.
