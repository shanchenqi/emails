The problem is that you could sneak an unicode string terminator in the kdesu invocation and the label showing which command will be executed ended there but we did execute the whole thing, that is,       echo Hi@; whoami > /tmp/filebyroot  If @ is the unicode string terminator would only tell the user kdesu would execute "echo Hi" but would create the /tmp/filebyroot file as root  The fix is already available at  Thanks,   Albert  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
