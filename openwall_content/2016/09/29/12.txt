Note, this was fixed many months ago, in May of and went into the stable kernel updates in June,  Any distro that updated to the stable kernel updates received this fix then.  Any distro that hasn't updated their kernel since then, well, you need to revaluate your trust of such a distro :)  thanks,  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
