MyFaces Trinidad is a feature-rich renderkit for JavaServer(tm) Faces that provides an extendibles framework and extensive skinning support. This version is designed to be used with the JSF 2.1 specification.  Trinidad’s CoreResponseStateManager both reads and writes view state strings using ObjectInputStream/ObjectOutputStream directly.  By doing so, Trinidad bypasses the view state security features provided by the JSF implementations - ie. the view state is not encrypted and is not MAC’ed.  Trinidad’s CoreResponseStateManager will blindly deserialize untrusted view state strings, which makes Trinidad-based applications vulnerable to deserialization attacks.  Apache MyFaces Trinidad is available in both binary and source distributions, and there are examples available as well:      * http://myfaces.apache.org/trinidad/download.html  Apache MyFaces Trinidad is available in the central Maven repository under Group ID "org.apache.myfaces.trinidad"  Release Notes - MyFaces Trinidad - Version  Bug     - MyFaces Trinidad view state deserialization security vulnerability      - java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException     - In validateLength, a default hintRange message is displayed instead of hintMaximum even when minimum value is not set     - We should update Table's selection state during invoke application phase     - Prevent exceptions from propagating out of the ServletFilter     - Check UTF-8 encoding in example files  Improvement      - Improve the ancestor based change filtering mechanism by introducing a formal ComponentChangeFilter     - URLUtil to escape a URL and remove invalid characters     - Align Trinidad 2.1.x so it can be editable using Netbeans 8  regards,  Mike Kienenberger  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
