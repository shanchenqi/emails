The wrongly written byte is the least significant byte of the 'dnsclass' argument; most commonly 1.  We have been seen proof of concept code showing how this can be exploited in a real-world system, but we are not aware of any such instances having actually happened in the wild.  INFO ----  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name to this issue.  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  This flaw exists in the following c-ares versions.  - Affected versions: libcurl to and including - Not affected versions: c-ares >=  THE SOLUTION ------------  In version the function has been corrected and a test case have been added to verify.  A [patch for is available.  RECOMMENDATIONS ---------------  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:    A - Upgrade c-ares to version    B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild    C - Make *really* sure you don't pass in strings to either of these functions       that use escaped trailing dots.  TIME LINE ---------  It was reported to the c-ares project on September 22 by Gzob Qq.  c-ares was released on September 29 coordinated with the publication of this advisory.  CREDITS -------  Thanks to Gzob Qq for the report and to Mattias Nissler for code reviews of the patch.  --     / daniel.haxx.se  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
