I have attached a sample code for libfuzzer which shows how this works. (In case anyone cares: Consider it being public domain / CC0 / whatever licensing terms you like)  Takes only a few seconds without any starting corpus to find this bug.  --  Hanno Bรถck https://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  View attachment "libfuzzer-ares_create_query.cpp" of type "text/x-c++src" bytes)  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
