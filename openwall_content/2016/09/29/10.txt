Due to the number of users running vulnerable code(not update to 4.7 or higher), and that this exploit is only available to security researchers and kernel packagers upon request but that I don't want it to spread.  I have reported this issue to Linux kernel official and they have already fixed this. And I would like to request CVE-ID for this issue.  DESCRIPTION =========== The IPv6 netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel through does not validate certain offset fields, which allows local users to escalade privileges via an IP6T_SO_SET_REPLACE compat setsockopt call  PRODUCTS AFFECTED ================== Linux Kernel through Ubuntu Ubuntu  VULNERABILITY DETAILS ==================== In check_compat_entry_size_and_hooks(struct compat_ip6t_entry *e, . . .) { xt_ematch_foreach(ematch, e) {                    ret = compat_find_calc_match(ematch, &e->ipv6, &off);                    if (ret != 0)                             goto release_matches;                   ++j; }  t = compat_ip6t_get_target(e); target = xt_request_find_target(NFPROTO_IPV6, t->u.user.name, t->u.user.revision);  t->u.kernel.target = target; }  struct xt_entry_target * compat_ip6t_get_target(struct compat_ip6t_entry *e) {          return (void *)e + e->target_offset; }  /* can only be xt_entry_match, so no use of typeof here */ #define xt_ematch_foreach(pos, entry) \          for ((pos) = (struct xt_entry_match *)entry->elems; \             (pos) < (struct xt_entry_match *)((char *)(entry) + \                  (entry)->target_offset); \             (pos) = (struct xt_entry_match *)((char *)(pos) + \             (pos)->u.match_size))  The entry->target_offset field didn’t verification well, so that it can cause a memory corruption via t->u.kernel.target = target  CREDIT ====== This issue was discovered by Qian Zhang@...velTeam Qihoo  PATCH ===========  regards, Qian Zhang@...velTeam Qihoo  Content of type "text/html" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
