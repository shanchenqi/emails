Would be much appreciated.  This is on my back burner.  I might approach experimenting with this some months later.  I'm afraid I have other priorities right now.  For now, I recommend that you don't use DMARC for addresses that you use on mailing lists (posting and/or subscribing); in fact, I am likely to continue to recommend this even if we do deploy a workaround for the lists hosted at Openwall.
