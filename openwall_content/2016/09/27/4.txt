This will result in passing a very large 'size_t len' (ep - p) parameter for memmove().  Could you assign a CVE for this?  --  Regards, Reno Robert http://v0ids3curity.blogspot.in/  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
