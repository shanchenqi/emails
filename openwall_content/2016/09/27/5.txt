I was able to reproduce this issue with the  ImageMagick provided by my Ubuntu system  The problem is that a file name ending with a colon (':') causes the  program to hang forever.  If an attacker is able to have some control  over the input file name, then this could be used to cause DOS by  hanging the program.  The following is the text from the problem report:     commented 4 days ago â˘ edited    Version: ImageMagick Q16    http://www.imagemagick.org    Copyright: Copyright (C) ImageMagick Studio LLC    License: http://www.imagemagick.org/script/license.php    Features: Cipher DPC OpenMP    Delegates (built-in): jng jpeg lzma png tiff xml zlib     OS: (amazon linux)     identify hangs on the following commands:     identify "d:" (no output, just hangs forever)    identify "d::" (no output, just hangs forever)    identify "http:"    error : Unknown IO error (hangs after this message)    identify "http::"    error : Unknown IO error (hangs after this message)  >From my own investigations, I used     identify -debug all "d:"  and see that a temporary file is reported to be created and then the  program hangs which no apparent CPU usage.
