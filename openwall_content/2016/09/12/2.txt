Hi  The nfs-ganesha (userspace nfsd) offers a dbus API to control/admin the nfsd via cmdline tools and some qt+python code.  The default dbus config seems to allow anyone to connect to it and invoke methods. The code at least does not check any polkit authorizations or dbus sender (at a first look). Am I missing something? If I dont, the DBUS API should be declared experimental and disabled by default, since there are some methods which would allow users to gain root.  https://github.com/nfs-ganesha/nfs-ganesha/ https://github.com/nfs-ganesha/nfs-ganesha/wiki/Dbusinterface  Sebastian  --   ~ perl self.pl ~ ~ krahmer@...e.com - SuSE Security Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
