This advisory focuses on a critical vulnerability with a CVEID of The vulnerability affects MySQL servers in all version branches (5.7, 5.6, and 5.5) including the latest versions, and could be exploited by both local and remote attackers. Both the authenticated access to MySQL database (via network connection or web interfaces such as phpMyAdmin) and SQL Injection could be used as exploitation vectors.  Successful exploitation could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code with root privileges which would then allow them to fully compromise the server on which an affected version of MySQL is running.  This advisory provides a (limited) Proof-Of-Concept MySQL exploit which demonstrates how Remote Root Code Execution could be achieved by attackers. Full PoC (which works on default installations without the need for the attacker to find writable config files) will be provided later on to give users a chance to react to this advisory as the issue has not been patched by all the affected vendors yet despite efforts.  The exploitation is interesting in the way that it involves an oldschool LD_PRELOAD environment variable and that it targets a service that doesn't serve requests as root but could still be tricked to get root RCE when restarted. Might give you strange feelings when restarting mysql service the next time ;)  The advisory is available at:    --  Regards, Dawid Golunski http://legalhackers.com  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
