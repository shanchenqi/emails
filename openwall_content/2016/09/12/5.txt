Thanks for the feedback. I actually updated the introduction after your email. The advisory focuses on vulnerability which lets users to modify/create my.cnf files. A fix would prevent users from writing to my.cnf config.  And yes there's a typo in the last paragraph made after a few sleepless nights ;) I've fixed it now.  The is not public yet. I refer to it in the advisory to give some heads up in case someone wanted to discard this issue based on reasoning that FILE privs are not common and that they will never be pwned etc. It'll soon be published then it'll be clear what this CVEID is about ;)  Cheers.
