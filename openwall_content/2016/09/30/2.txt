Roughly speaking, the proper constraints on <reponame> will be simpler than the proper constraints on <repourl>. We do not feel it is sensible to break this down further (e.g., what specific validation rules are required by not yet implemented) because the validation strategy is still being discussed in  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =2FzE -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
