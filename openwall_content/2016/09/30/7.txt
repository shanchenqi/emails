I have not found a CVE request for it, so here is one :  If a corosync node is connected to a pacemaker_remote node, the connection can be trivially killed simply by connecting to the remote on its standard TCP port (typically     error: Unexpected pacemaker_remote client takeover. Disconnecting  Takeover is allowed in order to support migration of the remote primitive from one corosync node to another, but since this is a trivial denial of service attack, it should only be allowed once a valid authkey is provided.  The flaw has been fixed in  => Upstream bug :  - Bug - DoS: valid authkey should be required for takeover of a Pacemaker remote  => Upstream fix :  - Fix: remote: - Notify other clients of a new connection only if the handshake has completed  Thanks!  --  Cedric Buissart, Product Security   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
