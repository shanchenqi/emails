Vulnerability: /htsrv/call_plugin.php #lines ``` param( 'params', 'string', null ); // serialized if( is_null($params) ) { // Default: $params = array(); } else { // params given. This may result in "false", but this means that unserializing failed. $params = @unserialize($params); //object injection } ``` The parameter of "params" may lead to Object Injection by sending "params=serialized+object+here" fixed:  This issue was reported by Peng Hua of silence.com.cn Inc. and I would like to request CVE for this issue (if not done so).  -------------------http://www.silence.com.cn/ penghua@...ence.com.cn PKAV Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
