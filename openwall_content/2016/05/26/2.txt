Use for both of these installation scenarios. As far as we can tell, the second scenario ("without publicly available") occurs only because TYPO3 Core code (or a copy of TYPO3 Core code) exists in, or is reachable by, a (supported or unsupported) backend module.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =A6Qx -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
