Issue Description ================= While conducting an internal evaluation of the software, LSE Leading Security Experts GmbH discovered a path traversal vulnerability in the product downloads function. A user with permissions to change or add products may change the Downloads name to a local file (e.g. "../../../config.inc.php"). This may lead to a privilege escalation.     Temporary Workaround and Fix ============================ Install latest update See   Proof of Concept ================ Create a new product in the backend. In the "Downloads" tab set "name of the uploaded file" to "../../../config.inc.php". Go to the frontend and buy the related product. Move to "My account" and choose the download section. Download the file and enjoy full database credentials.
