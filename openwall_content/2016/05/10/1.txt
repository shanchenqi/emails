Vulnerability details:  The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that causes the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the intended directory.  Risk:  The attacker is able to read the contents of files and expose sensitive data. If the targeted file is used for a security mechanism, then the attacker is able to bypass that mechanism.  Affected code:  ./nelio-ab-testing/includes/admin/admin-controller.php                 public function generate_html_content() {                         if ( isset( $_POST['filename'] ) && isset( $_POST['classname'] ) ) {                                 $file  = $_POST['filename'];                                 $class = $_POST['classname'];                                 require_once( $file );                                 call_user_func( array ( $class, 'generate_html_content' ) );                         }                 }  Notes:  Authentication required.
