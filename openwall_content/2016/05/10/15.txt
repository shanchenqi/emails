Assuming I got this right, the following commits fixed the issue.  >> They affect the following functions: > >> * rsvg_cairo_pop_discrete_layer - rsvg_cairo_pop_render_stack - >> rsvg_cairo_generate_mask: reproducible using circular-1.svg > > Use  Fixed in:  commit Author: Benjamin Otte <otte@...hat.com> Date:   Wed Oct 7      rsvg: Add rsvg_acquire_node()          This function does proper recursion checks when looking up resources     from URLs and thereby helps avoiding infinite loops when cyclic     references span multiple types of elements.   >> * _rsvg_css_normalize_font_size: reproducible using circular-2.svg > > Use  Fixed in:  commit Author: Benjamin Otte <otte@...hat.com> Date:   Wed Oct 7      state: Store mask as reference          Instead of immediately looking up the mask, store the reference and look     it up on use.   This fix is two commits before the other commit. --  Brian May <brian@...uxpenguins.xyz> https://linuxpenguins.xyz/brian/  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
