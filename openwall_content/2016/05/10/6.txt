Then I did a git clone, and grep /tmp and pointed on internal  IRC that, as usual, there is a ton of /tmp issue (and then Kurt did see and asked where I did see it, and answered on HN (to the question "bk is now opensource").   > BitKeeper is under Apache license so here it is. >  > Also a quick look at the source shows a ton of other potential /tmp/ vulns, > CC'ing bitkeeper security  for example:   There is also a few here: https://github.com/bitkeeper-scm/bitkeeper/blob/master/src/utils/extractor.c  but that's the installation script, so unlikely to be exploitable.
