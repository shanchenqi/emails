They do know about periodic application of security updates.  Regarding the comments from Kurt Seifried about the supposed perils of  MVG:  Unless ImageMagick is configured to use RSVG (as it often is), then it  will use its own built in SVG renderer by default (the built in one is  still available with a "MSVG:" prefix to the filename or possibly the  file extension).  The SVG renderer operates by translating the SVG  into MVG, including the URLs.  The translation is not secure in that  arbitrary MVG may be injected via SVG through text strings.  SVG is a  common file exchange format found on the web and often opened outside  of web browsers.  > * many of the upstream fixes in ImageMagick (and GraphicsMagick) >  are really just mitigations too, and they remove features that someone >  could conceivably have been using, which rather goes against the idea >  of a stable release with a fixed feature-set  Agreed.  > Bob, if you would like distributions to pick up GraphicsMagick security > fixes in a timely way, it would probably be really useful to do an > upstream release - distributions are typically a lot more confident about  I do plan to make a release, but want to make sure that the release is  of no less quality than other releases.  I want to remove the current  render/MVG "mitigation" regarding magick-specific syntax and provide a  "safer" operating mode which protects against magick-specific syntax  when it is used for formats with expected behavior like SVG.  The  "safer" mode may have general purpose value outside of MVG.
