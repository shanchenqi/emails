I spent quite a bit of time looking at the ImageMagick, GraphicsMagick, RedHat and Debian changes trying to piece together a proper list of flaws to fix through backporting and policy file changes.  I also spent some time looking at the remaining delegates trying to figure out which will have near-identical flaws to the issues that have already been fixed.  This is the list I'm working off of. For RedHat and Debian, I only checked the ImageMagick updates.  - RCE via shell characters in delegate invocation.

It's trivial to generate SSRF payloads for the formats processed through html2ps and soffice. I'd also expect that SSRF is normal behavior for uniconvertor, and RCE is normal behavior for blender and povray, but I haven't verified.  If those are all counted separately...
