The problem basically is unchecked return value from malloc inside the realloc function. So when "crafted" packets are sent to the server, realloc is triggered to extend the size of the data structure which holds the network data. Under memory pressure malloc could fail, which will trigger a null pointer deref.    > Finally, although perhaps not related to the issue of whether a CVE ID > should exist, that Security.html page says "If you find a security > hole in OpenSLP, please bring it to the attention of the OpenSLP > maintainer" and names John Calcote.
