That is good to hear.  OS distribution response seems to be good for software like ISC named  and OpenSSH but seems to be very poor for this trivial shell-exploit  issue which impacts a great many (perhaps more than a million) Linux,  *BSD, Solaris, and OS-X users.  Perhaps this is because the developers  of such packages are used to providing advance notice and a  well-formed response and distribution maintainers are practiced and  ready.  Most people using a graphical desktop (e.g Gnome and KDE) are exposed  to the issue since ImageMagick (and often GraphicsMagick) is a common  dependency and clicking on a file in a graphical file manager (or  delivered as an email attachment) is likely to expose the user to the  problem.  Servers processing uploaded images are exposed to the issue  but server applications often take additional precautions which might  protect from the problem.  Desktop users are entirely exposed.
