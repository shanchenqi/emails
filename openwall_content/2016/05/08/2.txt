This uncovered a number of issues in dosfstools / fsck.fat that have now been fixed in the new version 4.0. All issues were found with american fuzzy lop and address sanitizer.  https://github.com/dosfstools/dosfstools/issues/11 Global out of bounds read file_stat() / check_dir() Git commit / fix  https://github.com/dosfstools/dosfstools/issues/12 Unclear invalid memory access in get_fat() Git commit / fix  https://github.com/dosfstools/dosfstools/issues/25 Heap overflow in read_fat() https://github.com/dosfstools/dosfstools/issues/26 Heap out of bounds read in get_fat() Git commit / fix for both issues  These bugs can pose a security risk if a system automatically checks attached storage media with fsck or in situations where filesystems on untrusted devices get checked. The new version dosfstools 4.0 fixes all four bugs.   --  Hanno Bรถck https://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
