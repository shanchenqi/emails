The Jetty path normalization mechanism suffers of an implementation issue when parsing the request URLs.   The path normalization logic implemented in the PathResource class and introduced in Jetty versions 9.3.x can be defeated by requesting malicious URLs containing specific escaped characters.  Leveraging on this weakness, a malicious user can gain access to protected resources (e.g. WEB-INF and META-INF folders and their contents) and defeat application filters or other security constraints implemented in the servlet configuration.  A workaround to mitigate the issue, using the 'rewrite' module, can alternatively be implemented as follows:    $ java -jar ../start.jar --module=rewrite etc/backslashalias.xml  or     $ java -jar ../start.jar --add-to-startd=rewrite   $ java -jar ../start.jar  etc/backslashalias.xml   Workaround file backslashalias.xml contents:    <?xml version="1.0"?>   <!DOCTYPE Configure PUBLIC "-//Jetty//Configure//EN" "http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/configure_9_3.dtd">   <Configure id="Rewrite" class="org.eclipse.jetty.rewrite.handler.RuleContainer">     <Call name="addRule">       <Arg>         <New class="org.eclipse.jetty.rewrite.handler.RedirectRegexRule">           <Arg>.*\\.*</Arg>           <Arg>/</Arg>           <Set         </New>       </Arg>     </Call>   </Configure>   Affected version:  Jetty >= <=  Fixed version:  Jetty >=  Credit: vulnerability reported by Simon Zuckerbraun of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative  CVE:  Timeline:  vulnerability report received contacted maintainer patch provided by maintainer assigned CVE reporter confirms patch contacted affected vendors advisory release  References: http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/download.html  Permalink:  --   Daniele Bianco      Open Source Computer Security Incident Response Team   <danbia@...rt.org>                                  http://www.ocert.org    GPG Key   GPG Key fingerprint = F28F 1B9D 6F2D  4AC5 AE75  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
