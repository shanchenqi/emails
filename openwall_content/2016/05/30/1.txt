If there was a previous announcement of a vulnerability fix for a subset of the exploitation methodologies, then a separate CVE ID is also needed. The scope of is only the new "initial | character" information announced in the post.  (For example, if there had previously been any type of announcement that the    xlink:href="|  substring was being blocked in the native SVG readers, then that can have its own unique CVE ID.)  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  iOspq5Qmc+dxTuYQguTz =7jWy -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
