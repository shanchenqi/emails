Privilege escalation ===================================  The vulnerability that allowed logged-in users to edit or delete open pull requests associated with any repository to which they had read access, plus a related vulnerability allowing logged-in users to delete any comment from any repository, provided they could determine the comment ID and had read access to just one repository.  CSRF protection bypass =====================================  Routes allows GET requests to override the HTTP method, which breaks the Kallithea CSRF protection (which only applies to POST requests).  The attacker might misuse GET requests method overriding to trick user into issuing a request with a different method, thus bypassing the CSRF protection.  Resolution ==========  SĂ¸ren LĂ¸vborg wrote patches fixing these issues, both of which are included in the release Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.  --  Cheers,   Andrew    Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
