It could occur while accessing processor's  MTRRs via ioctl(2) calls.  A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to manipulate host kernel's  memory bytes leading to information disclosure OR potentially crashing the  kernel resulting in DoS.  has been assigned to this issue by Red Hat Inc.
