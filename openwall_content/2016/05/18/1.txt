Basically return value from malloc isnt checked, in _xrealloc function. This can be triggered remotely by sending a large number of request, which could possibly lead malloc to fail at one point, causing crash via null pointer deref.  Because of the way memory works on modern linux systems, this one seems to be difficult to exploit, so i am wondering if a CVE id should really be assigned to this issue.
