Is the issue somewhat similar to i.e., the attacker only needs the ability to mount an isofs filesystem on an already-running system -- either with physical removable media or equivalent actions that may be relevant with virtualization -- and then the attacker obtains the ability to read from some unintended (but not arbitrary) kernel memory locations? Also, is the severity of much greater than that of because the amount of kernel memory is much larger and because affects essentially every Linux release (as long as was used)?  Are there also plausible scenarios with a DoS impact, but they are of less concern because the information leak is much more important in almost all realistic cases? (For example: possibly someone has a long-running root process that tries to maintain a searchable index of all files on all user-mounted isofs filesystems, and that process stops because the code sees invalid readdir results.)  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  B4RwERTwoQgfX9GKwUnl =1bfz -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
