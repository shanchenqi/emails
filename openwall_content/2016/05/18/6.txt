Use  >  The oss-security message and the rhbz document seem to describe the impact in different ways, i.e., "Basically return value from malloc isn't checked ... This can be triggered remotely by sending a large number of requests, which could possibly lead malloc to fail at one point, causing crash via null pointer deref" versus "A remote attacker could potentially deplete the memory of the server." For purposes of CVE, this type of scenario is often not interpreted as two independent problems. Roughly speaking, it is interpreted as "The unchecked malloc return value is the primary problem. This problem becomes reachable for reasons that aren't fully described, but those reasons might involve a design limitation in which the memory consumption of requests is not strictly controlled."  http://www.openslp.org/doc/html/UsersGuide/Security.html says "The OpenSLP daemon (slpd) must run as root initially in order to bind to the well known SLP port. However, slpd will relinquish root privileges and suid() to the daemon user (if it exists)." Thus, maybe the affected code is running as root with large or unbounded resource limits in some situations.  > Because of the way memory works on modern linux systems, this one seems > to be difficult to exploit  Maybe there is a relevant non-Linux case? http://www.openslp.org/doc/html/faq.html says "the OpenSLP code has proven to be very portable. It currently works on many operating systems including: Linux, BSD, Solaris, Tru64, HPUX, UnixWare, OSR5, and Win32."  Finally, although perhaps not related to the issue of whether a CVE ID should exist, that Security.html page says "If you find a security hole in OpenSLP, please bring it to the attention of the OpenSLP maintainer" and names John Calcote. Possibly Red Hat could do this upstream notification if that hasn't already happened.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  cqBtWstYfr4XjyyVazC1 =/rdk -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
