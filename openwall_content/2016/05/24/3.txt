While the above directory is KB under tar.xz, the PoC attached to Red Hat Bugzilla Bug is KB under xz.  So let's keep just the vulnerability detail in here for now.  One of the reasons why I am posting this is to provide an example of what content to include in oss-security postings going forward.  Also, it's a call for smaller PoCs (for further occasions; no need to rework these PoCs now), so that those could be included as well.
