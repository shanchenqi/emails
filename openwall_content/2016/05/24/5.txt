Berrange" <berrange@...hat.com> Subject: libvirt: DoS via excessive logging      Hello,  A while back, Mr Andrew Sorensen reported a Qemu logging issue wherein Libvirt  OR Xen directed 'stderr' of Qemu to a log file on the host.  This can be easily exploited by a user inside guest to flood the log file with  endless messages, resulting in a DoS situation on the host, affecting other  services and guests alike.  was assigned to it by Red Hat Inc.  Until recently there was no remedy in sight, but quoting Mr Daniel P Berrange  of libvirt     "Since libvirt version libvirt has 'virtlogd' daemon running. The     QEMU stdout/err are no longer connected directly to a file on disk, instead     they go to a pipe connected to virtlogd. virtlogd only allows kb of     data to be written before rolling over the logs, and only keeps 3 backups,     so there is no longer an uncontrolled denial of service.      With QEMU 2.6, it is further possible to use virtlogd in association with     QEMU serial ports that need to log to a file, for the same reason."  Upstream patch: ---------------    ->  Note: It's probably not feasible to back port this solution to older versions.
