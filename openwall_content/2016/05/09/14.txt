As a workaround, I would suggest that systems which do not require (userspace) RDMA/Infiniband to blacklist/remove the following modules:    rdma_ucm   ib_uverbs   ib_ucm   ib_umad  For example, adds the following in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf    blacklist rdma_ucm   blacklist ib_uverbs   blacklist ib_ucm   blacklist ib_umad  Those building their own kernel might want to disable, if not already,    CONFIG_INFINIBAND_USER_ACCESS,    CONFIG_INFINIBAND_USER_MAD,   CONFIG_INFINIBAND_ADDR_TRANS  (Unfortunately the last one will also disable those features:   iSCSI Extensions for RDMA (iSER)   iSCSI Extensions for RDMA (iSER) target support   RDS over Infiniband and iWARP   9P RDMA Transport (Experimental)   RPC-over-RDMA transport     (which actually disable NFSoRDMA))  Regards.  --  Yann Droneaud OPTEYA   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
