In GraphicsMagick, defining the environment variable  MAGICK_CODER_STABILITY=PRIMARY before running the will block out quite  a lot of functionality (including SVG/MVG/MSL) but nothing can be  considered entirely safe.  > I think the reason people are surprised and concerned to read about the > MVG and MSL scripting languages is that they enter *Magick through the > same APIs that open "safe" image files, blurring the boundary between > "open a file" and "execute a script".

It is likely that the *Magick name was coined from the header of XPM  files which playfully use the word "magick" as part of the header that  programs would use for header magic testing.  This sets the stage for  the automatic things that the software is doing.  In GraphicsMagick, the automatic scary stuff is all done within one  function so it is reasonable to develop a less magical mode which is  less likely to dispatch to a file reader for an archaic file format  which stopped being used in  Bob --  Bob Friesenhahn bfriesen@...ple.dallas.tx.us, http://www.simplesystems.org/users/bfriesen/ GraphicsMagick Maintainer,    http://www.GraphicsMagick.org/  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
