I suspect that many ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick users are in an analogous situation.

Is there an API that can be used to say "load this arbitrary file, but only if it is in a format that is considered entirely safe"? (Safe in the sense that it isn't vulnerable to SSRF, doesn't perform arbitrary actions like MSL does, can't recurse into a separate resource that might not be safe, and so on, in a way that won't become insecure by the addition of another format.)  At the moment my mitigation for these vulnerabilities is refusing to resize images that don't end with .jpg .jpeg .png or .gif, refusing to resize images that have one of those extensions but don't have the matching magic number, and invoking ImageMagick APIs with an argument like "jpeg:myfile.jpg" to force the use of the expected coder. This doesn't seem like something that every developer is going to get right in practice.  > > >     MSL is an XML-based "script" > > >     format which should never be allowed to be submitted and invoked > > >     by an untrusted party. > >  > > Is there any situation where GraphicsMagick will interpret a file of > > unspecified format as MSL, for instance recognizing it by extension or > > magic number? >  > There is no detection of MSL by its header but the MSL reader will be > dispatched to by a .MSL extension.

I think it might be necessary to add that one line of code, if rendering a SVG that contains <xi:include> directives can result in interpreting an accompanying .msl script. On the other hand, if SVGs are open to SSRF by design, many services will need to avoid processing an attacker-supplied SVG anyway, so perhaps the set of services that are willing to process SVGs from untrusted users is negligible...  > The focus of https://imagetragick.com/ on MVG has brought attention to it, > and tarnished its reputation, but (provided it is not executed by default) > the focus should be on assuring that formats assumed to be secure (e.g. SVG > and WMF) are read/rendered securely.  I think the reason people are surprised and concerned to read about the MVG and MSL scripting languages is that they enter *Magick through the same APIs that open "safe" image files, blurring the boundary between "open a file" and "execute a script". If the entry point into executing MVG/MSL scripts was named more like ExecuteScript(), as opposed to ReadImage(), then I don't think anyone would object to MVG and MSL files having arbitrary code execution capabilities.  It's the same concern as when office suites' document formats gain support for auto-running macros when opened, or when operating systems start auto-running scripts and executables when removable media are inserted - an action that was previously considered to be mostly safe to perform on untrusted content unexpectedly becomes an act of trust.
