While GraphicsMagick  does escape individual Unix shell arguments appropriately, the gnuplot  load request can be used to invoke gnuplot's system() command.  The  mere existence of a system() command makes gnuplot files entirely  unsecure and it is a very dangerous format.  Unfortunately, I see that SourceForge converted the several patches  into MS-DOS format.
