I think this should perhaps have a separate CVE ID assigned: it's the same impact (arbitrary code execution) and was discovered at around the same time, but the mechanism is not similar to the missing/insufficient quoting/escaping for ImageMagick's %M placeholder, which was the root cause of (the original incarnation of)  In GraphicsMagick this was the "GPLT" format, removed in hg commit "Gnuplot files are inherently insecure. Remove delegates support for reading them."  In ImageMagick this was the "PLT" format, removed in this git commit with the misleading commit message "Update to the latest autoconf/automake":  MITRE, do you consider this to be:  * part of * a single separate vulnerability to which both GraphicsMagick and ImageMagick   were vulnerable, or * two separate vulnerabilities, one in each package?  > 2. - SSRF >  >    GraphicsMagick has always supported HTTP and FTP URL requests from >    the context of the executing process if it is linked with libxml2. >    There is no sandboxing or policy to determine which HTTP and FTP >    URLs should be allowed/denied because they should only be available >    from outside the system, or in the public space outside >    a "firewall".  I'm not sure whether I'm understanding "because they should..." correctly.  To be clear, are you saying that running GraphicsMagick code on a host that is whitelisted in someone's IP address ACL, has access to a LAN where the wider Internet does not, or has private services on the loopback interface is not a supported situation?  Is there a subset of "safe" image formats that is known not to induce these requests, and where they *would* be considered to be a bug?  I would be surprised if this happened when resizing or manipulating common bitmap formats like JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, and one of the mitigations recommended on imagetragick.com has been to limit the formats that will be accepted.  > 4. - File moving >  >     This is a two-factor attack and is actually file copying.

Is there any situation where GraphicsMagick will interpret a file of unspecified format as MSL, for instance recognizing it by extension or magic number?
