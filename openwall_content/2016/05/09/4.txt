Qemu VGA module allows guest to edit certain registers in 'vbe' and 'vga'  modes. ie. guest could set certain 'VGA' registers while in 'VBE' mode. This  leads to potential integer overflow or OOB read access issues in Qemu,  resulting in DoS by crashing the Qemu process on the host. (Moderate)  A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process on the  host.  has been assigned to this issue by Red Hat Inc. Patches are  attached herein to help fix this issue.  This issue was discovered and reported by Zuozhi Fzz of Alibaba Inc.
