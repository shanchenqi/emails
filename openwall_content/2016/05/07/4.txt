The number of planes is specific to a buffer, not to the queue. >      >     This does lead to the situation where multi-plane buffers may be requested >     and queued with n planes, but VIDIOC_DQBUF IOCTL may be passed an argument >     struct with fewer planes. >      >     __fill_v4l2_buffer() however uses the number of planes from the dequeued >     videobuf2 buffer, overwriting kernel memory (the m.planes array allocated >     in video_usercopy() in v4l2-ioctl.c)  if the user provided fewer >     planes than the dequeued buffer had. Oops! >      >     Fixes: ("[media] media: videobuf2: Prepare to divide videobuf2")  Fixed in (Cc'ed to stable@...r.kernel.org for v4.4+, fixed in and  Introduced by  Regards, Salvatore  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
