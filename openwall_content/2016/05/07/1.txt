It has been fixed in with commit   > IB/security: Restrict use of the write() interface > The drivers/infiniband stack uses write() as a replacement for > bi-directional ioctl().  This is not safe. There are ways to > trigger write calls that result in the return structure that > is normally written to user space being shunted off to user > specified kernel memory instead. >  > For the immediate repair, detect and deny suspicious accesses to > the write API. >  > For long term, update the user space libraries and the kernel API > to something that doesn't present the same security vulnerabilities > (likely a structured ioctl() interface). >  > The impacted uAPI interfaces are generally only available if > hardware from drivers/infiniband is installed in the system.  Could you assign a CVE for this issue?  I'm just to avoid possible duplication as well Cc'ing Red Hat's secalert, since the commit was signed off by Doug Ledford <dledford@...hat.com>.
