As far as we can tell, this statement does not imply that there is a remaining known vulnerability after - instead, this statement only suggests a possible functionality problem, e.g., there might be third-party code or in-development code that was attempting to rely on write calls for a legitimate purpose, and this code has now stopped working without an immediate workaround.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  LY6zu+JLlIGbCDdCOL/o =Zjzu -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
