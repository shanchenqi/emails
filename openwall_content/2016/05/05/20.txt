I've took a look.  moduli are divisible by All of them consist of duplicated  32-bit limbs, as we have already seen in previous examples. There are no  exponents in the set, so I've only checked moduli.  moduli are both in this set and in the phuctor set. There are 11  moduli that are in phuctor only:   > I'll upload a keyids file to the pgpmoduli repo: > https://github.com/hannob/pgpmoduli > > The way to interpret that data is that line numbers match.
