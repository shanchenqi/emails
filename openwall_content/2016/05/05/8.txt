Are you sure?  Got an example?  I think the fingerprint was always a hash, with key id being last 32+ bits from it.  I think it is compatible with PGP 2.x's from  Did I possibly miss some very early versions of GPG where this was not true, transitioning from PGP 2.x to later GPG (which I did) and thus not noticing this aspect?  (Just trying to see how your statement could possibly be correct and consistent with my experience using PGP/GPG.)
