Our reply at that time was:    >    >> Since n is a signed int, n wraps over at some iteration. Since,   >> realloc expects n to be unsigned, we end up allocating less memory   >> then actually needed. In the beginning though n is too large and   >> xrealloc simply complains. However, if you play a bit with the length   >> of arg, you'll quickly turn that integer overflow in a buffer   >> overflow.    Use for this incorrect handling of a signed int.   > 2) Invalid Write due to a Use-After-Free (Fixed in GCC trunk) >  Comment 2 says "two distinct bugs."  Use for the btypevec bug.  Use for the ktypevec bug.   > 3) Invalid Write due to Integer Overflow (Fixed in GCC trunk) >  Use   > 4) Write Access Violation (Fixed in GCC trunk) >  Use for this issue described as "Root cause: In cp-demangle.c sometimes length-variables are of type long ... Other times they are of type int."  Note that this CVE ID is not about the Comment 1 "case where consume_count returns -1" -- that comment does not belong in at all.   > 5) Various Stack Corruptions (Patch under Review) > >  Use for this issue caused by a lack of checking for "has itself as ancestor more than once."   > 6) Write Access Violation (Patch under Review) > >  Use for both of the "first read the value of a length variable len from the mangled string, then strncpy len characters from the mangled string; more than necessary" issues.  Use for both of the "read the value of an array index n from the mangled string, which can be negative due to an overflow" issues.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  kazRhIrShTety5Dx7/qO =Qvdr -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
