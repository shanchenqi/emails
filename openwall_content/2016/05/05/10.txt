I guess when I imported a PGP 2.6 key to GPG, I just did not notice this detail, and GPG continued to use the V3 format key for me.  Also from the RFC above:  "  For a V3 key, the eight-octet Key ID consists of the low 64 bits of    the public modulus of the RSA key.     The fingerprint of a V3 key is formed by hashing the body (but not    the two-octet length) of the MPIs that form the key material (public    modulus n, followed by exponent e) with MD5.  Note that both V3 keys    and MD5 are deprecated."  So key id was not part of the fingerprint.  That's not how I remember it, but I'll trust the RFC over my memory.
