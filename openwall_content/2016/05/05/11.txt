Even if these keys had valid self-signatures, that wouldn't imply anything about whether they were generated by the people or organizations named in the uids; anyone could generate a PGP key right now that claimed to be yours or mine or anyone else's. That's why we have the "web of trust", along with competing identity-claiming mechanisms like keybase.io - the generated key wouldn't have (reputable) third-party signatures, unless its generator was able to do some social engineering to obtain them.  I would have expected that an attacker trying for things like evil32 would want to have a valid self-signature, and the self-signature isn't magic (it's just an ordinary signature made with the private certification key as far as I know), so I'm a bit confused by why these "mirrored" keys would lack them?
