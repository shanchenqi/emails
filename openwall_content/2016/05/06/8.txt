It has been fixed with the following commit:   > Subject: [PATCH] HTML-escape error messages >  > The instance in cgierror() is a potential cross-site scripting attack, > because an attacker could conceivably cause some module to raise an > exception that includes attacker-supplied HTML in its message, for > example via a crafted filename. >  > The instances in preprocess() is just correctness. It is not a > cross-site scripting attack, because an attacker could equally well > write the desired HTML themselves; the sanitize hook is what > protects us from cross-site scripting here.  Could you please assign a CVE identifier for this issue.
