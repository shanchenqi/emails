The kernel/bpf/verifier.c attack surface for unprivileged users is also relevant to one or more previous CVEs such as Also, the paragraphs after "There are two problems with this approach" describe kernel behaviors that make exploitation more reliable. We do not currently feel that these behaviors should have CVE IDs. For example, the paragraphs mention "abusing the writev() syscall and FUSE" and "has to wait for the attacker-owned FUSE filesystem to resolve the pagefault, allowing the attacker to suspend code execution in the kernel at that point arbitrarily.")   > bpf: fix refcnt overflow: >  Use  (The "program refcnt" and "map refcnt" problems are not precisely analogous but we feel that the one ID, is sufficient.)   > bpf: fix check_map_func_compatibility logic > >  > Not sure though if the later one has a security impact.  We have not yet assigned a CVE ID to in case someone else wants to provide additional information.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  osmgYu9VbVVb8mMPATPw =V36N -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
