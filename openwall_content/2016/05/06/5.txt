Use for the vulnerability in client_side_request.cc - here, "if (aConn)" was added.  Use for the vulnerability in Esi.cc - it is described as "was being unlocked without having been locked."   > Due to unrelated changes Squid-3.5 has become vulnerable to some > regular ESI server responses also triggering one or more of these > issues. >  > This bug is fixed by Squid version and  As far as we can tell, this does not really mean that there is an additional vulnerability in that did not exist in Instead, it means that the vulnerabilities are the same, but in 3.5.x people might notice the vulnerabilities being exploited accidentally.   > (URLs below are now all public, but some of our mirrors may take a few > more hours to pick up the changes).  This means, for example, that the URLs work if one manually locates all instances of www.squid-cache.org and inserts www1.jp.squid-cache.org instead.
