Details:   Fixed via:  And as well reported/forwarded in Debian:  Could you please assign a CVE for this issue?  The following two might as well warrant a CVE (Ben Hutchings CC'ed has already applied those to the packaging repository in Debian):  bpf: fix refcnt overflow:  bpf: fix check_map_func_compatibility logic  Not sure though if the later one has a security impact. The bug allowed generic map functions to be applied to special map types (program, perf events) that did not support them properly.
