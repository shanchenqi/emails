Hi,  as you can see here:  http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/graphicsmagick  GM in Ubuntu resides in the "universe" repository  When you read up about "universe" here:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu  you will see that:  "Universe - Community maintained software, i.e. not officially supported software."  which means all software from universe is _not_ officially supported by canonical and thus receives only timely updates, if a community member picks up the necessary work.  Too also quote from https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS  "The LTS designation applies only to specific subsets of the Ubuntu archive."  See also this (german) article about packages which do not get security updates in Ubuntu "LTS" releases, because they are only community maintained:   There is also a command line tool to find out about unsupported packages:  ubuntu-support-status --show-unsupported   HTH  --  Mit freundlichen Grüßen / Regards  Sven Kieske  Systemadministrator Mittwald CM Service GmbH & Co.
