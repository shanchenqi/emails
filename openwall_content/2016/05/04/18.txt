This bug may result in leaks of sensitive kernel stack data.  The patch of this bug has been accepted by Linux kernel maintainer and will be merged in the next kernel release (see the message bellow).  Fix info: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/staging.git  Could you please assign a CVE to it?  Thanks, Kangjie Lu   ---------- Forwarded message ---------- From: <gregkh@...uxfoundation.org> Date: Wed, May 4, at AM Subject: patch "staging: fix infoleak in wilc_wfi_cfgoperations" added to staging-testing To: kangjielu@...il.com, gregkh@...uxfoundation.org, kjlu@...ech.edu    This is a note to let you know that I've just added the patch titled      staging: fix infoleak in wilc_wfi_cfgoperations  to my staging git tree which can be found at     git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/staging.git in the staging-testing branch.  The patch will show up in the next release of the linux-next tree (usually sometime within the next 24 hours during the week.)  The patch will be merged to the staging-next branch sometime soon, after it passes testing, and the merge window is open.  If you have any questions about this process, please let me know.   >From Mon Sep 17 From: Kangjie Lu <kangjielu@...il.com> Date: Tue, 3 May Subject: staging: fix infoleak in wilc_wfi_cfgoperations  "mac" is an array allocated in stack without being initialized, and will be sent out via "nla_put". The dump_station() is supposed to initialize the mac address; otherwise, sensitive data in kernel stack will be leaked. To fix this, copy the mac address to it.
