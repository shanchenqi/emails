From keys listed at http://phuctor.nosuchlabs.com/phuctored,  ones have modulus and exponent divisible by  $ curl -s http://phuctor.nosuchlabs.com/phuctored |  >   perl -Mbigint -ln0e 'print join " ", map { $_ % + 1) } ($1,  $2) while m{RSA Modulus .N.:.*?<td>(\d+)<.*?<td>(\d+)<}sg' |  >   grep -c '^0 0$'  Modulus and exponent are divisible by or not simultaneously.  --  Alexander Cherepanov  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
