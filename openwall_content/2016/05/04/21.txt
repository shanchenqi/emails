It is possible that nobody will use this ID for OpenSSL risk management, but someone will use this ID in deciding to pursue further research on "shifting more than the size of an expression" issues.)  If this ID is sent in an oss-security followup, the Subject: header should be changed to mention OpenSSL. Also, MITRE currently plans to publish the CVE for this along with the CVEs for the OpenSSL issues, which should be very soon.  - -- CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =yEbu -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----    --   -- Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
