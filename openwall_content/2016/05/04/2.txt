Its last 3 bytes are padding bytes which are not initialized and leaked to userland via “copy_to_user”.  The patch of this bug has been accepted by Linux kernel maintainer and will be merged in the next major kernel release (see the bellow message).  Fix info: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/usb.git  Could you please assign a CVE to it?  Thanks, Kangjie Lu     ---------- Forwarded message ---------- From: <gregkh@...uxfoundation.org> Date: Tue, May 3, at PM Subject: patch "USB: usbfs: fix potential infoleak in devio" added to usb-next To: kangjielu@...il.com, gregkh@...uxfoundation.org, kjlu@...ech.edu    This is a note to let you know that I've just added the patch titled      USB: usbfs: fix potential infoleak in devio  to my usb git tree which can be found at     git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/usb.git in the usb-next branch.
