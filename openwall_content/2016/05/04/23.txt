Sorry.  Not that it matters, but I was uncomfortable leaving the error uncorrected in case someone wants to try and figure out why exactly this artifact manifests itself like it does.  There's probably an explanation of why the algorithm is likely to hit numbers of this form, but this is beside the point for software bugs, which is what I want us to discuss further in this thread.
