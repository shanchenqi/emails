While the 32-bit duplication of e is probably for real (or those keys wouldn't validate... do they?), similar observations for factors are probably a red herring: an artifact of the process used by these factoring projects rather than part of how the keys were generated.  Specifically, the above 3-limb example came from this key:   Its listed factors for:   are:   However, this modulus is also divisible by 3, 5, and thus by 15, etc. So what we're seeing in databases like this are just some larger non-prime factors that combine the smaller factors in specific ways. I understand that's not how they were figured out (rather, they're shared factors with other keys), but that's what they happen to be composed of.  Moreover, the larger ones of the factors above are divisible by the smaller ones of them:  / = / =  So these are pretty much arbitrary, process-dependent combinations of smaller factors, and thus their bit patterns, etc. don't tell us much or anything about the nature of bugs in key generation, if there were any. (I say "if there were any" since the keys could as well have been mangled later.)  BTW, had I not realized the above, I would now come up with an even more complex conspiracy theory about which is so:  limb[0] = limb[1] = limb[2] = limb[3] = 1  which satisfies:  limb[1] = limb[0] + limb[2] + 2  No idea why it's "+ 2" here, unlike in the smaller factor's example, but like I say this is just a conspiracy theory, and I think the simple explanation is it's an artifact of the process rather than any inherent property of the keys.  Thus, I think it makes sense to focus on searching for bugs producing the 32-bit duplicated e's, after all.  And it also makes sense to validate those keys - not merely rely on data already in these factoring projects' databases.  Could it be that all of the broken e keys were generated by OpenSSL from year or earlier?  Embedded copies in proprietary PGP implementations that have since been rebuilt for 64-bit?  Doesn't sound very realistic, but who knows.  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
