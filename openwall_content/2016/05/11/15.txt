Users should upgrade to Jenkins 2.3 or Jenkins https://jenkins.io/download/  Summary and description of the vulnerabilities are below. Some more  details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you find security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  1) / Arbitrary build parameters are passed to  build scripts as environment variables  Build parameters in Jenkins typically are passed to build scripts as  environment variables. Some plugins allow passing arbitrary (undeclared) parameters. Depending on access permissions and installed plugins,  malicious users were able to trigger builds, passing arbitrary  environment variables (e.g. PATH) to modify the behavior of those builds.   2) / Malicious users with multiple user  accounts can prevent other users from logging in  By changing the freely editable 'full name', malicious users with multiple user accounts could prevent other users from logging in, as  'full name' was resolved before actual user name to determine which  account is currently trying to log in.   3) / Information on installed plugins exposed  via API  The XML/JSON API endpoints providing information about installed plugins were missing permissions checks, allowing any user with read access to Jenkins to determine which plugins and versions were installed.   4) / Encrypted secrets (e.g. passwords) were leaked to users with permission to read configuration  Users with extended read access could access encrypted secrets stored directly in the configuration of those items.   5) / Regular users can trigger download of update site metadata  A missing permissions check allowed any user with access to Jenkins  to trigger an update of update site metadata. This could be combined with DNS cache poisoning to disrupt Jenkins service.   6) / Open redirect to scheme-relative URLs  Some Jenkins URLs did not properly validate the redirect URLs, which allowed malicious users to create URLs that redirect users to arbitrary scheme-relative URLs.   7) / Granting the permission to read node configurations allows access to overall system configuration  The API URL /computer/(master)/api/xml allowed users with the 'extended read' permission for the master node to see some global Jenkins configuration, including the configuration of the security realm.
