They just have to set the id as API parameter.  Mitigation: make sure you have filters restricted to organizations or locations  when you limit user by assigning him particular organization or location.  Affects Foreman 1.7 and higher  Patch available at Fix released in Foreman (to be released) For more information please see Redmine issue   -- Marek    Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
