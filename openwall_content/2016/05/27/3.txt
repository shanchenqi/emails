The function DecodeAdpcmImaQT at allocates a buffer which is filled with bytes from the input stream. However, it does not check that the number of channels in the input stream is less than or equal to the size of the buffer, resulting in an out-of-bounds write. The number of channels is clamped at <= 5.  adpcm_ima_wav_channel_t channel[2]; ... for( i_ch = 0; i_ch < p_dec->fmt_in.audio.i_channels; i_ch++ ) {     channel[i_ch].i_predictor  = (int16_t)((( ( p_buffer[0] << 1 )|( p_buffer[1] >> 7 ) ))<<7);     channel[i_ch].i_step_index = ...  The mangling of the input p_buffer above and in AdpcmImaWavExpandNibble() makes this difficult to exploit, but there is a potential for remote code execution via a malicious media file.  Please find attached a POC which crashes VLC[1].  The vendor has confirmed the issue has been resolved and will be fixed in VLC and VLC  Please allocate a CVE for this issue. If you require any further information, please let me know.  Regards,  Patrick  1.
