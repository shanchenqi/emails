The overflows can manifest as a segmentation fault or as memory corruption during a parse operation. The bugs allow for a denial of service attack in many applications by an unauthenticated attacker, and could conceivably result in remote code execution.  Mitigation: Applications that are using Expat should apply the attached patch as soon as possible.
