It blocks many network related operations, including for example creation of new incoming ssh connections.  The problem is especially important for containers, container owner have enough permission to enable this trigger and then can block network access on whole host node.  The problem is fixed in net-next git by patch  From: David Miller <davem@...emloft.net> ipv4: Don't do expensive useless work during inetdev destroy.  When an inetdev is destroyed, every address assigned to the interface is removed.  And in this scenerio we do two pointless things which can be very expensive if the number of assigned interfaces is large:  1) Address promotion.  We are deleting all addresses, so there is no    point in doing this.  2) A full nf conntrack table purge for every address.  We only need to    do this once, as is already caught by the existing    masq_dev_notifier so masq_inet_event() can skip this.
