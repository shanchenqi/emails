Hi there,  I just noticed that cgit versions before contain a bug in the "txt2html" filter script:  It seems this is the mailing list thread in which the fix was posted (unfortunately, the attachment was dropped):  The release notes for mention the fix, but there seems to be no CVE for it:  This allows for an XSS attack by anyone with write access: If you can push to a git repository for which the "txt2html" converter is activate, you can create a README or README.txt and insert arbitrary HTML.  Please note that the recommended "about-formatting.sh" filter will also allow unfiltered HTML files, Markdown or ReST documents, so that's arguably by design.  But it's definitely a surprise for people like myself who would expect all files to be filtered for safe HTML like GitHub or Bitbucket do.  And of course, in cases where an administrator tries to add *restricted* README support by allowing only plaintext files through the txt2html filter, this would definitely be undesired.  Finally, the about-formatting.sh may be shipped by default, but the default value of the "about-filter" is empty, and it seems that the installation script does *not* supply a default configuration file which could override that, so it has to be explicitly enabled by the user (or the distro's package).  Anyway, all in all, I think this is probably worth a CVE because it's so non-obvious.
