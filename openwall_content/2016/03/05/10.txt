I expect that various existing vulnerability databases will start listing OVE IDs along with other IDs they're currently listing.  Whatever IDs are available for an issue.  Of course, the information will need to be available to those third-party databases from somewhere - but this can be the researcher's or the vendor's disclosure, as you say.  Until such disclosure, a customer would not even be aware of the ID, let alone want to look it up.  > * Invalid Entries - As noted, there's no way to see if a given ID is > considered valid, and while there is value to just having an ID, this > model makes later curation more difficult.

I think there is such opportunity, it's just possibly more difficult.  > Here is what I would like to see:  This sounds similar to what Tim wanted.  Feel free to implement that. I think if such a thing appears, there may still be interest in a bare-bones solution, which OVE currently is.  I have no current plans to expand OVE into a more complete solution.  > * Simple ID Request - Data required should be minimal, though I think > a few basic items are needed.

This is already a major concern with CVE, where information may be subject to unjustified risk for the purpose of merely getting an ID assigned.  OVE currently side-steps the issue.
