It's not that Mitre are not adding value, I can see the benefit of a carefully curated list. The problem is that they're a big bottleneck in what is an already painful process. I started the process of becoming a CNA once to try and alleviate some of the delays, but that process was even more painful and I gave up after a few months (this was a long time ago).  I'd only start using CVE identifiers again if they're assigned instantly, and the curation is non-blocking.  Tavis.
