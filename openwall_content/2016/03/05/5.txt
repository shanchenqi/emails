I stated OWASP.org in I am happy to put some skin in the game and setup a with the right open-source governance structure (read: for the right reasons) and financially bootstrap (build a site and pay for one dedicated full time employee for at least the first year) to get this off the ground. Not what will be needed long term but enough to  start the journey .....  Experience with OWASP was you need a few "mavens" so Kurt, Hanno and others would need to step up and be on a 'founders board' to make it successful etc but ..
