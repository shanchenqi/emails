We're going to approach this one in the same way as the issue that was later assigned  Specifically, is there anyone who believes must not have a CVE ID?  The situation, very roughly, seems to be that the upstream vendor has announced that the behavior is a bug. CLAC occurs at a correct place for some types of entries, but accidentally did not occur at a correct place in the case of entries through the int80 gate. Consequently, exploits of kernel vulnerabilities can cause more damage in some cases.  However, it seems to be a bug in how the kernel responds to a post-exploitation attack pattern. This is not a topic area that commonly has CVE ID assignments. Access by the kernel to a user space page is not an action that "crosses a privilege boundary" in a traditional sense.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =ADv/ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
