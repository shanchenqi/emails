Use for this issue.  Incidentally, there typically aren't CVE IDs for reports such as "MySQL clients have long had a --ssl option. Casual users may think specifying this option will cause clients to secure connections using SSL. That is not the case ... This behavior is clearly explained in the manual ... this option is not sufficient in itself to cause an SSL connection to be used" in the post. In other words, if the only problem were that the product documented behavior that hardly anyone wants, and omitted behavior that would be much more useful, then a CVE ID generally shouldn't exist. This case was different because, as mentioned in the https://duo.com/blog/backronym-mysql-vulnerability post, other documentation stated "MYSQL_OPT_SSL_VERIFY_SERVER_CERT ... This feature can be used to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks." This was misleading because enabling the certificate-verification code didn't prevent the man-in-the-middle attacker from using a cleartext-downgrade attack. Also, is arguably a vendor confirmation that the behavior was a MySQL vulnerability, even though it was not on an official vendor web site. was posted by the CNA for this CVE.  http://php.net/ChangeLog-5.php has the three vendor confirmations of (the entries that mention bug We don't know whether the unpatched mysqlnd.c code ever included misleading documentation about the relationship between certificate verification and man-in-the-middle protection, but that's not needed for a CVE because of the obvious confirmation on the vendor's official site.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =xHPT -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
