The question > is whether there is a way for the ext4 code to know this at mount time?  You can mount the file system with "mount -o errors=continue" and this will override the default behavior specified in the super block.  I would argue that a Desktop or server system that had automount should either (a) mount with -o errors=continue, or (b) force an fsck on the file system before mounting it.  So I think this is a particularly meaningless CVE, which is why I have zero respect for people who try to make any kind of conclusion based on CVE counts.   I certainly don't plan to do anything about this.  You might as well complain that since the system ships with a reboot command that can be executed by a clueless root user, that this is a potential DOS attack scenario deserving of a CVE....  	      	     	      		   - Ted  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
