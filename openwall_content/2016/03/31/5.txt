"When punching holes into a file races with the page fault of the same area, it is possible that freed blocks remain referenced from page cache pages mapped to process' address space. Thus modification of these blocks can corrupt data someone else is now storing in those blocks (which obviously has security implications if you can trick filesystem into storing some important file in those blocks).  This affects all the kernels where we support ext4 for writing. Relevant fixes upstream are commits  Please assign CVE(s).
