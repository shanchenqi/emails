Bookmarks can be stored for quick access to frequent searches in the Foreman web UI, which can be used to filter lists of hosts and other objects.  These are either marked private or public, however the UI and API for users to manage their bookmarks listed all bookmarks, including private bookmarks of other users.  This allowed them to be viewed, edited, or deleted.
