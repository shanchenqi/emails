Two options that I think are fairly straight forward to fix this: - add helpers that add "errors=remount-ro"   when a non-root user mounts the filesystem. I think "errors=remount-ro"   is safer than "errors=continue" since it blocks all later attempts to   modify the filesystem, otherwise there may be further corruption and   more risk of hitting an unhandled error condition. - add a check in ext4_fill_super() to change EXT4_ERRORS_PANIC superblock   option to EXT4_ERRORS_RO if mounted by a non-root user  >> So I think this is a particularly meaningless CVE, which is why I have >> zero respect for people who try to make any kind of conclusion based >> on CVE counts.

File system handling code, like any code that handles user supplied data should be able to handle garbage gracefully and securely. At worst it should try to mount and go "derp, it's messed up, maybe fsck it?"  I think this is a legitimate problem to fix.  The main question is how complex it is to fix?  I just don't know enough about the increasing number of ways that userspace can mount a filesystem to know how to detect this correctly in the kernel.  It may be that "non-root user" in the options above should be "removable media" instead?  Knowing the intent of the user/sysadmin is difficult.
