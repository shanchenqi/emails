These seem to be present in one or more Linux distributions and thus might have widespread deployment, e.g.,    http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/xom.git   http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/bea-stax.git  Within the context of XStream itself, we do not feel that the XomDriver or BEAStaxDriver behavior should have a CVE stating that version is vulnerable, because http://x-stream.github.io/faq.html#Security_XXEVulnerability explicitly documents the behavior, and XStream users could reasonably be expected to look at that FAQ document before choosing XomDriver or BEAStaxDriver for use with untrusted XML documents.  However, that FAQ document might suggest that the underlying problems are upstream implementation errors, e.g., the design of these pieces of code would be reasonably expected to support ignoring all external entities but did not achieve that:    https://java.net/projects/xom/sources/svn/content/trunk/src/nu/xom/tests/BuilderTest.java   private static class NonEntityResolvingFilter extends XMLFilterImpl      src/com/bea/xml/stream/ConfigurationContextBase.java  Does anyone want to request two CVE IDs for these two products?
