Props Marc > Montpas from Sucuri.  Also post notes that this might be related commit:   This case seems to be still unassigned. Is it possible to get a CVE assigned for this vulnerability, thank you? WP Super Cache does have over million active installations according to the WordPress Plugin Directory. Is there a reason that this never got assigned? If additional information is needed I can provide it.  - --  Henri Salo -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  GGscrRUOdTPqmpKSDjaV =tCbo -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
