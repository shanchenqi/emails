There has been however some progress since  It has new references to add:  RFC was written to address this CVE:  And the Linux Kernel has implemented this in   commit Author: Eric Dumazet <edumazet@...gle.com> Date:   Tue Jul 17      tcp: implement RFC 3.2          Implement the RFC mitigation against Blind     Reset attack using RST bit.          Idea is to validate incoming RST sequence,     to match RCV.NXT value, instead of previouly accepted     window : (RCV.NXT <= SEG.SEQ < RCV.NXT+RCV.WND)          If sequence is in window but not an exact match, send     a "challenge ACK", so that the other part can resend an     RST with the appropriate sequence.          Add a new sysctl, tcp_challenge_ack_limit, to limit     number of challenge ACK sent per second.          Add a new SNMP counter to count number of challenge acks sent.     (netstat -s | grep TCPChallengeACK)          Signed-off-by: Eric Dumazet <edumazet@...gle.com>     Cc: Kiran Kumar Kella <kkiran@...adcom.com>     Signed-off-by: David S.
