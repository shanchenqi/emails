I could of course be wrong, we never actually got a response from Mitre on my November email about this.  I'd be happy to bring it up on the board list again (CC'ed). Mitre can you enlighten us please?   > > > -- > bye, > pabs > > http://bonedaddy.net/pabs3/ > >   --   -- Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
