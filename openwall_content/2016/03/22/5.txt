Thanks.  Meanwhile, @idl3r tweeted what is claimed to be and looks like a relevant but possibly incomplete PoC for this bug:  <idl3r> Sent a proposal about to CSW but got no response. Didn't know you guys found it too :D @jduck @ZIMPERIUM <@idl3r> @jduck Here is a rough PoC if you'd like to try, better success rate is also possible https://github.com/idl3r/testcode/blob/master/test2.c  I've attached this file, for archival.  The default target_addr looks like it was being tested on a specific kernel for AArch64, but there's nothing very arch specific in here. The SELinux mode check suggests that target_addr is probably meant to hit that one variable in the kernel, although there are many other relevant targets.
