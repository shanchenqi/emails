Right, this is my thinking as well.  If you create very high barriers to automated spamming, and protect against DDoS, then the level of manual spam should be low enough that minimal moderation would be required.  Of course you could also start white listing people who have posted more than N approved comments, etc.  And apply some bayesian filters on new postings from unknown people.  It's all doable, and likely less work than what the CVE moderators have to do now.  The hard work is building the system initially and finding a way to get enough volunteers involved for distributed hosting and moderation.  tim  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
