There is a group called VRDX-SIG:    https://www.first.org/global/sigs/vrdx  An approach we are taking is to develop a simple cross-reference protocol, such that any vulnerability ID can be related to any other (e.g., equivalent-to, superset, subset, similar-to, not-equivalent). This approach was chosen intentionally to avoid creating yet another CVE-like system, but to support the expected fracturing of vulnerability ID systems.   - Art  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
