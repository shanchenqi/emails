I see that as only one component of having a distributed database. Who's running the cron job that constantly pulls down updates from the github server?  How do you ensure it's synced up when a legal threat causes the main repo to go black?    > See above. That's the whole point of the artifacts database.

I did look.  Sorry I missed the artifacts.  The git repos and documentation make it far from obvious where that info lies.  Ok so is "A database of artifacts, files and related files for DWF entries (so that when websites disappear the required content is hopefully still available)" in an email the sum of your documentation on that right now?  Just want to be sure I didn't miss something else.   Do you have ideas on how to capture vendor advisories?  Vendors are almost certainly, in 99% of cases, going to ignore the DWF for a long time.  Perhaps forever.  We're currently lucky to get many of them to even include a CVE # in their own advisory.  How can that information be captured without moderators having to do all the work?  Have you thought about how we can deal with the copyright issues associated with copying vendor content directly into the DWF for archival?  What I'm thinking is that perhaps there's a way to make vendors *want* to post information.  Also, perhaps there could be a way to license DWF numbering in such a way that vendors implicitly agree that the DWF can re-publish.  Or maybe there's a way to work with the Internet Archive to have third-party URLs archived automatically when they are first posted.
