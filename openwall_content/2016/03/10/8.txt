Affected configurations          All versions of OpenSSH prior to with X11Forwarding 	enabled.  2. Vulnerability  	Missing sanitisation of untrusted input allows an 	authenticated user who is able to request X11 forwarding 	to inject commands to xauth(1).  	Injection of xauth commands grants the ability to read 	arbitrary files under the authenticated user's privilege, 	Other xauth commands allow limited information leakage, 	file overwrite, port probing and generally expose xauth(1), 	which was not written with a hostile user in mind, as an 	attack surface.  	xauth(1) is run under the user's privilege, so this 	vulnerability offers no additional access to unrestricted 	accounts, but could circumvent key or account restrictions 	such as sshd_config ForceCommand, authorized_keys 	command="..." or restricted shells.  3. Mitigation          Set X11Forwarding=no in sshd_config. This is the default.  	For authorized_keys that specify a "command" restriction, 	also set the "restrict" (available in OpenSSH >=7.2) or 	"no-x11-forwarding" restrictions.  4. Details          As part of establishing an X11 forwarding session, sshd(8) 	accepts an X11 authentication credential from the client. 	This credential is supplied to the xauth(1) utility to 	establish it for X11 applications that the user subsequently 	runs.  	The contents of the credential's components (authentication 	scheme and credential data) were not sanitised to exclude 	meta-characters such as newlines. An attacker could 	therefore supply a credential that injected commands to 	xauth(1). The attacker could then use a number of xauth 	commands to read or overwrite arbitrary files subject to 	file permissions, connect to local ports or perform attacks 	on xauth(1) itself.  	OpenSSH implements a whitelist of characters that 	are permitted to appear in X11 authentication credentials.  5. Credit          This issue was identified by github.com/tintinweb and 	communicated to the OpenSSH developers on March 3rd,  6. Fix          Portable OpenSSH contains a fix for this vulnerability.  	Patches for supported OpenBSD releases (5.7, 5.8 and 5.9) have 	been committed to the -STABLE branches and are available on the 	errata pages:  	http://www.openbsd.org/errata57.html 	http://www.openbsd.org/errata58.html 	http://www.openbsd.org/errata59.html  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
