By overwriting an ephemeral or root disk with a malicious image before requesting a resize, an authenticated user may be able to read arbitrary files from the compute host. Only setups using libvirt driver with raw storage and setting "use_cow_images = False" (not default) are affected.   Errata ~~~~~~ The former fix did not take into account the usage of non-disk-image backends and caused a regression for this use-case. This update provides an additional fix for that issue.
