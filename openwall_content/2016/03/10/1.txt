Just look to all the public bugzillas out there that allow commenting (mozilla, webkit, redhat, gnome, etc). I don't think they have a problem with spam. But you have to create an account first to do any comment.  Of course any account used for spam is blocked by the moderators. So the spammer has to create a new one, which is just not worth the effort.
