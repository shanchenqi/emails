So as far as I'm concerned that while inconvenient, what you did isn't really all that wrong (ideally git upstream should have notified distros with a heads up, but again, that's an optional step).  If you need help handling a vulnerability/coordinating the embargo/etc you can reach out to Red Hat and we can at least point you in the right direction, if not directly help ourselves (e.g. if we ship it we're more than happy to help!), secalert@...hat.com for that.
