Users of gerrit are also affected due to gerrit‑gc (so even probably  google’s servers). But as the frontend is Jgit, the installed git  version number is hidden (so the only way is to exploit remote code  execution). (and this was because wikmedia used gerrit they were  threat). Because gerrit‑gc rely on git, not on Jgit.  And for fun, a switch to java git might not be a good bet. Because I  also probably found a server side memory leak in Jgit which can be  triggered with a simple clone access (which I would be able to confirm  once that vendor get that   again (so they can ship it to me, so I can replace the one that died)).  Concerning github, I already told they fixed github enterprise in  December, and of course they did for the main site at the same time :  https://bounty.github.com  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
