While I’m sure the affected variables aren’t at the end of  allocated heap, I definitely lack the required skills to produce a proof  for remote code execution  (I can put arbitrary  data in paths but I don’t know how to exploit a heap overflow even  without aslr and dep). Being too lazy, I didn’t get the required mark to  go at the university which could have taught it (I had to go at an  another one). So I won’t write it.  If someone is interested in producing such proof … Please do it   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
