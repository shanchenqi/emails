We don't see any issue with re-opening the discussion at this point, but could you please provide new information or a counterargument?  For example, in is the security concern that someone may deploy a web application that accepts arbitrary untrusted TIFF files and is intended to print EXIF values, but would realistically instead print the contents of other memory locations associated with a different client's session?  In the UTC]" comment says 'I'm sorry but I cannot change the bug type. It is not "Security".' Was it supposed to have been categorized as a security bug, or is the discussion from 6 months ago applicable:    This might be primarily an interoperability bug. doesn't attempt   to show that the hashes produced by PHP's HAVAL implementation had   weaker security properties than those produced by a correct   implementation. (One might also argue that applications requiring   especially good hash properties should not be using HAVAL at all.)  ?  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  CAqu4MIzM9VyDkcLYcF/ =mvYU -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
