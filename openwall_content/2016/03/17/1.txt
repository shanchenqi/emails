(The commit message does not seem closely related to the code changes.)  Our understanding is that the Prepopulate module was packaged in, for example, Fedora 23. The file shipped in apparently does not have the changes. Thus, we feel that the best available information is that and affects or affected, at least, Fedora 23.  (For example, see the package file.)  (We understand that Drupal 6 end-of-life was last month according to the https://www.drupal.org/drupal-6-eol post. We also understand that exists. However, may still be in use on many Fedora 23 systems.)  We may be sending a separate reply about the USASearch, Google Analytics Counter, Hubspot CTA, Node Notify, and Fieldable Panels Panes issues.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =huG5 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
