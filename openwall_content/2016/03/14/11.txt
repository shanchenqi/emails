This has been fixed in commit (master version, similar commits in other branches):  commit Author:     Dr. Stephen Henson <st...@...nssl.org> AuthorDate: Thu Mar 3 Commit:     Dr. Stephen Henson <st...@...nssl.org> CommitDate: Fri Mar 4      Sanity check PVK file fields.      PVK files with abnormally large length or salt fields can cause an     integer overflow which can result in an OOB read and heap corruption.     However this is an rarely used format and private key files do not     normally come from untrusted sources the security implications not     significant.      Fix by limiting PVK length field to and salt to 10K: these should be     more than enough to cover any files encountered in practice.      Issue reported by Guido Vranken.      Reviewed-by: Rich Salz <rs...@...nssl.org>   As per the notes in the commit we do not see the security implications as significant and therefore we are treating this as a bug and will not be issuing a CVE.
