Why should these get a CVE?  As you state in one of your reports:    While I appreciate that passing untrusted code to gawk is not a   common thing to do, I do not believe that it should be possible to   trigger a segfault though.  Why should that be considered a valid / safe use case at all?  If something makes awk run untrusted programs, there's code execution problem already:    echo | awk '{ system("id") }'  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
