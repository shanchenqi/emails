This has definitely resulted in issues being publicized with no CVE that then makes it much harder to track and deal with these issues.  I'm also worryingly hearing about people that may have given up asking for CVEs and publicizing their work at all, but of course cannot easily confirm this as I don't have any access on insight into what cve-assign@...re.org is actually doing/who they are talking to.  I finally was able to get a researcher willing to "go on the record" as it were, with thanks to Hanno Bรถck for stepping up.  My main concern is this, if this tiered coverage ( https://cve.mitre.org/cve/data_sources_product_coverage.html) is the new way forwards we will have significantly less CVE coverage in a time where security issues are literally exploding and becoming much more of a problem leading to a situation where I fear that CVE will not be as useful anymore. As CVE is the cornerstone of our industry for identifying vulnerabilities and making it much easier to track and search for them I think it's critical that we re-examine this tier'ed coverage policy that Mitre arbitrarily decided to enact (there was a brief discussion at with some concerns raised and not really addressed).   ---------- Forwarded message ---------- From: Hanno Bรถck <hanno@...eck.de> Date: Fri, Mar 4, at AM Subject: Fw: CVE request: nonce reuse in GCM implementation of Radware Load balancers To: Kurt Seifried <kseifried@...hat.com>   This was the issue I requested a CVE for: https://kb.radware.com/Questions/SecurityAdvisory/Public/Security-Advisory-Explicit-Initialization-Vector-f  (And currently I'd apprechiate if you don't make a big buzz out of this issue, because we're preparing a paper on it by the end of march where we'll disclose a bunch of similar issues)  Begin forwarded message:  Date: Thu, 11 Feb From: CVE ID Requests <cve-assign@...re.org> To: Hanno Bรถck <hanno@...eck.de> Cc: CVE ID Requests <cve-assign@...re.org> Subject: RE: CVE request: nonce reuse in GCM implementation of Radware Load balancers   Thank you for your request.  Your request is outside the scope of CVE's published priorities. As such, it will not be assigned a CVE-ID by MITRE or another CVE CNA at this time.  CVE-ID assignments are made according to the priorities published at http://cve.mitre.org/cve/data_sources_product_coverage.html. Processing of CVE-ID requests for non-prioritized products can occur at any time, but the CVE-ID assignments may be delayed.  If you feel that our assessment is in error, or that the product or products in question should be included within the CVE published priorities, please provide MITRE with your justification(s).  -- CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ]   -- Hanno Bรถck https://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:    --   -- Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com  Content of type "text/html" skipped  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
