I think it's been said on this list previously -- these are two separate activities:  1. Assigning IDs  2. Analysis, deconfliction, write-up  Binding these together results in delay, because #2 takes considerably more calendar time and effort.  Another result is a limited but fairly high quality set of entries (once #2 is complete).  I share Kurt's concern that CVE is not meeting a researcher/disclosure use case of having IDs for vulnerabilities, and that the community will at some point stop bothering with CVE.  I'm not sure how bad such an outcome would be, or what impact that would have on CVE.   - Art    Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
