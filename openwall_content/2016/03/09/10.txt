There is not a meeting with the Editorial Board (or a subset of Editorial Board members) scheduled for or being held tomorrow.   We would like to propose an Editorial Board meeting to address issues related to CVE operations, scalability, and community feedback, as was first suggested by Kent Landfield on January 5, (Full discussion thread available at:   The internal meetings referenced above will enable us to come to that Editorial Board meeting with specific recommendations and proposed next steps.    Best Regards, The MITRE CVE Team  -----Original Message----- From: Kurt Seifried [mailto:kseifried@...hat.com]  Sent: Wednesday, March 09, PM To: David A.
