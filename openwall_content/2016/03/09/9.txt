Reed" <security-officer@....org> To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com cc: security-officer@....org Subject: ISC BIND vulnerabilities are now public    Please be advised that ISC announced security advisories for vulnerabilities in ISC BIND.  An error parsing input received by the rndc control channel can cause an assertion failure in sexpr.c or alist.c. All versions since are affected.  A problem parsing resource record signatures for DNAME resource records can lead to an assertion failure in resolver.c or db.c. All versions since are affected.  A response containing multiple DNS cookies causes servers with cookie support enabled to exit with an assertion failure in resolver.c. This affects the versions.    Jeremy C.
