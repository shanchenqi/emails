Thanks David for finding the right people and raising the issue with them.  I'm sure media coverage is probably helping as well:    Suppose MITRE fixes their issues tomorrow and the CVE goes back to the way it was.  Is that really want we need going forward?  A system that's based on sending emails between humans and posting only one-line descriptions with a series of links (half of which are broken after a short time)?  A system which tries to distribute the load by using "big" software vendors, many of whom have a vested interest in limiting what vulnerabilities get published in their software?  It seems like we can do better than this.  Infosec hasn't been "working" for some time.  Perhaps we need better tools to help us get ahead of the game.  -- tim @ecbftw  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
