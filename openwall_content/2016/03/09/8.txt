The bug is triggered when a user tries to authenticate a buddy and happens in the function create_smp_dialog.  The bug was discovered with Address Sanitizer. This is yet another example why all C/C++ code should be tested with Address Sanitizer enabled.  This bug was already independently discovered and reported in the otr bug tracker. https://bugs.otr.im/issues/88  Independend of this bug another more severe bug in Libotr itself was also disclosed today, please make sure you update both libotr and the pidgin-otr plugin  Upstream bug report (contains Address Sanitizer stack trace): Commit / fix:  --  Hanno Bรถck https://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
