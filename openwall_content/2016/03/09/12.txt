Putting on my info security economics hat:  And I suspect the solution to this is the same as Open Source, we scale out, build a community and process that works and change as needed. DWF is one such effort. We aim to reduce the cost of vulnerability identification, and vulnerability coordination so that there's more less negative incentive (cost in time and effort) to do this right.  As I've repeatedly stated the DWF wants to work with CVE/Mitre if possible, forking vulnerability identification will create additional costs (retooling all the systems and process that rely on CVE) so I want to minimize that as much as possible, the goal is to make things better and easier, not to add another standard for the sake of itself.   > > -- > tim > @ecbftw >    --   -- Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
