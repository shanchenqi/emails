It's unclear what the word "we" means here. If Red Hat at some point wrote code that ships in a Red Hat product and, upon internal review, Red Hat discovers that it supports (for example) DES, then Red Hat can choose to assign a CVE ID if Red Hat is announcing a required security update to remove DES for reasons of Red Hat policy or perceived expectations of Red Hat customers.  MITRE does not assign CVE IDs to track whether the universe of products has similar or dissimilar time scales in adapting to technology changes.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  qRfdvYK+lXat94W+DxPh =QGDB -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
