There's no general answer to that question. CVE ID assignments are not based on outsiders making guesses about the expectations of a product's customers. For example, there might be a crypto library intended for communication on isolated networks to high-value embedded devices that support only SSLv2, and cannot and will not ever be updated.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =ylcp -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
