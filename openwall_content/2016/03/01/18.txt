From your web page "CVE is a dictionary of > publicly known information security vulnerabilities and exposures."  If a vendor is announcing a security update that removes SSLv2 support, they can map to any CVE IDs associated with the SSLv2 protocol to indicate their motivation for that security update. For example, they can list in their advisory. If anyone is discussing the security properties of a product (even before such an update is announced), they can mention that -- for example -- is applicable to that product. If a vendor really wants to emphasize that they are removing SSLv2 support for multiple unspecified reasons, then the CVE team at MITRE could assign a separate CVE ID; however, it doesn't seem especially helpful to have that widespread risk of overlapping IDs as a default position.  will be in the mentioned dictionary on the CVE web site very soon, indicating that it is a vulnerability in the SSLv2 protocol (the text will be used initially). Anyone building a vulnerability database on top of CVE can feel free to populate that database's entry with an arbitrarily comprehensive product list, to help with the "track which products are using SSLv2" goal that you mentioned. CVE is not a vulnerability database, and generally has not offered comprehensive product mappings for protocol-level vulnerabilities.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  WObLmO4imwD5rZZmKyxI =wfuM -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
