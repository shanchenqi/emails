Essentially we'd be saying "SSLv2 is so bad, that supporting/enabling it by default in a crypto library is CVE worthy" (essentially under the CVE assignment for "product makes a security claim that it fails to do properly").  -- Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
