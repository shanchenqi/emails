With the right gadgets available on the classpath, these side effects could lead to DoS, memory corruption, and possibly RCE.  https://www.contrastsecurity.com/security-influencers/serialization-must-di e-act-1-kryo  Thanks, --  Arshan Dabirsiaghi | Chief Scientist Contrast Security, Inc. <http://www.contrastsecurity.com/>   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
