Quite a lot was upstreamed and a bunch more in patches, this really made it easier to disable SSLv2 support in OpenSSL when we did it in OpenBSD.  > Linking with LibreSSL would help uncover those cases, and assign CVEs :)  There shouldn't be all that many left for SSLv2. There are a number of patches in OpenBSD ports for SSLv*3* removal, some upstreamed - if OS/distros are already going through ABI change pain at this point to drop SSLv2, why not go the whole hog and drop v3 as well while you're at it?
