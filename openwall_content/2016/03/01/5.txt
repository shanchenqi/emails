Now we have yet another significant SSLv2 problem, DROWN, bad enough in fact that Red Hat has now disabled SSLv2 in OpenSSL by default (already done in NSS/GnuTLS), so from my vendor perspective, we're treating SSLv2 support as a security problem, the solution of which is to remove said support.  But more generally, should we look at assigning CVE's for support of SSLv2, much like we would for products supporting DES or other known insecure cryptographic algorithms, hashes, digests and protocols? My personal vote is for yes.      -- Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
