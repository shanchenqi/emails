Especially regarding vulnerabilities that did not fit into existing vulnerability classes or would require some amount of work to validate. It seems to me MITRE currently wants to improve CVE quality but does not have the resources to do a real and fair validation. In my mind having a globally accepted enumeration systems and unique vulnerability identifiers is more important than a small curated but outdated list of selected vulnerabilities.  Therefore I would appreciate to move back to the old process where you would request a CVE, get it assigned - but with the possibility of revocation later. Or move to a fully automated process like OVE as proposed here before.  Markus  --  Markus Vervier (Managing Director) X41 D-SEC GmbH, Dennewartstr.
