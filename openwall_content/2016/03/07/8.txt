While I like the idea of being able to trivially get a global identifier for a vulnerability I find those with no information,. i.e. Unknown attack vector and impacts, useless. There's no good way to prioritise these: if you assume the worst case you get drowned in a sea of vulnerabilities you have to investigate.  Simon --  Sent from Kaiten Mail. Please excuse my brevity.
