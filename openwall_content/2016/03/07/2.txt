Use This CVE is about the specific pt_chown finding in the PtChownArbitraryPtsAccessViaUserNamespace document. Also, we do not want this to be considered an upstream glibc vulnerability.  (In addition, this CVE is not about whether the pt_chown program should exist at all, or about whether all users should be able to create user namespaces. Each of those is an important security topic, but the importance is a consequence of multiple issues that could be associated with multiple CVEs.)  The initial description might look roughly like:     pt_chown in the glibc package before on Debian    jessie lacks a namespace check associated with file-descriptor    passing, which allows local users to capture keystrokes and spoof    data, and possibly gain privileges, via pts read and write    operations, related to debian/sysdeps/linux.mk. NOTE: this is not    considered a vulnerability in the upstream GNU C Library because    the upstream documentation has a clear security recommendation    against the --enable-pt_chown option.  See the and commits. Here, Debian jessie is just an example; a similar statement might be made about Ubuntu Wily Werewolf, etc. The commit can be associated with (at least) two CVE IDs that motivated the change: (which is directly mentioned there) and the new   >>> On the other hand, the TIOCGPTN ioctl still is problematic with >>> USERNS, also for other tools.

We don't feel that enough information has been sent to reach a conclusion about whether the "kernel should prevent the TIOCGPTN ioctl when invoked called by a process within one namespace but acting on a filedescriptor from a devpts instance mounted in a different namespace" recommendation should have a CVE ID. We could, for example, assign separate CVE IDs to other affected applications (if any) instead.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =YYhd -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
