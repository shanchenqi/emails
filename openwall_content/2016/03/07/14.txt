You're conflating two separate things.  Thanks for clarifying this.  For some reason I expected this to be about the same issue.  On Mon, Mar 07, at Jason A.

Even so, I think a warning would have been appropriate.  The text issue is a bit more surprising, as one might certainly expect that to be safe, though a quick inspection of the code should be enough to know what's going on.  Considering that it's been "fixed", I thought a CVE might be useful to trigger distros to include the patch.  Without a CVE, distros like Debian and RedHat will keep using the unpatched version, which is a shame if such an easy fix is available.
