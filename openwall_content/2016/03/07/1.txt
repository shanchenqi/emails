While reading this whole thread I have been thinking along very similar but slightly different lines.  Right now as a vendor 'security desk' I/we have the situation where we have to allocate an internal reference ID anyway while awaiting Mitre assignment. These IDs are not spread so widely as CVE in the early stages, so we end up with other vendors and downstream distributions not quite in the same discussion loop allocating their own temporary numbers for the same issue. And some do anyway just because thats the way they operate. (Those aware of the history might recall this was the exact same situation which caused CVE to be created and centralized through Mitre in the first place.)  Having an easily self-assigned OVI number does sound nice. At least for use as a temporary ID that can be publicly shared before the proper analysis can be completed by Mitre for a CVE, which can then sub-link.
