It seems that AMD (somewhat silently) released - in - a new microcode for 15th family of AMD CPUs.  I applied this patch to the previous ucode, and got this - - which resulted in:  microcode: CPU0: new microcode: CPU2: new microcode: CPU4: new microcode: CPU6: new  Quick testing suggests that bugs from and ucode versions are gone. Unfortunately it's not published yet on http://www.amd64.org/microcode.html nor the new README/errata is available, so I have no more details on that, but given that AMD promised new ucode in March fixing this problem - as per - this might be it.  --  Robert Święcki  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
