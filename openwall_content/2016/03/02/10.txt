We feel that this should most likely have a CVE ID. The discussion outlines a realistic problem "it is possible for a single process to cause an OOM condition by filling large pipes with data that are never read. A typical process filling pipes with 1 MB of data will use 4 GB of memory" and the need for a CVE ID does not depend on the details of the solution approach. Also, there doesn't seem to be any general opposition to addressing the problem (e.g., see the post).  However, the commit indicates that there isn't a mandatory behavior change ("The limit are controlled by two new sysctls : pipe-user-pages-soft, and pipe-user-pages-hard. Both may be disabled by setting them to zero.") -- suggesting a possible interpretation as a design enhancement, not a vulnerability fix. Also, the discussion doesn't directly comment on whether the "filling large pipes" scenario has a security impact that is otherwise unavailable to the attacker, e.g., it doesn't discuss the difference between the attacker choosing to fill pipes and the attacker choosing to use mmap.  Is there anyone who believes must not have a CVE ID?  > The commit says: "Mitigates: (Linux 2.0+)"  Regardless of any answers to the above question, it is not going to be useful to use to refer to  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  8mWQWhBXp+LU6fTUHdZi =pIDG -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
