Exploitation of this would be an attacker uses code to exploit a poor  implementation or design problem. There are code weaknesses tracked by CWE,  vulnerabilities in implementations tracked by CVE, and attacks tracked by  CAPEC. They reference each other as follows CAPEC->CVE->CWE.  Maybe a CWE somewhere in this category is what you are after:  -Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
