While you certainly won't see me defending SSLv2 (I think we were the first to delete it outright) there are many other things that currently fall into that category.. I'm agreeing with your sentiment but if you are to consider usage of SSLv2 as CVE worthy, then you will need to do the same for SSH version 1, among other things.   So while I certainly appreciate and even agree with your sentiment, it seems rather timed politically based on a decision made by one implementaiton of SSL/TLS that reflects a decision made by most other implementations long ago.   So far from me to say what CVE's should and shouldn't be used for and issued for, but if this is the road we're going down can I please have permission to use your above quoted paragraph with s/SSLv2/SSH V1/g to request a CVE for *usage or support* of SSH version 1? You said it perfectly.  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
