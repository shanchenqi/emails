Telnet makes no security claims, explicit, implied or otherwise. It's a simple clear text protocol. In fact if you want to secure it you can use SSL enabled Telnet (in fact I remember fighting with it prior to the wide spread existence of SSH and then OpenSSH).  SSL and TLS both makes explicit and implicit claims about security, most notably at a minimum:  1) the SSL/TLS protocols encrypt the and the data cannot be read by an attacker 2) the SSL/TLS protocols ensure the data is not altered in transit by an attacker without detection  Additionally depending on how you configure the servers there are claims that you are talking to the correct server/client (e.g. using certificates) but that is not germane to this discussion.  SSLv2 is obviously NOT capable of ensuring claim #1 (that data is encrypted and cannot be read by an attacker), due to a wide variety of issues, and I have no doubt more will be found if people keep looking. Hence my thinking is that ANY and ALL use of SSLv2 is CVE worthy, especially when considering that many devices/manufacturers are less than transparent about their configurations/security issues.   -- Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
