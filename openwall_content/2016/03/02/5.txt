SugarCRM Incomplete Blacklist leading to shell upload. This is the exact same issue as except different product was issued for SuiteCRM, which is a SugarCRM fork). Unsure if this needs a second CVE issued or not given it is a different product (same original codebase though). The version tested was SugarCRM Community Edition version  VTiger CRM Post-Auth Shell Upload. Version Tested: vtiger CRM 4.2 Patch 2 This is a similar issue to the original SugarCRM and SuiteCRM issues. Effectively, the filtering applied to prevent uploading executable files is insufficient and trivially bypassed, leading to remote code execution. The checks avoided are a horrible "check if there is PHP in the file" function, getimagesize(), a MIME type check, and a file extension check. Given that it is a different code-path entirely to the original SugarCRM codebase, it probably should be treated as a different issue.  Details are outlined here, to avoid repeating the same information:  Both issues (SugarCRM and VTigerCRM) require authentication, however both clearly display bypass of intended security restrictions.
