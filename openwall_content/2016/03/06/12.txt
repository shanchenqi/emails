Website compromised?  Hello oss-security.  According to these three links,  and the project homepage https://www.transmissionbt.com/  The mac build of version of the popular Transmission bittorent client was infected by malware. However, there's not much information about the source of the actual malware:  * How did it get to the official download location? Was it a compromised server or someone with access abusing it to distribute malware? What steps did the transmission project take to ensure that the attacker no longer has access to their server? When were the infected files uploaded to the server? And, most importantly, are builds for other platforms and source code archive download affected in any way?  Transmission is included in many Linux distributions (default in some of them). If the source code archives (which are not signed, there's only a checksum on their website, but if it was compromised then it's not exactly useful) used by these distributions to build Transmission were tampered with as well this might mean malicious code is already inside the Transmission packages in these distributions. While the malware mentioned in the link above is Mac specific, it is still possible that other downloads have been infected by different types of malware.  Since I couldn't find any security related email address or mailing list for the transmission project specifically, I'm sending this to oss-security in hopes that relevant people will see this and will shed more light on this story.  --  -Elad.
