Oh, I wasn't aware of it, and a Google search for "freeovi" or "ovi id" finds only irrelevant stuff now.  I think it was not publicized enough. Also, there's a name clash of "freeovi" with some old Nokia maps stuff.  As to the button (non-)issue, I brought it to Twitter poll.  Of course, it's not the same crowd as oss-security, but I want to get an overall picture of how strongly people feel in favor of not wasting IDs, without spamming this list with "+1" replies:   In fact, there are pretty strong results after a few minutes already.  One of my concerns was that people would be hunting for vanity OVE IDs. I didn't want to encourage waste of time on that, nor attempts to increase the counter up to a pretty-looking number.  The latter is one of the reasons why I chose to include the full date rather than just the year - this makes numbers like less valuable, since there's one of each of those every day.  (Another reason to include the full date is that it may sometimes provide some insight into disclosure timelines, even if not reliably.  I suspect some people won't like that, though.) I think OVI, if it gains popularity and is not adjusted, is far more "vulnerable" to such vanity ID hunting.  Also, having the IDs increase up to a few thousand on each normal day may discourage deliberate/malicious attempts to do so, and people trying to skip IDs on such days and come back for lower IDs tomorrow.  However, there appears to be a psychological aspect with spilling unrequested IDs on the page.  It makes many people feel sorry.  I think I underestimated that.  (Another workaround would be to use randomized yet 4-digit IDs, but being able to get some sequential IDs is very nice for assigning them to related vulnerabilities.  This is why the page currently spills 10 IDs at once on a second page load from the same IP address, and a few times more, as long as the current ID is sufficiently below to allow for this generosity.)
