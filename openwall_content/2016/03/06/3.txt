(Also considered captcha.)  I like to emphasize how very easy it is to obtain OVE IDs.  Not even having to click a button serves that goal well.  I don't mind adding a button a bit later, though.

So prepare for the above link to become really popular.  As it is, it should survive quite a few thousand of unique IPs per day (and yes, it temporarily records per IP address statistics, and it has per-IP and per-netblock limits), before (gradually) denying service for the rest of the day.  It might or might not survive a Slashdot-alike event, but even if not then waiting a day for the next batch of IDs is quicker than waiting weeks for CVE IDs.  BTW, there is not a hard-coded limit of  There is logic in place to try and keep the daily IDs within (the service becomes less generous as the 4-digit space gets closer to being exhausted), but if the requests and unique IPs are too numerous this may be crossed anyway, resulting in 5- or 6-digit IDs (and going back to 4-digit the next day).
