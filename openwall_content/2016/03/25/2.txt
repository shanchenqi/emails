By uploading an archive containing a file named ../../../public/hello.txt will write the file âhello.txtâ to the directory. This could be used to, for example, overwrite the /usr/bin/convert file (or any other 3 rd party integrated executable) with a shell script, which would be executed the next time an image file is uploaded and imagemagick is invoked.
