For this purpose it supports a lot of different XML parsers.  Some of those can also process external entities which was enabled by  default.  An attacker could therefore provide manipulated XML as input to access data  on the file system, see  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Processing  Since XStream all parsers are configured to ignore external entities  by default as far as such behavior is configurable:  Luckily XStream's default parser Xpp3 does not parse entities at all.  However, all application that use XStream >= explicitly with parsers  based on StAX, W3C DOM, Dom4J, JDOM or JDOM2 were affected unless the  parsers had been properly configured manually.  Applications using XOM or explicitly BEA's old StAX reference parser are  still vulnerable, we found no way to deactivate processing of external  entities for those two.
