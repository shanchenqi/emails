ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  There is a workaround in Xen to deal with the fact that AMD CPUs don't load the x86 registers FIP (and possibly FCS), FDP (and possibly FDS), and FOP from memory (via XRSTOR or FXRSTOR) when there is no pending unmasked exception.  (See XSA-52.)  However, this workaround does not cover all possible input cases. This is because writes to the hardware FSW.ES bit, which the current workaround is based on, are ignored; instead, the CPU calculates FSW.ES from the pending exception and exception mask bits.  Xen therefore needs to do the same.  Note that part of said workaround was the subject of XSA-52.  This can leak register contents from one guest to another.  The registers in question are the FPU instruction and data pointers and opcode.  IMPACT ======  A malicious domain is able to obtain address space usage and timing information, about another domain, at a fairly low rate.  The leaked address information might be used to help defeat address space randomisation in order to enable another attack.  The leaked address and timing information forms a low-bandwidth covert channel which might be used to gain information about the operation of a target guest.  The affected FPU facility would not normally be used by cryptographic operations, as it does not provide cryptographically-relevant SIMD functions.  It appears to us very unlikely that the leak might directly compromise sensitive information such as cryptographic keys, although (without knowledge of the guest software) this cannot be ruled out.  (This is notwithstanding the contrary statement in `Impact' in XSA-52.)  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen versions 4.0 and onwards are vulnerable.  Any kind of guest can exploit the vulnerability.  The vulnerability is exposed only on AMD x86 systems.  Intel and ARM systems do not expose this vulnerability.  Both PV and HVM guests are affected.  MITIGATION ==========  The vulnerability can be avoided if the guest kernel is controlled by the host rather than guest administrator, provided that further steps are taken to prevent the guest administrator from loading code into the kernel (e.g. by disabling loadable modules etc) or from using other mechanisms which allow them to run code at kernel privilege.  On Xen versions 4.3 and earlier, turning off XSAVE support via the "no-xsave" hypervisor command line option will avoid the vulnerability.  On Xen versions 4.4 and onwards there is no other known mitigation.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich from SUSE.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            xen-unstable, Xen 4.6.x, Xen 4.5.x, Xen 4.4.x       Xen 4.3.x  $   $  NOTE REGARDING CVE ==================  is for the code change which is required for all versions (but which is sufficient only on Xen 4.3.x, and insufficient on later versions).  Ie for the second hunk in (the only hunk in which patches the function xrstor.  is for the code change which is applicable for later versions only, but which must always be combined with the code change for  Ie for the first hunk in which patches the function fpu_fxrstor.  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the PATCH or the TRUSTED KERNEL MITIGATION (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  However deployment of the "no-xsave" MITIGATION is NOT permitted (except where all the affected systems and VMs are administered and used only by organisations which are members of the Xen Project Security Issues Predisclosure List).  Specifically, deployment on public cloud systems is NOT permitted.  This is because such a host configuration change would be guest-visible which could lead to the rediscovery of the vulnerability.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.   (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
