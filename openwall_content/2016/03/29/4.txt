This occurs in the function ext4_handle_error who call the panic function on precise circumstance. This was tested on severals linux kernel version: on real hardware and Xen DomU PV & HVM (the crash report attached is from a Fedora PV DomU), from different distribution release: Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, Linux Mint, QubesOS. This a low security impact bug, because generally only root can mount image, however on Desktop (or possibly server?) system configured with automount the bug is easily triggable (think of android smartphone?Haven't test yet). The crafted image may be burn onto SD card or USB key to crash a large panel of linux box.   [ EXT4-fs error (device loop0): inode #2: comm mount: bad extended attribute block [ Kernel panic - not syncing: EXT4-fs (device loop0): panic forced after error [ [ CPU: 1 PID: Comm: mount Tainted: G O #1 [ [ [ [ Call Trace: [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ ?

(sorry for the inconvenient): poc.ext2 poc.ext3  Can you assign a CVE for this? Thank for reading and your time.  Hugues ANGUELKOV.
