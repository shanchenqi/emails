Use This CVE is for the "principle of least surprise" violation in which the administrator configured a security-relevant setting to one value, but the product's behavior used a potentially worse value. This CVE is not specifically about whether is "dangerous" or about whether should be configurable at all.   > The release notes[1] are confusing, as they mention only problems with > keys smaller than bit, but I was also able to reproduce this issue > with bit keys. > [1]  We are not sure why this would be confusing.  "SSH RSA hostkeys smaller than bits now work properly" in those release notes corresponds to an entirely different issue, described at:       This issue does not have a CVE ID. Very roughly, the issue seems to be about "it is possible for the administrator to configure the product so that it is easier for a client to cause a DoS to that client's own session."  The issue corresponds only to the third item, i.e., "Fixed selection of DH groups from TLSDHParamFile."  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  lJDpyWFeYDFTV0CnDDqh =ErAX -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
