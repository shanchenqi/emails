This module has a configuration option TLSDHParamFile to specify user-defined Diffie Hellman parameters.  Versions older than / had a bug that would cause the software to ignore the parameters and use Diffie Hellman key exchanges with bit:  The release notes[1] are confusing, as they mention only problems with keys smaller than bit, but I was also able to reproduce this issue with bit keys. But anyway, it is fixed in the latest versions for all key sizes I have tested.  As bit DH is considered dangerously small these days and breakable by a powerful attacker I think this should be considered a security vulnerability.
