I would give anyone willing to contribute full access to the wiki on  https://github.com/halfdog/DistributedCryptoenhancedVulnerabilityEnumeration/wiki  (hope github supports that).  hd  --  http://www.halfdog.net/ PGP: AE98 B91F FE88  2BD8 feed a bee  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
