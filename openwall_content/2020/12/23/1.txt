OVE-20201118-0001.  I tried to get a CVE for OVE-20201118-0001 by using the "new" form at https://cveform.mitre.org/ on 2020-11-18 but was told by MITRE that "the reported vulnerabilities would fall in the scope of Red Hat for assignment" and that their mail should be forwarded to secalert@...hat.com.  I did that on 2020-11-18 using the OpenPGP key recommended at: https://access.redhat.com/security/team/contact  On 2020-11-23 I received a response from Red Hat claiming that my e-mail had "no body".  The same day I replied with an unencrypted mail explaining that the previous mail was OpenPGP-encrypted and asked whether that was still supported.  As a result I was informed that "INC1525130" "has been resolved".  As of today I still haven't received a CVE and thus did not bother to request CVEs for the other issues fixed in Privoxy 3.0.29 ...
