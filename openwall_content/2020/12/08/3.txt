Problem Some of the tag's attributes could perform a double evaluation if a developer applied forced OGNL evaluation by using the %{...} syntax. Using forced OGNL evaluation on untrusted user input can lead to a Remote Code Execution and security degradation.  Solution Avoid using forced OGNL evaluation on untrusted user input, and/or upgrade to Struts which checks if expression evaluation won't lead to the double evaluation.  Please read our Security Bulletin for more details:  This vulnerability was identified by: - Alvaro Munoz - pwntester at github dot com - Masato Anzai of Aeye Security Lab, inc.
