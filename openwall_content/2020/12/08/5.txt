At this link, multiple security bugs of various kinds are highlighted in very widespread basic cryptographic applications, which have then been corrected. I haven't done a deep analysis on all of them but I haven't found any associated CVEs of some of them. Do I have to assume that they weren't all that important or that the process of reporting them was missing?
