So if people want CVEs, someone has to actually put the effort into analyzing each bug and (if applicable) filing for a CVE. Presumably just no one has done that for the above bugs.  Something similar happened when I added fuzz tests to the Linux kernel's crypto API last year.  In less than a year they had resulted in over bug fixes. Most didn't *seem* too concerning, e.g. most were bugs in crypto drivers that seemed to be rarely used, or crypto algorithms that seemed to be rarely used, or edge cases in the crypto API that seemed to be rarely or never encountered.  The bugs in userspace libraries found by cryptofuzz look somewhat similar.  They include some of the same kinds of bugs, like mishandling zero-length inputs, mishandling data passed in specific chunk sizes, or bugs in weird algorithms.  However, in both cases it isn't possible to be certain of the impact and applicability for a CVE of each bug without analyzing each bug in detail, which would be very time-consuming, and in general it's no one's job to do that.  Likewise, syzkaller has found thousands of Linux kernel bugs and most haven't had CVEs filed.  - Eric  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
