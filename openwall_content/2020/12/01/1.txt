And I reproduced it in the latest version at that time.  Description:  It was found that the raw midi kernel driver does not protect against concurrent access which leads to a use-after-free in snd_rawmidi_kernel_read1() and snd_rawmidi_kernel_write1() in rawmidi.c file. A malicious local attacker could possibly use this for privilege escalation.  Root Cause:  The rawmidi core allows user to resize the runtime buffer via ioctl, and this may lead to UAF when performed during concurrent reads or writes: the read/write functions unlock the runtime lock temporarily during copying form/to user-space, and that's the race window.
