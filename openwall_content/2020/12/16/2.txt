CVE-2020-11969 previously addressed the creation of the JMX management interface, however the incomplete fix did not cover this edge case.  Mitigation: - Upgrade to TomEE 7.0.9 or later - Upgrade to TomEE 7.1.4 or later - Upgrade to TomEE 8.0.4 or later  Ensure the correct VM broker name is used consistently across the resource adapter config.
