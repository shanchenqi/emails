A use-after-free flaw was found in kernel/trace/ring_buffer.c in Linux kernel. There was a race problem in trace_open and resize of cpu buffer running parallely on different cpus, may cause a denial of service problem (DOS). This flaw could even allow a local attacker with special user  privilege to a kernel information leak threat.    was assigned by Red Hat.
