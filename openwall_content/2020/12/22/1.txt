It could occur while processing USB requests due to DMA memory map failure not being properly detected. This was fixed in the following commit by checking the return value of usb_packet_map(), thus preventing a reachable assertion issue from occuring in a later call of usb_packet_unmap().  Upstream commit: https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=2fdb42d840400d58f2e706ecca82c142b97bcbd6  This issue was reported by Cheolwoo Myung (cc'd). CVE-2020-25723 was assigned by Red Hat Inc.
