The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * Chaos Monkey Plugin 0.4 and * CVS Plugin * Plugin Installation Manager Tool * Shelve Project Plugin 3.1   Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://www.jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  / CVS Plugin and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.  This allows attackers able to control an agent process to have Jenkins parse a crafted changelog file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.   / Plugin Installation Manager Tool is part of the Jenkins project Docker images. As `jenkins-plugin-cli` it is used to download and install plugins even before Jenkins is running.  Plugin Installation Manager Tool and earlier does not verify plugin downloads. This may allow third parties such as mirror operators to provide crafted plugin downloads.   / Shelve Project Plugin 3.0 and earlier does not require POST requests for HTTP endpoints, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.  These vulnerabilities allow attackers to shelve, unshelve, or delete a project.   (1) / Chaos Monkey Plugin 0.3 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.  This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to generate load and to generate memory leaks.   (2) / Chaos Monkey Plugin 0.4 and earlier does not perform permission checks in an HTTP endpoint.  This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to access the Chaos Monkey page and to see the history of actions.
