While this would most likely lead to an error and the closure of the HTTP/2 connection, it is possible that information could leak between requests.  Mitigation: - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat or later - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat or later - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat or later  Credit: This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat Security Team.
