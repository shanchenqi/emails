Specifically, the return values of the 'canFlush' and 'canPerformSystemActions' security functions are not checked in some instances, therefore allowing an authenticated user with insufficient permissions to perform the following actions: flushing a table, shutting down Accumulo or an individual tablet server, and setting or removing system-wide Accumulo configuration properties.  This issue is being tracked as https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1828  Mitigation:  Upgrade to Apache Accumulo version 1.10.1, 2.0.1, or later.
