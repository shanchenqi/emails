When the X server runs with elevated privileges.  This flaw can lead to ASLR bypass, which when combined with other flaws (known/unknown) could lead to lead to privilege elevation in the client.  Patch =====  A patch for this issue has been commited to the xorg server git repository.  xorg-server will be released shortly and will include this patch.  https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver.git  diff --git a/dix/pixmap.c b/dix/pixmap.c index --- a/dix/pixmap.c +++ b/dix/pixmap.c @@ @@ AllocatePixmap(ScreenPtr pScreen, int pixDataSize)      if (pScreen->totalPixmapSize > ((size_t) - 1) - pixDataSize)          return NullPixmap;   -    pPixmap = malloc(pScreen->totalPixmapSize + pixDataSize); +    pPixmap = calloc(1, pScreen->totalPixmapSize + pixDataSize);      if (!pPixmap)          return NullPixmap;      Thanks ======  This vulnerability was discovered by Jan-Niklas Sohn working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.  --  Matthieu Herrb    _______________________________________________ xorg-announce mailing list xorg-announce@...ts.x.org https://lists.x.org/mailman/listinfo/xorg-announce   ----- End forwarded message -----  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
