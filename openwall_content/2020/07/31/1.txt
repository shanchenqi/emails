Patches =======  Patches for these issues have been commited to the libX11 git repository. libX11 will be released shortly and will include those patches.  https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libx11  commit (HEAD -> master)      Change the data_len parameter of _XimAttributeToValue() to CARD16          It's coming from a length in the protocol (unsigned) and passed     to functions that expect unsigned int parameters (_XCopyToArg()     and memcpy()).      commit      Zero out buffers in functions          It looks like uninitialized stack or heap memory can leak     out via padding bytes.       commit      Fix more unchecked lengths      commit      fix integer overflows in _XimAttributeToValue()       commit      Fix signed length values in _XimGetAttributeID()          The lengths are unsigned according to the specification. Passing     negative values can lead to data corruption.      Thanks ======  X.Org thanks Todd Carson for reporting these issues to our security team and assisting them in understanding them and providing fixes.   --  Matthieu Herrb    _______________________________________________ xorg-announce mailing list xorg-announce@...ts.x.org https://lists.x.org/mailman/listinfo/xorg-announce   ----- End forwarded message -----   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
