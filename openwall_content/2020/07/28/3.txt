Thanks for the writeup.  Note that there are many open syzbot reports in the fbdev, vt, and vgacon kernel subsystems.  These subsystems aren't actively maintained (receiving drive-by fixes only), and the kernel developers recommend to not enable these subsystems if you care about security  This particular bug, for example, appears to have been already found by someone running syzkaller and publicly reported over 2 years ago, with a C reproducer: No one did anything.  I suggest that people relying on the security of these kernel subsystems contribute resources to fixing the many known fuzzing bugs in them.  - Eric  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
