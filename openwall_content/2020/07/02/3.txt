If a user connects to a malicious or compromised RDP server, a series of specially-crafted PDUs could result in memory corruption, possibly allowing arbitrary code to be executed with the privileges of the running guacd process.  Mitigation: Users of versions of Apache Guacamole and older that provide access to untrusted RDP servers should upgrade to  Credit: We would like to thank Eyal Itkin (Check Point Research) for reporting this issue.
