The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * Fortify on Demand Plugin * Fortify on Demand Plugin * Sonargraph Integration Plugin * VncRecorder Plugin * VncViewer Plugin 1.8  Additionally, we announce unresolved security issues in the following plugins:  * Compatibility Action Storage Plugin * ElasticBox Jenkins Kubernetes CI/CD Plugin * GitHub Coverage Reporter Plugin * HP ALM Quality Center Plugin * Link Column Plugin * Slack Upload Plugin * Stash Branch Parameter Plugin * TestComplete support Plugin * White Source Plugin * ZAP Pipeline Plugin * Zephyr for JIRA Test Management Plugin  Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  / Sonargraph Integration Plugin and earlier does not escape the file path for the Log file field form validation.  This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited by users with Job/Configure permission.   / Fortify on Demand Plugin provides a list of applicable credentials IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.  This functionality does not correctly check permissions in Fortify on Demand Plugin and earlier, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.   / (CSRF) & (missing permission check) Fortify on Demand Plugin and earlier does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to the globally configured Fortify on Demand endpoint using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method.  Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.   (1) / VncRecorder Plugin and earlier does not escape a tool path in the `checkVncServ` form validation endpoint accessed e.g. via job configuration forms.  This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by Jenkins administrators.   (2) / VncRecorder Plugin and earlier does not escape a parameter value in the `checkVncServ` form validation endpoint output.  This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.   / VncViewer Plugin 1.7 and earlier does not escape a parameter value in the `checkVncServ` form validation endpoint output.  This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.   / Slack Upload Plugin 1.7 and earlier stores a secret unencrypted in job `config.xml` files as part of its configuration. This secret can be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the master file system.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / TestComplete support Plugin and earlier stores a password unencrypted in job `config.xml` files as part of its configuration. This password can be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the master file system.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / Stash Branch Parameter Plugin stores Stash API passwords in its global configuration file `org.jenkinsci.plugins.StashBranchParameter.StashBranchParameterDefinition.xml` on the Jenkins master as part of its configuration.  While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form by Stash Branch Parameter Plugin and earlier. This can result in exposure of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / ElasticBox Jenkins Kubernetes CI/CD Plugin 1.3 and earlier does not configure its YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types. This results in a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to provide YAML input files to ElasticBox Jenkins Kubernetes CI/CD Plugin's build step.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / GitHub Coverage Reporter Plugin 1.8 and earlier stores a GitHub access token in plain text in its global configuration file `io.jenkins.plugins.gcr.PluginConfiguration.xml`. This can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins master file system.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / White Source Plugin and earlier stores credentials in plain text as part of its global configuration file `org.whitesource.jenkins.pipeline.WhiteSourcePipelineStep.xml` and job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission (in the case of job `config.xml` files) or access to the master file system.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / Jenkins sets the `Content-Security-Policy` header to static files served by Jenkins (specifically `DirectoryBrowserSupport`), such as workspaces, `/userContent`, or archived artifacts.  ZAP Pipeline Plugin 1.9 and earlier globally disables the `Content-Security-Policy` header for static files served by Jenkins. This allows cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by users with the ability to control files in workspaces, archived artifacts, etc.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / (CSRF) & (missing permission check) Zephyr for JIRA Test Management Plugin 1.5 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified host using attacker-specified username and password.  Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / Compatibility Action Storage Plugin 1.0 and earlier does not escape the content coming from the MongoDB in the `testConnection` form validation endpoint. This allows attackers able to update the configured document in MongoDB to inject the payload.  This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / HP ALM Quality Center Plugin 1.6 and earlier stores a password in plain text in its global configuration file `org.jenkinsci.plugins.qc.QualityCenterIntegrationRecorder.xml`. This password can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins master file system.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / Link Column Plugin allows users with View/Configure permission to add a new column to list views that contains a user-configurable link.  Link Column Plugin 1.0 and earlier does not filter the URL for these links, allowing the `javascript:` scheme. This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure list views.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
