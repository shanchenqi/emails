ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  When page tables are shared between IOMMU and CPU, changes to them require flushing of both TLBs.  Furthermore, IOMMUs may be non-coherent, and hence prior to flushing IOMMU TLBs CPU cached also needs writing back to memory after changes were made.  Such writing back of cached data was missing in particular when splitting large page mappings into smaller granularity ones.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest may be able to retain read/write DMA access to frames returned to Xen's free pool, and later reused for another purpose.  Host crashes (leading to a Denial of Service) and privilege escalation cannot be ruled out.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen versions from at least 3.2 onwards are affected.  Only x86 Intel systems are affected.  x86 AMD as well as Arm systems are not affected.  Only x86 HVM guests using hardware assisted paging (HAP), having a passed through PCI device assigned, and having page table sharing enabled can leverage the vulnerability.  Note that page table sharing will be enabled (by default) only if Xen considers IOMMU and CPU large page size support compatible.  MITIGATION ==========  Suppressing the use of page table sharing will avoid the vulnerability (command line option "iommu=no-sharept").  Note however that as of Xen version there's also a respective per-guest control ("passthrough=" libxl guest config file option).  If any guests have been created with an explicit setting here, this setting may conflict with the addition of the "iommu=no-sharept" Xen command line option.  Suppressing the use of large HAP pages will avoid the vulnerability (command line options "hap_2mb=no hap_1gb=no").  Not passing through PCI devices to HVM guests will avoid the vulnerability.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Roger Pau MonnĂŠ of Citrix.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate set of attached patches resolves this issue.  Note that unlike implied by the numbering, the patches here are intended to go on top of  Note also that patches for released versions are generally prepared to apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.         xen-unstable   Xen   Xen   Xen   Xen    Xen 4.9.x  $                                            $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
