ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  When mapping guest EPT (nested paging) tables, Xen would in some circumstances use a series of non-atomic bitfield writes.  Depending on the compiler version and optimisation flags, Xen might expose a dangerous partially-written PTE to the hardware, which an attacker might be able to race to exploit.  IMPACT ======  A guest administrator or perhaps even unprivileged guest user might be able to cause denial of service, data corruption, or privilege escalation.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Only systems using Intel CPUs are vulnerable.  Sytems using AMD CPUs, and Arm systems, are not vulnerable.  Only systems using nested paging ("hap", aka nested paging, aka in this case Intel EPT) are vulnerable.  Only HVM and PVH guests can exploit the vulnerability.  The presence and scope of the vulnerability depends on the precise optimisations performed by the compiler used to build Xen.  If the compiler generates (a) a single 64-bit write, or (b) a series of read-modify-write operations which are in the same order as the source code, the hypervisor is not vulnerable.  For example, in one test build with gcc 8.3 with normal settings, the compiler generated multiple (unlocked) read-modify-write operations in source code order, which did *not* constitute a vulnerability.  We have not been able to survey compilers; consequently we cannot say which compiler(s) might produce vulnerable code (with which code generation options).  The code clearly violates the C rules.  So we have chosen to issue this advisory.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only PV guests will avoid this vulnerability.  Switching to shadow paging (e.g. using the "hap=0" xl domain domain configuration file parameter) will avoid exposing the vulnerability to those guests.  Manual inspection of the generated assembly code might allow a suitably qualified person to say that a particular build is not vulnerable.  There is no less broad mitigation.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.  For patch 1: Reviewed-by: Roger Pau Monné <roger.pau@...rix.com>  For patch 2: From: Roger Pau Monné <roger.pau@...rix.com> Reported-by: Jan Beulich <jbeulich@...e.com> Signed-off-by: Roger Pau Monné <roger.pau@...rix.com>  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate pair of attached patches resolves this issue.  Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.         xen-unstable   Xen   Xen   Xen Xen    Xen 4.9.x  $            $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
