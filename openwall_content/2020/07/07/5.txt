ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The hypercall VCPUOP_register_vcpu_info is used by a guest to register a shared region with the hypervisor. The region will be mapped into Xen address space so it can be directly accessed.  On Arm, the region is accessed with instructions which require a specific alignment. Unfortunately, there is no check that the address provided by the guest will be correctly aligned.  As a result, a malicious guest could cause a hypervisor crash by passing a misaligned address.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest administrator may cause a hypervisor crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen versions are vulnerable.  Only Arm systems are vulnerable.  x86 systems are not affected.  MITIGATION ==========  There is no mitigation.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Julien Grall of Amazon.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.  Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.            Xen 4.9 - xen-unstable  $   $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patch and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
