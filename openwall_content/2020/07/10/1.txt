The bubblewrap sandbox of WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit, prior to     failed to properly block access to CLONE_NEWUSER and the TIOCSTI     ioctl. CLONE_NEWUSER could potentially be used to confuse xdg-     desktop-portal, which allows access outside the sandbox. TIOCSTI can     be used to directly execute commands outside the sandbox by writing     to the controlling terminal's input buffer, similar to       We recommend updating to the latest stable versions of WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit. It is the best way to ensure that you are running safe versions of WebKit. Please check our websites for information about the latest stable releases.
