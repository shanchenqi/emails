So rather than use the new zLib and Bzip in >$HOME/tmp/ok2delete/lib, Perl uses the old ones with CVEs in /lib.

There is another possible solution on Solaris by setting the following  variables in the environment:  	LD_UNSET="-R/../lib"    (drops -R/../lib; multiple options can be 				 given)  	LD_OPTIONS='-R$ORIGIN/../lib' (multiple options possible here too)  /tmp$  cc foo.c -o foo -R/fuz -R/bar -R/blah /tmp$ dump -Lv foo | grep RPATH [5]     RPATH           /fuz:/bar:/blah /tmp$  LD_OPTIONS=-R/foo/bar LD_UNSET="-R/fuz -R/bar"  cc foo.c -o foo -R/fuz -R/bar -R/blah ld: warning: unsetting option '-R/fuz': LD_UNSET directed ld: warning: unsetting option '-R/bar': LD_UNSET directed /tmp$ dump -Lv foo | grep RPATH                                                 [5]     RPATH           /foo/bar:/blah  Casper   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
