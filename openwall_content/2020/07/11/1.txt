Promptly review new issue reports for meeting the list's requirements and confirm receipt of the report and, when necessary, inform the reporter of any issues with their report (e.g., obviously not actionable by the distros) and request and/or propose any required yet missing information (most notably, a tentative public disclosure date/time) /- primary: Oracle, backup: vacant / > Please let me know how we get started helping out.  I've just added Wind River as backup for this role.  Please watch for issues on which Oracle (and others) haven't provided an initial response to the reporter or where such response is incomplete (per the above), and provide your own response (CC'ing the list) whenever that happens.  > And, I have another point want to discuss.

And If it ca be defined as an contribution, we can take it. :-)  We've received some responses in this thread regarding the specific example above, but I'd like more general responses please.  Is there a general task Wind River can reasonably help with for getting CVE details published for issues that pass the distros and/or oss-security lists, and how exactly could they help with that?
