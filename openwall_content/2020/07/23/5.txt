One notable difference is you don't appear to have a maximum embargo time.  > Alban Crequy (CC'ed) who is on the team has had interactions (which > pre-date flatcar): > >  Oh, as I understand from your e-mail signature, Alban is one of your company's directors.

So unless you choose another second task for you (that doesn't already have two distros signed up for it), you'll initially be just a backup for "Check if related issues exist in ... other software", which is fine.  > The number of packages in distro is drastically reduced, and we'll be on > this.

OK.  It looks like we'll add Flatcar as soon as an existing member vouches for you.
