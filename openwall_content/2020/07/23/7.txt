This requirement is currently loosely specified as:  "Have someone already on the private list, or at least someone else who has been active on oss-security for years but is not affiliated with your distro nor your organization, vouch for at least one of the people requesting membership on behalf of your distro (then that one vouched-for person will be able to vouch for others on your team, in case you'd like multiple people subscribed)"  So someone who's on (linux-)distros "or at least someone else who has been active on oss-security for years but is not affiliated" should state in here that they vouch for Vincent.  They may optionally make this more specific (yet convincing) if they like, but that isn't required.
