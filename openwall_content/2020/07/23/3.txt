Most of the above is once again too specific to the given CVE ID, whereas we need a general understanding of whether the task Xiao proposes and volunteers for is worthwhile or not.  I'd appreciate a direct answer to that.  Do I interpret this paragraph correctly as implying the answer is no? -  > CNAs are provided with weekly reports by the root CNA: MITRE, which lists > Reserved But Public "RBP" CVEs owned by that CNA, irrespective of whether > the CVE was assigned on distros list or elsewhere. That closes the reminder > loop.  In other words, CNAs receive their reminders from MITRE weekly, so there's no need for anyone else reminding them, correct?  However, can it happen that MITRE wouldn't recognize a CVE ID as "Reserved But Public", continuing to treat it as merely reserved, in which case there would be no reminder to correct that?  Could Xiao help with this?  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
