The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * Jenkins * Jenkins LTS * Deployer Framework Plugin 1.3 * Gitlab Authentication Plugin 1.6 * Matrix Authorization Strategy Plugin * Matrix Project Plugin   Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  / Jenkins and earlier, LTS and earlier does not escape the agent name on build time trend pages. This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users with Agent/Configure permission.   / Jenkins and earlier, LTS and earlier does not escape the upstream job's display name shown as part of a build cause. This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users with Job/Configure permission.   / Jenkins and earlier, LTS and earlier does not escape the job name in the 'Keep this build forever' badge tooltip. This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure job names.  As job names do not generally support the character set needed for XSS, this is believed to be difficult to exploit in common configurations.   / Jenkins and earlier, LTS and earlier does not escape the `href` attribute of links to downstream jobs displayed in the build console page. This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users with Job/Configure permission.   / Matrix Project Plugin and earlier does not escape node names shown in tooltips on the overview page of builds with a single axis. This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users with Agent/Configure permission.   / Matrix Project Plugin and earlier does not escape the axis names shown in tooltips on the overview page of builds with multiple axes. This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users with Job/Configure permission.   / Matrix Authorization Strategy Plugin and earlier does not escape user names shown in the permission table. This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. When using project-based matrix authorization, this vulnerability can be exploited by a user with Job/Configure or Agent/Configure permission, otherwise by users with Overall/Administer permission.   / Deployer Framework Plugin is a framework plugin allowing other plugins to provide a way to deploy artifacts. Deployer Framework Plugin 1.2 and earlier does not escape the URL displayed in the build home page. This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to provide the location.  The exploitability of this vulnerability depends on the specific implementation using Deployer Framework Plugin. The Jenkins security team is not aware of any exploitable implementation.   / Gitlab Authentication Plugin 1.5 and earlier does not differentiate between user names and hierarchical group names when performing authorization. This allows an attacker with permissions to create groups in GitLab to gain the privileges granted to another user or group.
