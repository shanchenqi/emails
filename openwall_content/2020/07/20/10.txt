Seems only "the > CNA Hackerone" can make it. I have no idea on how to notify the "the CNA > Hackerone " to push it. :-(Â  Anyway, if possible we are glad to make it.  Once again, I think is more of an exception than the rule. I would be more interested in comments by "CVE experts" on whether the task Xiao proposes and volunteers for is in general worthwhile or not, and why.  Would similar "notify a vulnerability publication" reminders be desirable for issues that got the CVE IDs from one of the CNAs on the distros list?
