Yeah, I was doing the alternate character for a while. Then Perl came along and I could not figure out all the places it needed to be changed. They spray the rpath in more places than just Makefiles, and they build Makefiles on the fly. I found it's not a simple task to sed the alternate character back out after, say, configure.
