Also see  Building on Linux or Solaris with LDFLAGS that includes a rpath or runpath:      -Wl,-R,$ORIGIN/../lib -Wl,-R,$HOME/tmp/ok2delete/lib  results in a rpath or runpath similar to below (Solaris is shown):      # From directory     $ elfdump libperl.so | grep PATH     [10]  RUNPATH         0xaf4d /../lib:/export/home/jwalton/tmp/ok2delete/lib     [11]  RPATH           0xaf4d /../lib:/export/home/jwalton/tmp/ok2delete/lib  Now the interesting thing here is, $ORIGIN was expanded to nothing and /../lib is just /lib. And Solaris /lib directory contains old libraries, like zLib and Bzip zLib and Bzip have CVEs against them. So rather than use the new zLib and Bzip in $HOME/tmp/ok2delete/lib, Perl uses the old ones with CVEs in /lib.  Perl stated they won't fix the problem. Also see  The best workarounds I have found is to run patchelf (Linux) or editelf (Solaris) on all programs and libraries after 'make' and before 'make check', and after 'make check' and before 'make install'. The procedure has to happen twice because Perl rebuilds some things after 'make', including some shared objects built during 'make check'.  The problem with the workaround is, patchelf and editelf has limited availability. patchelf is buggy [1,2] and editelf is only available on Solaris 11 [3].
