I would still appreciate more comments by others.

Thanks.  Much of this looks convincing to me, but here are some comments:  > We have already been a participant on oss-security for some time and are > active in a number of communities. Glad to participate.  Vincent, as far as I could find, you personally have subscribed to oss-security 2 months ago, and I couldn't find anyone else from Flatcar Linux subscribed.  (Maybe people are with personal addresses that I didn't associate with Flatcar Linux.)  I also found only this one posting to Openwall lists by you:   This is good, but it's not a lot.  What I see on the Flatcar Linux website is more convincing, but maybe you can point us at specific examples of community participation by you personally and/or by others at Flatcar Linux?  > > Be able and willing to contribute back (see above), preferably in > specific ways announced in advance (so that you're responsible for a > specific area and so that we know what to expect from which member), and > demonstrate actual contributions once you've been a member for a while >  > There are a number of the items we will do through the course of normal > process (review, test, validate, monitor for issues going public).

As I recall other applications to join the linux-distros list since we introduced this contribute-back requirement, distros volunteered for some tasks right away, not "after being a member for a period."  What you say makes sense, but would be a deviation from the practice so far. I'd appreciate not needing to make an exception for you.  > Pat Volkerding can vouch for me (CC???ed), and maybe others, but I asked > volkerdi first :-)  We haven't yet heard from Pat Volkerding.  Given your LinkedIn profile, I guess someone from Red Hat could vouch for you as well.
