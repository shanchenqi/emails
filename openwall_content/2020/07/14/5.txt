Including issues like being addressed within days of other distros publicly exposing their patch for this embargoed issue.  > Not be (only) downstream or a rebuild of another distro (or else we need convincing additional justification of how the list membership would enable you to release fixes sooner, presumably not relying on the upstream distro having released their fixes first?)  Flatcar had been downstream of CoreOS Container Linux, but now is only downstream to aspects of Gentoo and ChromeOS, though manages its own components, build metadata, build infrastructure and update servers.  > Be a participant and preferably an active contributor in relevant public communities (most notably, if you're not watching for issues being made public on oss-security, which are a superset of those that had been handled on (linux-)distros, then there's no valid reason for you to be on (linux-)distros)  We have already been a participant on oss-security for some time and are active in a number of communities. Glad to participate.  > Accept the list policy (see above)  We accept.  > Be able and willing to contribute back (see above), preferably in specific ways announced in advance (so that you're responsible for a specific area and so that we know what to expect from which member), and demonstrate actual contributions once you've been a member for a while  There are a number of the items we will do through the course of normal process (review, test, validate, monitor for issues going public). As for owning or being a backup, I expect that would be a consideration after being a member for a period.  > Be able and willing to handle PGP-encrypted e-mail  Yes  > Have someone already on the private list, or at least someone else who has been active on oss-security for years but is not affiliated with your distro nor your organization, vouch for at least one of the people requesting membership on behalf of your distro (then that one vouched-for person will be able to vouch for others on your team, in case you'd like multiple people subscribed)  Pat Volkerding can vouch for me (CC’ed), and maybe others, but I asked volkerdi first :-)   vb   --   Vincent Batts  CTO   --- Kinvolk GmbH | Adalbertstr.6a, Berlin | tel: Geschäftsführer/Directors: Alban Crequy, Chris Kühl, Iago López Galeiras Registergericht/Court of registration: Amtsgericht Charlottenburg Registernummer/Registration number: HRB B Ust-ID-Nummer/VAT ID number:   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
