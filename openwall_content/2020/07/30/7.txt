Would this mean that the behavior of a program that compares  ld.so only needs to generate one plt entry for a function in a process and that entry can provided the canonical address that is loaded from some got entry when the address is used, so there is double indirection, but it works.  > function pointers obtained through different shared libraries might > change? > > I guess you could maybe canonicalize function pointers somehow, but > that'd probably at least break dlclose(), right?
