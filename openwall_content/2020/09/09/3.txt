Forget it."  There is also the odd "We won't run any software that doesn't have <some number of expensive independent code audits and certifications> and what you want to do doesn't have those (even though you claim they do, we think you're lying)."  > reuse of systems across distinct projects (contracts) within the agency and  Secure data erasure and platform disposal practices have something to do with this.  > there is nothing approaching a comprehensive way for a federal agency to > answer "did we deploy the updated struts for all of our stuff".  With a side order of "the contractors we hired for this stuff should be on top of it," even when they're not the prime on the contract anymore.
