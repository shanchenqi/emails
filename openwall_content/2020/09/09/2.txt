And then the kind accountants who perform the audits say, "Great policy, this is fully compliant, have an ATO and a gold star". And then random things all over the place are not patched at all because federal IT departments have astonishly poor automation practices, extremely limited reuse of systems across distinct projects (contracts) within the agency and there is nothing approaching a comprehensive way for a federal agency to answer "did we deploy the updated struts for all of our stuff".
