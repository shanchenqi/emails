Problem: A malicious guest can harm the host using vhost crypto, this includes executing code in host (VM Escape), reading host application memory space to guest and causing partially denial of service in the host.  All users of the vhost library are strongly encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible.  Thanks to "Ryan Hall <ryan.e.hall@...el.com>" for reporting the issues.
