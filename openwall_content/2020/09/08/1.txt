Yeah, I thought the same. I was hoping to see more about that comment.  Every US Federal agency I have worked with patches. The Social Security Administration does it within 30 days, and the Treasury Department does it in a matter of days. SSA is one of the largest networks in the world with over hosts. Treasury had over hosts.  Microsoft did a study years ago and found most hosts that are compromised failed to install vendor patches. Most patches were available at least 60 days earlier. The one takeaway is, if you want to get compromised, then don't patch the host. A script kiddie will be happy to pwn you.  I also got to rebuild a few servers that were compromised due to lack of updates. It is a lot easier to fix a broken database connection then it is to rebuild the server and restore the database. Diagnosing and fixing the database connection takes about 30 minutes. Rebuilding and restoring the server takes about two days.  I'm such a firm believer in patching from experiences at SSA and Treasury all machines under my control are patched immediately. I apply all patches in case something is misclassified. I don't care if it is a CVE or [benign?] memory error. I want the vector removed. https://github.com/noloader/auto-update.
