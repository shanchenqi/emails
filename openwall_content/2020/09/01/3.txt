The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * Build Failure Analyzer Plugin * Cadence vManager Plugin * database Plugin 1.7 * Git Parameter Plugin * Parameterized Remote Trigger Plugin * SoapUI Pro Functional Testing Plugin 1.4  Additionally, we announce unresolved security issues in the following plugins:  * JSGames Plugin * Klocwork Analysis Plugin * SoapUI Pro Functional Testing Plugin * Team Foundation Server Plugin * Valgrind Plugin  Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://www.jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  / Git Parameter Plugin and earlier does not escape the repository field on the 'Build with Parameters' page.  This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Job/Configure permission.   / Parameterized Remote Trigger Plugin and earlier stores a secret unencrypted in its global configuration file `org.jenkinsci.plugins.ParameterizedRemoteTrigger.RemoteBuildConfiguration.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration. This secret can be viewed by attackers with access to the Jenkins controller file system.   / database Plugin 1.6 and earlier does not require POST requests for the database console, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.  This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL scripts.   / (CSRF) & (permission check) database Plugin 1.6 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.  This allows attackers with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified database server using attacker-specified username and password.  Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.   / Cadence vManager Plugin and earlier does not escape build descriptions in tooltips.  This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Run/Update permission.   / Build Failure Analyzer Plugin and earlier does not escape matching text in a form validation response.  This results in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to provide console output for builds used to test build log indications.   / Valgrind Plugin and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.  This allows a user able to control the input files for the Valgrind plugin parser to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / Valgrind Plugin and earlier does not escape content in Valgrind XML reports.  This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control Valgrind XML report contents.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / Klocwork Analysis Plugin and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.  This allows a user able to control the input files for the Klocwork plugin parser to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / JSGames Plugin 0.2 and earlier evaluates part of a URL as code.  This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / Team Foundation Server Plugin and earlier stores a webhook secret unencrypted in its global configuration file `hudson.plugins.tfs.TeamPluginGlobalConfig.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration. This secret can be viewed by attackers with access to the Jenkins controller file system.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   (1) / SoapUI Pro Functional Testing Plugin 1.3 and earlier stores project passwords unencrypted in job `config.xml` files as part of its configuration. These project passwords can be viewed by attackers with Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.   (2) / SoapUI Pro Functional Testing Plugin stores project passwords in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.  While these passwords are stored encrypted on disk since SoapUI Pro Functional Testing Plugin 1.4, they are transmitted in plain text as part of the global configuration form by SoapUI Pro Functional Testing Plugin 1.5 and earlier. These passwords can be viewed by attackers with Extended Read permission.  This only affects Jenkins before including LTS, as Jenkins introduces a security hardening that transparently encrypts and decrypts data used for a Jenkins password form field.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.     Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
