We encourage all users of Django to upgrade as soon as possible.  Incorrect permissions on intermediate-level directories on Python 3.7+ ======================================================================================  On Python 3.7+, ``FILE_UPLOAD_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS`` mode was not applied to intermediate-level directories created in the process of uploading files and to intermediate-level collected static directories when using the ``collectstatic`` management command.  You should review and manually fix permissions on existing intermediate-level directories.  Permission escalation in intermediate-level directories of the file system cache on Python 3.7+ ===============================================================================================================  On Python 3.7+, the intermediate-level directories of the file system cache had the system's standard umask rather than (no group or others permissions).  Affected supported versions ===========================  * Django master branch * Django 3.1 * Django 3.0 * Django 2.2  Resolution ==========  Patches to resolve the issue have been applied to Django's master branch and the 3.1, 3.0, and 2.2 release branches. The patches may be obtained from the following changesets:   * On the `master branch * On the `3.1 release branch * On the `3.0 release branch * On the `2.2 release branch   * On the `master branch * On the `3.1 release branch * On the `3.0 release branch * On the `2.2 release branch  The following releases have been issued:  * Django (`download Django | checksums * Django (`download Django | checksums * Django (`download Django | checksums  The PGP key ID used for these releases is Carlton Gibson:  General notes regarding security reporting ==========================================  As always, we ask that potential security issues be reported via private email to ``security@...ngoproject.com``, and not via Django's Trac instance or the django-developers list.
