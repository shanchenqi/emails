Gday,  A flaw was found in the Linux kernels implementation of biovec usage.  A zero-length biovec request issued to the block subsystem could cause the kernel to enter an infinite loop causing a denial of service. An attacker with a local account can issue requests to a block device can cause a denial of service.
