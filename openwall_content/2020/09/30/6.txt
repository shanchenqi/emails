Unfortunately the fixcrlf task deleted the temporary file and created a new one without said protection, effectively nullifying the effort.  This would still allow an attacker to inject modified source files into the build process.  Mitigation:  The best mitigation against and still is to make Ant use a directory that is only readable and writable by the current user.  Ant users of versions and can use the Ant property ant.tmpdir to point to such a directory, users of versions 1.1 to and to should set the java.io.tmpdir system property.  Ant will also try to create a temporary directory only accessible by the current user if neither of the properties above is set but may fail to create one if the underlying filesystem doesn't allow it.  Explicitly setting up a directory to use and set the respective property is the only mitigation that will work on every platform.
