QEMU: fdc: null pointer dereference during r/w data transfer  A null pointer dereference issue was found in the Floppy disk emulator of  QEMU. It could occur while transferring data via fdctrl_read_data(),  fdctrl_write_data() routines, if current drive has a null block pointer. A  guest may use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host resulting in DoS  scenario.  References: -----------    ->    -> ===  2. QEMU: scsi: lsi: null pointer dereference during memory move  A null pointer dereference issue was found in the SCSI Host Bus  Adapter emulator of QEMU. It could occur while processing 'Memory Move'  instructions to move data between dma memory and i/o address space via  lsi_memcpy(). A guest user/process may use this flaw to crash the QEMU process  resulting in DoS scenario.  References: -----------    ->    -> ===   3. QEMU: ide: null pointer dereference while cancelling i/o operation  A null pointer dereference issue was found in the IDE disk emulator of QEMU.  It could occur while cancelling an i/o operation via ide_cancel_dma_sync()  routine, if a block drive pointer is null. A guest may use this flaw to crash  the QEMU process on the host resulting in DoS scenario.
