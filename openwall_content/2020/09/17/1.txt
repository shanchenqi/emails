It could occur while servicing OHCI isochronous transfer descriptors (TD) in  ohci_service_iso_td routine, as it retires a TD if it has passed its time  frame. While doing so it does not check if the TD was already processed ones  and holds an error code in TD_CC. It may happen if the TD list has a loop.  A guest user/process may use this flaw to consume cpu cycles on the host  resulting in a DoS scenario.
