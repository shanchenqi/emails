My two cents - Patch everything is far from reality to most (read all) organizations and I would argue that it's not a solution per se. To me it looks like buying every type of vehicle for commuting in every city of the world but we don't do that, rather we decide what will work best depending on factors like traffic, distance, roads, weather etc.  I believe prioritization is an integral part of everything we do and it works as reasoning to what we do (or don't).
