ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The so called 2-level event channel model imposes different limits on the number of usable event channels for 32-bit x86 domains vs 64-bit or Arm (either bitness) ones.  32-bit x86 domains can use only channels, due to limited space in their shared (between guest and Xen) information structure, whereas all other domains can use up to in this model.  The recording of the respective limit during domain initialization, however, has occurred at a time where domains are still deemed to be 64-bit ones, prior to actually honoring respective domain properties.  At the point domains get recognized as 32-bit ones, the limit didn't get updated accordingly.  Due to this misbehavior in Xen, 32-bit domains (including Domain 0) servicing other domains may observe event channel allocations to succeed when they should really fail.  Subsequent use of such event channels would then possibly lead to corruption of other parts of the shared info structure.  IMPACT ======  An unprivileged guest may cause another domain, in particular Domain 0, to misbehave.  This may lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) for the entire system.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen versions from 4.4 onwards are vulnerable.  Xen versions 4.3 and earlier are not vulnerable.  Only x86 32-bit domains servicing other domains are vulnerable.  Arm systems as well as x86 64-bit domains are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  There is no known workaround for x86 32-bit Domain 0.  The problem can be avoided by reducing the number of event channels available to 32-bit x86 guests to no more than  For example, setting in the xl domain configuration, or deleting any existing setting (since is the default for xl/libxl).  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Julien Grall of Amazon.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.  Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
