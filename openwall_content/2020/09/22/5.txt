ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Logic in the handling of event channel operations in Xen assumes that an event channel, once valid, will not become invalid over the life time of a guest.  However, operations like the resetting of all event channels may involve decreasing one of the bounds checked when determining validity.  This may lead to bug checks triggering, crashing the host.  IMPACT ======  An unprivileged guest may be able to crash Xen, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) for the entire system.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen versions from 4.4 onwards are vulnerable.  Xen versions 4.3 and earlier are not vulnerable.  Only systems with untrusted guests permitted to create more than the default number of event channels are vulnerable.  This number depends on the architecture and type of guest.  For 32-bit x86 PV guests, this is for 64-bit x86 PV guests, and for all ARM guests, this number is  Systems where untrusted guests are limited to fewer than this number are not vulnerable.  Note that xl and libxl limit max_event_channels to by default, so systems using exlusively xl, libvirt+libxl, or their own toolstack based on libxl, and not explicitly setting max_event_channels, are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  The problem can be avoided by reducing the number of event channels available to the guest to no more than  For example, setting in the xl domain configuration, or deleting any existing setting (since is the default for xl/libxl).  For ARM systems, any limit no more than is safe.  For 64-bit x86 PV guests, any limit no more than is likewise safe if the host configuration prevents the guest administrator from substituting and running a 32-bit kernel (and thereby putting the guest into 32-bit PV mode).  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.  Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.            Xen - xen-unstable  $   $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the *patch* described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  And: deployment of the event channel limit reduction mitigation is NOT permitted (except where all the affected systems and VMs are administered and used only by organisations which are members of the Xen Project Security Issues Predisclosure List).  Specifically, deployment on public cloud systems is NOT permitted.  This is because such a change can be visible to the guest, so it would leak the preconditions for the vulnerability and maybe lead to rediscovery.  Deployment of this, or similar mitigations, is permitted only AFTER the embargo ends.  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
