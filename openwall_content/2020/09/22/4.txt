ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The RCU (Read, Copy, Update) mechanism is a synchronisation primitive.  A buggy error path in the XENMEM_acquire_resource exits without releasing an RCU reference, which is conceptually similar to forgetting to unlock a spinlock.  IMPACT ======  A buggy or malicious HVM stubdomain can cause an RCU reference to be leaked.  This causes subsequent administration operations, (e.g. CPU offline) to livelock, resulting in a host Denial of Service.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  The buggy codepath has been present since Xen  Xen and later are vulnerable to the DoS.  The side effects are believed to be benign on Xen and but patches are provided nevertheless.  The vulnerability can generally only be exploited by x86 HVM VMs, as these are generally the only type of VM which have a Qemu stubdomain. x86 PV and PVH domains, as well as ARM VMs typically don't use a stubdomain.  Only VMs using HVM stubdomains can exploit the vulnerability.  VMs using PV stubdomains, or with emulators running in dom0 cannot exploit the vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only x86 PV or PVH VMs will avoid the vulnerability. Reconfiguring x86 HVM guests to use a PV or no stubdom will also avoid the vulnerability.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Andrew Cooper of Citrix.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.  Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.            Xen - xen-unstable      Xen  $    $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.   (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
