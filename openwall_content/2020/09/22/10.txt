Adjust affect versions.  Public release.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Uses of EVTCHNOP_reset (potentially by a guest on itself) or XEN_DOMCTL_soft_reset (by itself covered by XSA-77) can lead to the violation of various internal assumptions.  This may lead to out of bounds memory accesses or triggering of bug checks.  IMPACT ======  In particular x86 PV guests may be able to elevate their privilege to that of the host.  Host and guest crashes are also possible, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).  Information leaks cannot be ruled out.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen versions from 4.5 onwards are vulnerable.  Xen versions 4.4 and earlier are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  There is no known mitigation.  CREDITS =======  Different aspects of this issue were discovered by Julien Grall of Amazon and by Jan Beulich of SUSE.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate set of attached patches resolves this issue.  Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
