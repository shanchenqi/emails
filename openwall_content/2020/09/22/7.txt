ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  In particular the FIFO event channel model allows guests to have a large number of event channels active at a time.  Closing all of these when resetting all event channels or when cleaning up after the guest may take extended periods of time.  So far there was no arrangement for preemption at suitable intervals, allowing a CPU to spend an almost unbounded amount of time in the processing of these operations.  IMPACT ======  Malicious or buggy guest kernels can mount a Denial of Service (DoS) attack affecting the entire system.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen versions are vulnerable in principle.  Whether versions 4.3 and older are vulnerable depends on underlying hardware characteristics.  MITIGATION ==========  The problem can be avoided by reducing the number of event channels available to all guests to a suitably low limit.  For example, setting in the xl domain configurations may be low enough for all hardware Xen is able to run on.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate set of attached patches resolves this issue.  Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
