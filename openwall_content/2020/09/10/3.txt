By passing an empty environment map to RMIConnectorServer, instead of the map that contains he authentication credentials, it leaves ActiveMQ open to the following attack:   https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html  "A remote client could create a javax.management.loading.MLet MBean and use it to create new MBeans from arbitrary URLs, at least if there is no security manager. In other words, a rogue remote client could make your Java application execute arbitrary code."
