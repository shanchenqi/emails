It is possible to connect to the registry without authentication and call the rebind method to rebind jmxrmi to something else. If an attacker creates another server to proxy the original, and bound that, he effectively becomes a  man in the middle and is able to intercept the credentials when an user connects.  Mitigation: Upgrade to Apache ActiveMQ  Credit: Jonathan Gallimore & Colm O hEigeartaigh    Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
