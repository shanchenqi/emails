The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * Blue Ocean Plugin * computer-queue-plugin Plugin 1.6 * Email Extension Plugin * Health Advisor by CloudBees Plugin * Mailer Plugin * Perfecto Plugin * Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin * Validating String Parameter Plugin 2.5  Additionally, we announce unresolved security issues in the following plugins:  * Android Lint Plugin * chosen-views-tabbar Plugin * ClearCase Release Plugin * Copy data to workspace Plugin * Coverage/Complexity Scatter Plot Plugin * Custom Job Icon Plugin * Description Column Plugin * ElasTest Plugin * Locked Files Report Plugin * MongoDB Plugin * Radiator View Plugin * Selection tasks Plugin * Storable Configs Plugin  Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://www.jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  / Mailer Plugin and earlier does not perform hostname validation when connecting to the configured SMTP server. This lack of validation could be abused using a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept these connections.   / Email Extension Plugin and earlier does not perform hostname validation when connecting to the configured SMTP server. This lack of validation could be abused using a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept these connections.   / Blue Ocean Plugin and earlier provides an undocumented feature flag, `blueocean.features.GIT_READ_SAVE_TYPE`, that when set to the value `clone` allows an attacker with Item/Configure or Item/Create permission to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system.   / A missing permission check in a REST API in Blue Ocean Plugin and earlier allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified URL.   / Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin and earlier does not escape the upstream job's display name shown as part of a build cause.  This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Job/Configure permission.   / Validating String Parameter Plugin 2.4 and earlier does not escape regular expressions in tooltips. Additionally, Validating String Parameter Plugin 2.4 does not escape parameter names and parameter descriptions.  This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Job/Configure permission.   / Health Advisor by CloudBees Plugin and earlier does not correctly perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.  This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to view an administrative configuration page.   / computer-queue-plugin Plugin 1.5 and earlier does not escape the agent name in tooltips.  This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Agent/Configure permission.   / Perfecto Plugin and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing a connection test.  This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified HTTP URL using attacker-specified username and password.   / Perfecto Plugin allows specifying Perfecto Connect Path and Perfecto Connect File Name in job configurations.  This command is executed on the Jenkins controller in Perfecto Plugin and earlier, allowing attackers with Job/Configure permission to run arbitrary commands on the Jenkins controller.   / Android Lint Plugin 2.6 and earlier does not escape the annotation message in tooltips.  This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to provide report files to the 'Publish Android Lint results' post-build step.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / Radiator View Plugin and earlier does not escape the full name of the jobs in tooltips.  This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Job/Configure permission.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / Custom Job Icon Plugin 0.2 and earlier does not escape the job descriptions in tooltips.  This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Job/Configure permission.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / Coverage/Complexity Scatter Plot Plugin and earlier does not escape the method information in tooltips.  This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to provide report files to the 'Publish Coverage / Complexity Scatter Plot' post-build step.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / Description Column Plugin 1.3 and earlier does not escape the job description in the column tooltips.  This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Job/Configure permission.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / (missing permission check) & (CSRF) MongoDB Plugin 1.3 and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods implementing form validation.  This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to gain access to some metadata of any arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller.  Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / chosen-views-tabbar Plugin 1.2 and earlier does not escape view names in the dropdown to select views.  This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with the ability to configure views.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / ClearCase Release Plugin 0.3 and earlier does not escape the composite baseline in badge tooltip.  This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Job/Configure permission.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / Locked Files Report Plugin 1.6 and earlier does not escape locked files' names in tooltips.  This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Job/Configure permission.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / (missing permission check) & (CSRF) ElasTest Plugin and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.  This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials.  Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / ElasTest Plugin and earlier stores its server password in plain text in the global configuration file `jenkins.plugins.elastest.ElasTestInstallation.xml`. This password can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / Copy data to workspace Plugin allows users to copy files from the Jenkins controller to job workspaces.  Copy data to workspace Plugin 1.0 and earlier does not limit which directories can be copied. This allows attackers with Job/Configure permission to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / Selection tasks Plugin implements a job parameter that dynamically generates possible values from the output of a program. The path to that program is specified as part of the parameter configuration.  Selection tasks Plugin 1.0 and earlier executes this user-specified program on the Jenkins controller. This allows attackers with Job/Configure permission to execute an arbitrary system command on the Jenkins controller as the OS user that the Jenkins process is running as.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   (1) / Storable Configs Plugin 1.0 and earlier allows users with Job/Read permission to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   (2) / Storable Configs Plugin allows storing copies of a job's `config.xml` file on the Jenkins controller with a user-specified file name.  Storable Configs Plugin 1.0 and earlier does not restrict the user-specified file name, except that a `.xml` suffix is added if it's not already present. This allows attackers with Job/Configure permission to replace any other `.xml` file on the Jenkins controller with the job's `config.xml` file's content.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix. Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
