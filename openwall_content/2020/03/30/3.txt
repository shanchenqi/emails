This was introduced in commit:    ("bpf: Provide better register bounds after jmp32 instructions")  The result is that register bounds were improperly calculated, allowing out-of-bounds reads and writes to occur.  This issue affects 5.5 kernels, and was backported to 5.4-stable as The Linux kernel bpf maintainers recommend reverting the patch for stable releases:     This bpf functionality is available to unprivileged users unless the kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled sysctl is set to 1.
