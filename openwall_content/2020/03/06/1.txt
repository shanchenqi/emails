Once the quota level has been reached, a bug in TCP client quota enforcement can lead to servers improperly refusing additional TCP connections even after the number of current TCP clients drops back below the quota level.  The defect only affects BIND and a few of the final releases in the BIND development branch through and does not interfere with UDP queries -- a server which hits this bug will stop accepting new TCP connections but will continue processing UDP traffic.  Because the majority of query traffic is not affected we have assessed the severity level of this bug as not high enough to require a CVE identifier assignment and a special security software release -- but still significant enough that operators ought to be informed about it, therefore we are issuing the BIND Operational Notification that follows.  If you have any further questions after reading the Operational Notification below, please contact security-officer@....org and we will attempt to answer them.  Once again, BIND is the only stable production release version that is affected; a few versions of the unstable development were affected as well (see below for exact details.)  Michael McNally ISC Security Officer   - ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Posting date:       05 March Program Impacted:   BIND Versions affected:  Also versions -> of the                     development branch.  Description:     One part of the development work done in the BIND branch    was to modernize BIND's networking framework to use libuv, a    multi-platform C library that provides support for asynchronous    I/O based on event loops.     Unfortunately, during this work we introduced a problem in    enforcing TCP client quota limits. A discrepancy in our quota    code can result in a situation where the count is not properly    decremented in some cases.  Impact:     Under some circumstances, especially if a server is accepting    TCP connections from clients on multiple interfaces, once the    quota has been reached the server may stop accepting new TCP    connections even after the number of active TCP connections has    fallen back below the quota limit.     Servers which encounter this defect will continue accepting and    processing UDP queries (which represent the majority of query    traffic on most servers) but can lose the ability to accept new    TCP connections until the server is restarted.  Workarounds:     To avoid reaching this condition accidentally the operator of    an affected server can provision the tcp-clients limit high    enough so that it is not expected to be encountered in normal    operation. However a malicious party could still succeed in    triggering it deliberately.  Solution:     Since the workaround listed above is not effective against    deliberate exploitation ISC recommends that operators running    an affected release of BIND either:     -  Download a patch diff (from       apply it to the source code using the patch utility,       and recompile to include the behavior fix which will be included       in the next release of the branch to prevent this defect,     -or-     -  Revert to a stable production release of BIND from a branch       before the libuv networking restructuring introduced in       At the present time our supported release branches are       (most recent release: and (most recent release:  Acknowledgements:     ISC would like to thank Jay Ford of the University of Iowa for    reporting this issue.
