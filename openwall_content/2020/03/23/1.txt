My bug report to s9y [1]:  The version number shown in the update notification window is not escaped. This means it can contain javascript payload and thus allow XSS.  The version information is fetched from a Github URL, which means this is an XSS vulnerability that can only be exploited by the serendipity developers or github itself. So this makes it rather low severity.  Still I'd consider safety against the developers or potentially compromised developer accounts desirable where possible, and this seems easy to fix.  PoC: Change the $updateURL variable in include/functions_installer.inc.php in the function serendipity_getCurrentVersion to one you control and add something like:  stable:9.<img src=x onerror=alert(1)><x beta:9.<img src=x onerror=alert(2)><x  (s9y adds a </span> somewhere at the end for reasons I don't understand, by adding the bogus <x I avoid that disturbing my payload.)
