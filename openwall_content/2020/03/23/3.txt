If an attacker can make an authorized resource request to an unpatched API server (see below), then you may be vulnerable to If an attacker can make an authorized request to an unpatched kubelet, then you may be vulnerable to <https://github.com/kubernetes/security/blob/master/comms-temlpates/vulnerability-announcement-email.md#affected-versions>Affected Versions affects:     - kubelet -    - kubelet -    - kubelet -    - *kubelets prior to are unaffected*  affects:     - kube-apiserver -    - kube-apiserver -    - kube-apiserver <  <https://github.com/kubernetes/security/blob/master/comms-temlpates/vulnerability-announcement-email.md#how-do-i-mitigate-this-vulnerability>How do I mitigate this vulnerability?  Prior to upgrading, these vulnerabilities can be mitigated by:     - Preventing unauthenticated or unauthorized access to the affected    components    - The apiserver and kubelet should auto restart in the event of an OOM    error  <https://github.com/kubernetes/security/blob/master/comms-temlpates/vulnerability-announcement-email.md#fixed-versions>Fixed Versions Both vulnerabilities are patched in kubernetes versions     -    -    -  To upgrade, refer to the documentation: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/cluster-management/#upgrading-a-cluster <https://github.com/kubernetes/security/blob/master/comms-temlpates/vulnerability-announcement-email.md#addiitonal-details>Additional Details  See the GitHub issues for more details:   Thank You,  Tim Allclair on behalf of the Kubernetes Product Security Committee   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
