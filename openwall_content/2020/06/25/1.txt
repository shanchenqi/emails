I would like to request a CVE for the following vulnerability:  Summary -------  Damian Poddebniak discovered a TLS verification failure in  Trojitรก [1], a fast Qt IMAP e-mail client. When sending e-mails over SMTP,  all TLS errors were ignored.  Background ----------  Trojita first gained support for SMTP submission in patch [2].  Since that commit (May there's been a FIXME comment in the code that  SSL errors should be handled properly. Unfortunately, this issue kept  falling through the cracks and we never re-enabled TLS validation as the  SMTP backend matured. As a result, outgoing SMTP connections were  suspectible to a MITM attack, with authentication details including  passwords and the message content potentially available to attackers.  IMAP connections are not suspectible to this bug.  Affected versions -----------------  All versions of Trojita up to and including v0.7 are affected. The fix [3]  will be included in version v0.8 which will be released once the CVE gets  assigned.  Acknowledgement ---------------  Thanks to Damian Poddebniak for reporting [4] this bug.  [1] http://trojita.flaska.net/ [2] [3] [4]  With kind regards, Jan  --  Trojitรก, a fast Qt IMAP e-mail client -- http://trojita.flaska.net/  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
