The vulnerability is related to the injection of HTTP headers via a CORS ExposeHeader tag. The newline character in the ExposeHeader tag in the CORS configuration file generates a header injection in the response when the CORS request is made. This issue affects the RadosGW S3 API, it does not affect the Swift API.  This flaw affects Nautilus and Octopus based versions. Red Hat has assigned and rated it as Moderate impact flaw.  PR:  Patch: The fix will be included in the Octopus version in the coming days.
