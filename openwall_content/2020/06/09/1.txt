It could occur when a  nbd-client sends a spec-compliant request that is near the boundary of the  maximum permitted length. A remote user/process could use this flaw to crash  the qemu-nbd server resulting in DoS.  Upstream patch: ---------------    ->  Issue introduced since QEMU v4.2    ->      server:      - Adjust things to allow full 4k name limit rather than previous byte        limit       - It allowed nbd-client to send longer bytes) export names  This issue was reported by Eric Blake and Xueqiang Wei of Red Hat Inc.
