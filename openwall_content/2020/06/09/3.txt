Please see (MDS) and (TAA) for details.  Certain processor operations microarchitecturally need to read data from outside the physical core (e.g. to communicate with the random number generator).  In some implementations, this operation is called a Special Register Read.  In some implementations, data are staged in a single shared buffer, and a full cache line at a time is returned to the core which made the Special Register Read.  On parts vulnerable to MFBDS or TAA, an attacker may be able to access stale data requested by other cores in the system.  For more details, see:    IMPACT ======  An attacker, which could include a malicious untrusted user process on a trusted guest, or an untrusted guest, can sample the contents of certain off-core accesses by other cores in the system.  This can include data whose use may depend on the secrecy of the value, such as data from the Random Number Generator (e.g. RDRAND/RDSEED instructions).  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Systems running all versions of Xen are affected.  Only x86 processors are vulnerable. ARM processors are not believed to be vulnerable.  Only Intel based processors are affected.  Processors from other manufacturers (e.g. AMD) are not believed to be vulnerable.  Please consult the Intel Security Advisory for details on the affected processors.  MITIGATION ==========  There is no mitigation available.  RESOLUTION ==========  New microcode is being released on affected parts to work around the vulnerability.  It may be available via a firmware update (consult your hardware vendor), or available for OS loading (consult your dom0 OS vendor).  On Xen and later, OS microcode can be loaded at runtime. See https://xenbits.xen.org/docs/latest/admin-guide/microcode-loading.html#runtime-microcode-loading for details on the xen-ucode utility.  Loading the microcode, either at boot or at runtime, suffices to mitigate the issue, as protections are active by default.  The mitigations do have an impact on latency of individual RDRAND/RDSEED instructions.  The patches below are for Xen, and offer boot time information, defaults selection, and opt-out controls.  They are recommended to take, but not absolutely necessary for protection.  Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.         xen-unstable   Xen   Xen   Xen   Xen    Xen 4.9.x  $             $  NOTE REGARDING LACK OF EMBARGO ==============================  Despite an attempt to organise predisclosure, the discoverers ultimately did not authorise a predisclosure. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----  =w+E7 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
