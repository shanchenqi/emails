This bug was already fixed in the Linux LTS kernels 17 months ago:  Linux Linux Linux Linux  Linux distributors can significantly reduce their vulnerability to known bugs by periodically merging in the appropriate LTS kernel branch.  Also, a regression test for this bug was added to LTP (Linux Test Project) 14 months ago: Based on what I've seen when adding regression tests to LTP before, it's likely that this bug was finally found and fixed in this particular downstream kernel only because the LTP test was failing.  However, note that most Linux kernel bugs are fixed without a regression test being added to LTP, which means that cherry-picking kernel patches to fix LTP failures is much less effective than merging in all LTS kernel fixes.  - Eric  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
