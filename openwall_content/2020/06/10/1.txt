Listed below are the CVE's that Red Hat has assigned.  As far as I can tell there are no existing  CVE assignments for these flaws. I have not done adequate investigation to correctly identify affected versions of the kernel, however this is a flaw in the fix for affected systems would likely be affected by the flaws listed below if they required the fix.  - Rogue cross-process SSBD shutdown. Linux scheduler logical bug allows an attacker to turn off the SSBD protection.  - Indirect Branch Prediction Barrier is force-disabled when STIBP is unavailable or enhanced IBRS is available.  -  Indirect branch speculation can be enabled after it was force-disabled by the PR_SPEC_FORCE_DISABLE prctl command.  The Red Hat Bugzillas for these flaws are   These  bugzillas are a work in progress and will be updated as I get more time to correctly input adequate information.
