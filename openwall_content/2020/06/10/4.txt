The kernel does NOT want to become a CVE Numbering Authority, and our documentation explicitly states that if you want a CVE for a kernel issue, you can just go ask MITRE or someone else for it: 	https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/security-bugs.html  There's loads of reasons why CVEs don't really work for the kernel at all, as has been discussed many times here on this list, and in other places, and even with MITRE themselves (and they agree with me).  I don't think we want to rehash that again here :)  thanks,  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
