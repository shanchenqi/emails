The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * Compact Columns Plugin * ECharts API Plugin * Script Security Plugin * Self-Organizing Swarm Plug-in Modules Plugin  Additionally, we announce unresolved security issues in the following plugins:  * Play Framework Plugin * Project Inheritance Plugin * Selenium Plugin * Subversion Partial Release Manager Plugin  Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  / Script Security Plugin and earlier does not correctly escape pending or approved classpath entries on the In-process Script Approval page.  This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure sandboxed scripts.   / (permission checks) & (CSRF) Self-Organizing Swarm Plug-in Modules Plugin adds API endpoints to add or remove agent labels. In Self-Organizing Swarm Plug-in Modules Plugin and earlier these only require a global Swarm secret to use, and no regular permission check is performed. This allows users with Agent/Create permission to add or remove labels of any agent.  Additionally, these API endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.   / ECharts API Plugin and earlier does not escape the parser identifier when rendering charts.  This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited by users with Job/Configure permission.   / ECharts API Plugin and earlier does not escape the display name of the builds in the trend chart.  This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited by users with Run/Update permission.   / Compact Columns Plugin and earlier displays the unprocessed job description in tooltips.  This results in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability that can be exploited by users with Job/Configure permission.   / Selenium Plugin and earlier has no CSRF protection for its HTTP endpoints.  This allows attackers to perform the following actions:  * Restart the Selenium Grid hub. * Delete or replace the plugin configuration. * Start, stop, or restart Selenium configurations on specific nodes.  Through carefully chosen configuration parameters, these actions can result in OS command injection on the Jenkins master.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / (permission check) & (unredacted encrypted secrets) Jenkins limits access to job configuration XML data (`config.xml`) to users with Job/ExtendedRead permission, typically implied by Job/Configure permission. Project Inheritance Plugin has several job inspection features, including the API URL `/job/.../getConfigAsXML` for its Inheritance Project job type that does something similar.  Project Inheritance Plugin and earlier does not check permissions for this new endpoint, granting access to job configuration XML data to every user with Job/Read permission.  Additionally, the encrypted values of secrets stored in the job configuration are not redacted, as they would be by the `config.xml` API for users without Job/Configure permission.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / Subversion Partial Release Manager Plugin and earlier does not escape the error message for the repository URL field form validation.  This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can also be exploited similar to a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability by users with Job/Configure permission.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / A form validation endpoint in Play Framework Plugin executes the `play` command to validate a given input file.  Play Framework Plugin and earlier lets users specify the path to the `play` command on the Jenkins master. This results in an OS command injection vulnerability exploitable by users able to store such a file on the Jenkins master (e.g. through archiving artifacts).  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.    Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
