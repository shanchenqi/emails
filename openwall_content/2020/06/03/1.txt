We encourage all users of Django to upgrade as soon as possible.  Potential data leakage via malformed memcached keys ===================================================================  In cases where a memcached backend does not perform key validation, passing malformed cache keys could result in a key collision, and potential data leakage. In order to avoid this vulnerability, key validation is added to the memcached cache backends.  Thank you to Dan Palmer for the report and patch.  Possible XSS via admin ``ForeignKeyRawIdWidget`` ================================================================  Query parameters for the admin ``ForeignKeyRawIdWidget`` were not properly URL encoded, posing an XSS attack vector. ``ForeignKeyRawIdWidget`` now ensures query parameters are correctly URL encoded.
