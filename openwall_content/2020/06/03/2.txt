Description: Apache Ignite uses H2 database to build SQL distributed execution engine. H2 provides SQL functions which could be used by attacker to access to a filesystem.  Mitigation: Ignite 2.8 or earlier users should upgrade to In case SQL is not used at all the issue could be mitigated by removing ignite-indexing.jar from Ignite classpath Risk could be partially mitigated by using non privileged user to start Apache Ignite.
