This issue has been rated medium ( CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N and assigned Am I vulnerable?  You may be vulnerable if:     -     You are running a vulnerable version (see below);    -     There are unprotected endpoints normally only visible from the    Kubernetes master (including link-local metadata endpoints, unauthenticated    services listening on localhost, or other services in the master's private    network); and    -     Untrusted users can create pods with an affected volume type or modify    storage classes.  Affected Versions     -     kube-controller-manager    -     kube-controller-manager -    -     kube-controller-manager -    -     kube-controller-manager <  The affected volume types are: GlusterFS, Quobyte, StorageFS, ScaleIO How do I mitigate this vulnerability?  Prior to upgrading, this vulnerability can be mitigated by adding endpoint protections on the master or restricting usage of the vulnerable volume types (for example by constraining usage with a PodSecurityPolicy <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#volumes-and-file-systems> or third-party admission controller such as Gatekeeper <https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper>) and restricting StorageClass write permissions through RBAC. Fixed Versions  The information leak was patched in the following versions:     -     kube-controller-manager    -     kube-controller-manager    -     kube-controller-manager    -     kube-controller-manager  To upgrade, refer to the documentation: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/cluster-management/#upgrading-a-cluster  Further work to protect against SSRF is underway and will be included in an upcoming patch release (details to follow).
