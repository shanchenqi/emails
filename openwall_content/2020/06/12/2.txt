By default, only an "admin" can actually invoke on an MBean. However there is a vulnerability there for someone who is not an admin, but has a "viewer" role. In the 'etc/jmx.acl.cfg', such as role can call get*. This leaves it partially vulnerable to this attack:  https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html  "A remote client could create a javax.management.loading.MLet MBean and use it to create new MBeans from arbitrary URLs, at least if there is no security manager. In other words, a rogue remote client could make your Java application execute arbitrary code."  It's possible to authenticate as a viewer role + invokes on the MLet getMBeansFromURL method, which goes off to a remote server to fetch the desired MBean, which is then registered in Karaf. At this point the attack fails as "viewer" doesn't have the permission to invoke on the MBean. Still, it could act as a SSRF style attack and also it essentially allows a "viewer" role to pollute the MBean registry, which is a kind of privilege escalation.   The vulnerability is low as it's possible to add a ACL to limit access.  This has been fixed in revision:   Mitigation: Apache Karaf users should upgrade to or later as soon as possible, or a new JMX ACL in etc configuration.
