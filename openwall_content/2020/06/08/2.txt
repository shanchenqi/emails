Such issues could allow a device connected to the local network (i.e., a device that has been authorized to transmit packets in the network in which the AP is located) could trigger the AP to initiate a HTTP (TCP/IP) connection to an arbitrary URL, including connections to servers in external networks. This could have a security implication if traffic from the local network to external destinations have different rules (e.g., firewall and packet inspection) for different local hosts and the AP having access to external hosts while the attacker controlled local device not having such access. Such deployment cases may not be common for networks where WPS would be enabled, but it is not possible to completely rule out the applicability to cases where hostapd is used to control a WPS enabled AP.  In addition to the more generic issues with the UPnP protocol, couple of implementation specific issues in hostapd were discovered while reviewing this area of the WPS implementation. These issues could allow local devices (i.e., devices that have been authorized to transmit packets in the network in which the AP is located) to trigger misbehavior in hostapd and cause the process to either get terminated or to start using more CPU resources by using a specially constructed SUBSCRIBE command.  All these issues require the attacker to be able to discover the UPnP service provided by hostapd and to open a TCP connection toward the IP address of the AP. The former requires access to the local network to be able to receive broadcast packets and the latter requires access to initiate TCP/IP connection to the IP address used by the AP. In most common AP deployment cases, both of these operations are available only from the local network.   Vulnerable versions/configurations  All hostapd versions with WPS AP support with UPnP enabled in the build parameters (CONFIG_WPS_UPNP=y) and in the runtime configuration (upnp_iface).   Possible mitigation steps  - Disable WPS UPnP support in the hostapd runtime configuration by   removing the upnp_iface parameter.  - Merge the following commits to hostapd and rebuild:    For   WPS UPnP: Do not allow event subscriptions with URLs to other networks   For the other issues:   WPS UPnP: Fix event message generation using a long URL path   WPS UPnP: Handle HTTP initiation failures for events more properly    These patches are available from  - Update to hostapd or newer, once available  --  Jouni Malinen                                            PGP id  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
