The secrets get logged at DEBUG loglevel.  pam_tacplus avoids the logging of the secret, via upstream commit [2].  The original README of pam_tacplus held a configuration example with the debug parameter set, which might have resulted in some setups, which are running in debug-mode, based on the example configuration.  This issue got reported  by Adarsh Pandey from Arista Networks [3].
