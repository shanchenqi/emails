This acpi bypass is a bug, maybe, but it doesn't feel like a "real" security bug, because I'm not sure why this would be a feature somebody would want to lean on at this point in time. I wrote a PoC for this one rather than others because it seemed fun and technically interesting to poke around with acpi in this way, not because it's particularly rare or something.
