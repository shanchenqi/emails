With certain characters it is possible to modify the LDAP filter used to query the users on the connected LDAP server.  By measuring the response time, arbitrary attribute data can be retrieved from LDAP user objects.  Mitigation:      Upgrade to Apache Archiva or higher  References:  The newest Archiva version can be downloaded from: http://archiva.apache.org/download.cgi      Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
