I am not sure if this is specific to Ubuntu.  This setting changes the umask from the default:  # Enable setting of the umask group bits to be the same as owner bits # (examples: -> -> for non-root users, if the uid is # the same as gid, and username is the same as the primary group name. # # If set to yes, userdel will remove the user's group if it contains no # more members, and useradd will create by default a group with the name # of the user. # USERGROUPS_ENAB yes  Bob --  Bob Friesenhahn bfriesen@...ple.dallas.tx.us, http://www.simplesystems.org/users/bfriesen/ GraphicsMagick Maintainer,    http://www.GraphicsMagick.org/ Public Key,     http://www.simplesystems.org/users/bfriesen/public-key.txt  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
