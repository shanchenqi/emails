Please read better, and try to  write better mails. if you had doubts, you could ask me, in the same tread.  And if you discover a vulnerability, you should disclose it. This is the  standard way.   In any case:  No password should be stored in a world readable file. This is enforced  e.g. in ssh.  This is a good security advice.  DO NOT PUT WordPress passwords (e.g. for database, or admin password) in  world readable file (on multi-user machines).  This is in part a user error.  But PHP (as default LAMP) has this problem. I told you possible  work-around. So no system administrator should allow untrusted  multi-user with default LAMP setting.  This is fault of system  administrator: he should know the security risk before setting up  services. It is his job, and this is very well documented.  Then I told you various methods to improve the security.  But it seems you still do not understand "/home/loser is with  permissions default umask Note: this is also a question on  installation. System administrator choose this setting.   Do you want PHP run by root? (required with umask Or tell me what  should be the right setting? The error is simple: do not enable PHP in  the simple LAMP way without considering the security implication.  (suPHP, proxy, etc. are better ways).  Yes, Debian is not secure by default (if you install various packages),  but it has a lot of documentation, to asses the risk, and how to setup  things. But at the end, it is the system administrator job to check  security implication before to install servers. This is true on most of  professional distribution.  But look the Debian default of Apache: it is  still strict. WordPress installations (and so configuration snippet) are  just for single-user machine (and they have extensive documentation  about security).   If a official Debian mirror has such problem, it is worrying. OTOH all  Debian files are static files (so no passwords), and Debian sign all  files: we do not trust mirrors.   If you had some doubt on my answer, you could have reach me, and ask me  what you do not understand, or to continue the discussion. Your way to  ridicule Debian just ridicule yourself.  And if you want to continue, check my mails: they are long: please write  more complete mails: it helps you to order your ideas, and find flaws.  ciao 	cate    On Georgi Guninski wrote: > >  > === > /home/loser is with permissions default umask >  > on multiuser machines this sucks much. >  > on a multiuser debian mirror we found a lot of data, > including the wordpress password of the admin. > === >  > Then in the thread someone with @debian.org email explains > to me it is a feature, not a bug. >  > In a addition, they suggest to tell them the mirror, lol. >  > Are debian detached from reality? >   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
