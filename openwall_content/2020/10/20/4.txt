ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The Xen code handling the updating of the hypervisor's own pagetables tries to use 2MiB and 1GiB superpages as much as possible to maximize TLB efficiency.  Some of the operations for checking and coalescing superpages take non-negligible amount of time; to avoid potential lock contention, this code also tries to avoid holding locks for the entire operation.  Unfortunately, several potential race conditions were not considered; precisely-timed guest actions could potentially lead to the code writing to a page which has been freed (and thus potentially already reused).  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest can cause a host denial-of-service.  Data corruption or privilege escalation cannot be ruled out.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Versions of Xen from at least 3.2 onward are affected.  Only x86 systems are vulnerable.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.  Guests can only exercise the vulnerability if they have passed through hardware devices.  Guests without passthrough configured cannot exploit the vulnerability.  Furthermore, HVM and PVH guests can only exercise the vulnerability if they are running in shadow mode, and only when running on VT-x capable hardware (as opposed to SVM).  This is believed to be Intel, Centaur and Shanghai CPUs.  MITIGATION ==========  Running all guests in HVM or PVH mode, in each case with HAP enabled, prevent those guests from exploiting the vulnerability.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Hongyan Xia of Amazon.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.  Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.            xen-unstable      Xen      Xen Xen      Xen      Xen  $                    $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.   (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
