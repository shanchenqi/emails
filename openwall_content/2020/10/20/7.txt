But distros should be warned that and later may break the build of ghostscript, due to ghostscript's use of a withdrawn macro that wasn't intended for external usage:   Ghostscript's fix for that is at:  	-Alan Coopersmith-               alan.coopersmith@...cle.com 	 Oracle Solaris Engineering - https://blogs.oracle.com/alanc  -------- Forwarded Message -------- Subject: [ft-announce] Announcing FreeType Date: Tue, 20 Oct (CEST) From: Werner LEMBERG <wl@....org> To: freetype-announce@...gnu.org, freetype-devel@...gnu.org, freetype@...gnu.org   FreeType has been released.  It is available from       http://savannah.nongnu.org/download/freetype/  or       http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/  The latter site also holds older versions of the FreeType library.  See below for the relevant snippet from the CHANGES file.  Enjoy!       Werner   PS: Downloads from  savannah.nongnu.org  will redirect to your nearest      mirror site.

Note that  FreeType 2 is  a font service  and doesn't provide  APIs to perform higher-level features, like text layout or graphics processing (e.g.,  colored  text  rendering,  `hollowing',  etc.).   However,  it greatly simplifies these tasks by providing a simple, easy to use, and uniform interface to access the content of font files.  FreeType  2  is  released  under  two open-source  licenses:  our  own BSD-like FreeType  License and the  GPL.  It can  thus be used  by any kind of projects, be they proprietary or not.   ----------------------------------------------------------------------   CHANGES BETWEEN and     I. IMPORTANT BUG FIXES     - A heap buffer overflow has been found  in the handling of embedded      PNG bitmaps, introduced in FreeType version 2.6.               If you  use option  FT_CONFIG_OPTION_USE_PNG  you  should  upgrade      immediately.  _______________________________________________ Freetype-announce mailing list Freetype-announce@...gnu.org https://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/freetype-announce  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
