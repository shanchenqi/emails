Public release.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  x86 PV guest kernels may use hypercalls with INVLPG-like behavior to invalidate TLB entries even after changes to non-leaf page tables.  Such changes to non-leaf page tables will, however, also render stale possible TLB entries created by Xen's internal use of linear page tables to process guest requests like update-va-mapping.  Invalidation of these TLB entries has been missing, allowing subsequent guest requests to change address mappings for one process to potentially modify memory meanwhile in use elsewhere.  IMPACT ======  Malicious x86 PV guest user mode may be able to escalate their privilege to that of the guest kernel.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All versions of Xen expose the vulnerability.  The vulnerability is exposed to x86 PV guests only.  x86 HVM/PVH guests as well as ARM ones are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  There is no known mitigation.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Jann Horn of Google Project Zero.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate set of attached patches resolves this issue.  Note that these patches are known to produce serious performence problems for at least some workloads.  Work is ongoing to improve the performance, and this XSA will be updated when new patches are available.            xen-unstable      Xen      Xen      Xen      Xen      Xen  $                                            $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
