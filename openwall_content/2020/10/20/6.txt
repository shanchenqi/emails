ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  AMD IOMMU page table entries are updated in a step by step manner, without regard to them being potentially in use by the IOMMU.  Therefore it was possible that the IOMMU would read and then use a half-updated entry.  Furthermore, updates to Device Table entries lacked suitable ordering enforcement for certain steps involved in these updates.  In both case the specific outcome heavily depends on how exactly the compiler translated the affected pieces of code.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest might be able to cause data corruption and data leaks.  Host or guest Denial of Service (DoS), and privilege escalation, cannot be ruled out.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen versions are potentially vulnerable.  Only x86 systems with AMD, Hygon, or compatible IOMMU hardware are vulnerable.  Arm systems as well as x86 systems with VT-d hardware or without any IOMMUs in use are not vulnerable.  Only x86 guests which have physical devices passed through to them can leverage the vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  Not passing through physical devices to untrusted guests will avoid the vulnerability.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Paul Durrant of Amazon and Jan Beulich of SUSE.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate set of attached patches resolves this issue.  Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.            xen-unstable      Xen      Xen      Xen      Xen -  $               $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  HOWEVER, deployment of the mitigation is NOT permitted (except where all the affected systems and VMs are administered and used only by organisations which are members of the Xen Project Security Issues Predisclosure List).  Specifically, deployment on public cloud systems is NOT permitted.  This is because removal of pass-through devices or their replacement by emulated devices is a guest visible configuration change, which may lead to re-discovery of the issue.  Deployment of this mitigation is permitted only AFTER the embargo ends.  AND: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
