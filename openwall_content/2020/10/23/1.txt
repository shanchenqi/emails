If memory limits are not imposed on the Firecracker process, this might impair other microVMs on the same host from allocating memory, potentially becoming an availability issue.  Serial output generated by the guest can't trigger the issue.  # Affected Systems  Firecracker versions and while all older releases might be impacted.  # Mitigation  Impact can be mitigated by applying memory limits to the Firecracker process or by applying a rate limit when writing to the Firecracker process standard input.  Customers may apply: Patched binaries mitigating this issue have been released as Firecracker and Firecracker If you are using Firecracker versions up to or Firecracker we recommend you apply the provided fix.
