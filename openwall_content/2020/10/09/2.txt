Calcite uses internally this method to connect with Druid and Splunk so information leakage may happen when using the respective Calcite adapters.  The method itself is in a utility class so people may use it to create vulnerable HTTPS connections for other applications.  >From Apache Calcite onwards, the hostname verification will be performed using the default JVM truststore.  Mitigation: Users should upgrade to if: they are using Druid or Splunk adapters via HTTPS; they are using HttpUtils directly for HTTPS connections.
