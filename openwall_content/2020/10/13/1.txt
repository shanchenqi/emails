Yes, I'm still seeing this pattern in the academic world.  In general, shared file systems and an expectation of a generous umask are still very common in the academic and scientific world, where people routinely work collaboratively on large data sets and share snippets of code and data frequently.  > Once upon a time, a shared Unix system account come with an implied web > account which you could use to publish files and create your own > website.

I personally still maintain my web pages this way, although I'm not a good example, of course, and it's on my list to change.  :)  But I have also still seen this pattern in scientific work.  There's built-in support in Apache still.  > Plus even if I was going to implement such a system today, I might > seriously consider using - say "/web/loser" instead.

Yes, indeed.  It's certainly not an argument against changing the defaults; a small amount of additional user work to actively choose to share something is a better default approach.  --  Russ Allbery (eagle@...ie.org)             <https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/>  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
