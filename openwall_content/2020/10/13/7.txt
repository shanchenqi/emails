It was introduced by:   "dccp: don't free  ccid2_hc_tx_sock struct in dccp_disconnect()"  Proposed fixes have been posted to:    To mitigate this on systems that have DCCP enabled but do not use it, block module autoloading via adding the following to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-dccp.conf:     alias off    alias off    alias off    alias off  Alternatively, to prevent the dccp module from being loaded entirely, add:    blacklist dccp   install dccp /bin/false  Thanks.  --  Steve Beattie <sbeattie@...ntu.com>  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
