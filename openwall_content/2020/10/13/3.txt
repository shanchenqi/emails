This results in a denial of service for installations that always validate (dnssec=validate) and for clients requesting validation when on-demand validation is enabled (dnssec=process). The severity is high for these cases.  As usual, there were also other smaller enhancements and bugfixes. Please refer to the changelog[2], changelog[3] and changelog[4] for details.  The tarball[5] (signature[6]), tarball[7] (signature[8]) and tarball[9] (signature[10]) are available at our download site[11] and packages for CentOS 6, 7 and 8, Debian Stretch and Buster, Ubuntu Xenial and Bionic are available from our repository[12].  4.0 and older releases are EOL, refer to the documentation[13] for details about our release cycles.  Please send us all feedback and issues you might have via the mailing list[14], or in case of a bug, via GitHub[15].
