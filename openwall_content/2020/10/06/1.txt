However to prove security  requires going through a Common Criteria certification. The biggest issue is  that the desktoptop uses dbus instantiation which does not have the auid of  the requesting process. Meaning audit cannot work.  The fix was kdus. That was rejected. But the issue remains. There cannot be a  secure desktop without auditing. And no one is really pushing for a desktop  certification, therefore no one is pushing to fix audit desktop problems.  -Steve    Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
