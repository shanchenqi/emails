You can get some isolation fairly easily using firejail.  It's not as secure as eg. Qubes, but it's available in most distros and can be as simple as sticking "firejail" in front of a command.  You can use it to isolate your browser/irc/mail client, or possibly more importantly your build environment, from your wider home directory.  As usual the arch wiki has good doco:    https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/firejail#Usage  cheers  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
