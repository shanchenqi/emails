How is that relevant for "mobile devices" that run Linux today?  That link looks like a once of issue that Debian had with the distribution of Chromium. Which was probably fixed years ago.  More generally, in a typical Android install, there is closed source software - drivers, firmware, Google APIs, Google Play. Before you even get to installing closed source apps from Google Play.  These are a concern from a security point of view because you have to trust the device manufacturer / Google with the security aspects of such code, and there is no possibility of somebody else auditing the code because the source code is not available.  Android devices typically require a forked version of the Linux kernel. I believe they are slowly moving to reduce the changes required by merging them mainline, but not sure how that is progressing right now. Otherwise, I imagine this might have security concerns too. --  Brian May <brian@...uxpenguins.xyz> https://linuxpenguins.xyz/brian/  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
