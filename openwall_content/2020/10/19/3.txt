I sure hope that doesn't become the _only_ way, or I'll have some dark thoughts about the person who proposed it ;-) In any case I'll probably be dead by the time any of this is implemented, so maybe he has no worries.  I transfer between XA_PRIMARY and XA_SECONDARY using the Emacs *scratch* buffer as a way station. The only way I'm even physically able to drag is using pointer keys, ie. keypad Insert followed by keypad arrow keys followed by keypad Delete. And no I don't fit any of the predefined "disabled" pigeonholes so various accessibility kits do nothing for me.  XWindow and desktops based on it have many flaws including security ones, but it is flexible enough to be usable by "different" folks like me. Which of the modern replacements can say that, or even has actionable plans to address that?  --  Ian  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
