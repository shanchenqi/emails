These are my preferred default settings for multiuser machines and is  the historical default.  The settings can be changed when appropriate.  Ubuntu Linux (a Debian derivative) has changed the default.  However,  we found that the Ubuntu default caused problems for us while building  our software, and so we changed them back.  Users often need to share data.  There is a lesson to be learned that sensitive data and directories  under a user's home directory may still need to have more strict  permissions set by the applications which create them since the top of  the user's home directory might allow sharing.
