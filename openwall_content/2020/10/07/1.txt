You can run Android code just fine on mainline kernels, if you have proper hardware support merged upstream.  This has been true for many years now.  > I believe they are slowly moving to reduce the changes required by > merging them mainline, but not sure how that is progressing right now.  See the lwn.net articles from the Plumbers conference for the past few years as to the status of that effort.  Last I looked, it was a handful of out-of-tree patches for a few things that upstream did not want to take, but Android still had to support for backwards-compatibility issues.  Nothing major at all, odds are your favorite Linux distro kernel has more changes in it :)  And all of those changes are public and can be easily audited if you so desire.  thanks,  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
