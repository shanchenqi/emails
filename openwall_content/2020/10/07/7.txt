Yes, I agree the default should be changed.  Just note that there is a reasonable amount of software install instructions that assume umask is and will install software with unusable permissions if it is not.  Perhaps the worst example I can think of is Docker image builds. COPY/ADD will install the files in the Docker image with their current permissions with no way to override. So all the files inside the image unreadable for everyone except by root. If you want to run stuff inside the Docker image as non-root (which is recommended) you either have to fix the permissions first or add a RUN command to fix the permissions - which can be slow and the layer generated can be large (due to the inefficient way layers are represented in Docker). --  Brian May <brian@...uxpenguins.xyz> https://linuxpenguins.xyz/brian/  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
