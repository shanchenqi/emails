Further, it's not at all uncommon for sysadmins to not understand or consider the system defaults when making deployment decisions and failing to secure sensitive files.  As a long-time Debian user myself, I agree that this default is showing its age, and can represent a risk for operators who overlook it.  > Then in the thread someone with @debian.org email explains > to me it is a feature, not a bug.  Nowhere in that response do they call it a feature, and it's disingenuous of you to imply that they did. It's a default, which is almost always going to be a balance between two (or more) competing needs. Also, I encourage you to take a guess at how many people there are "with @debian.org email" (hint, it's not a small number).  A more informative response would probably have been to point you to https://wiki.debian.org/Debate/umask which provides pointers to where and how this would need to be solved in the long run.  > In a addition, they suggest to tell them the mirror, lol.  Yes, do you fault them for wanting to remove a likely compromised server from the network of volunteer-run package mirrors?  > Are debian detached from reality?  Your brusque and insulting attitude (saying their choices suck, calling them detached from reality, laughing at their explanations) is likely to trigger glib responses and cause people to be less inclined to pay attention to what you have to say. --  Jeremy Stanley  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
