Does anybody even do this anymore?  Once upon a time, a shared Unix system account come with an implied web account which you could use to publish files and create your own website. But I cannot personally think of any examples where this still happens. websystems and shell accounts are generally stored on distinct and independent systems.  Plus even if I was going to implement such a system today, I might seriously consider using - say "/web/loser" instead. Although this might have implications if quotas are important. Or maybe something that bind mounts /home/loser/www to /web/loser, that way the web software doesn't need access to /home/loser.  Even shared systems - while still around and still very important (HPC comes to mind) - are a lot less common then they use to be. Most Linux installs are private non-shared systems. Which I suspect explains why there isn't a more pressure to fix the default umask issue. --  Brian May <brian@...uxpenguins.xyz> https://linuxpenguins.xyz/brian/  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
