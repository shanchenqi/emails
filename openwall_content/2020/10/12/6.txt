The checks in place to prevent such features can be circumvented by using a combination of UPLOAD/CREATE actions.  Mitigation: Any of the following are enough to prevent this vulnerability: * Disable UPLOAD command in ConfigSets API if not used by setting the system property: "configset.upload.enabled" to "false" [1] * Use Authentication/Authorization and make sure unknown requests aren't allowed [2] * Upgrade to Solr or greater. * If upgrading is not an option, consider applying the patch in ([3]) * No Solr API, including the Admin UI, is designed to be exposed to non-trusted parties.
