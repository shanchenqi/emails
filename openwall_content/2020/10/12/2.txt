Stay on top of issues to ensure progress is being made, remind others when there's no apparent progress, as well as when the public disclosure date for an issue is approaching and when it's finally reached (unless the reporter beats you to it by making their mandatory posting to oss-security first) - primary: Gentoo, backup: Amazon  11. Make sure the mandatory oss-security posting is made promptly and is sufficiently detailed, and remind the reporter if not - primary: Gentoo, backup: Amazon  12. If exploit(s) were shared on the list, make sure that either they're included in the oss-security posting along with the issue detail or the posting includes an announcement of planned later posting of the exploits (with the delay being within list policy), and in the latter case also make sure that the later posting is in fact made as planned, and remind the reporter if not - primary: Gentoo, backup: Amazon  13. Keep track of per-report and per-issue handling and disclosure timelines (at least times of notification of the private list and of actual public disclosure), at regular intervals produce and share statistics (most notably, the average embargo duration) as well as the raw data (except on issues that are still under embargo) by posting to oss-security - primary: Gentoo, backup: Amazon  and we saw some contributions from Gentoo on these, most notable being their work on the statistics (task 13 above):  https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros/stats  Unfortunately, the last update of these statistics ("Last modified: by kristianf") is also when the contributions ceased.  Some others have been taking care of tasks 9, 11, 12 (in particular, Anthony Liguori of Amazon has been helping, but on various occasions also many others from other distros), but not yet of task 13.  I understand that Gentoo is a community project run by volunteers, and I am not complaining.  Rather, I think we need to discuss with Gentoo in here and reassign to other distros whatever responsibilities Gentoo no longer has resources for.  We should ideally keep at least one task Gentoo's responsibility (and Gentoo should have specific people assigned to that task), at least to be consistent with our current requirements for new distros joining (linux-)distros.  To Gentoo: which of these tasks, or other "contributing back" tasks, are you (still) willing to handle, and who on your team would handle them?  To others on linux-distros: which of the above tasks do you volunteer to become primary for?  To Amazon: do you want to remain backup for task 13, or do you not have the resources to handle it?  If Gentoo already has some work-in-progress on task 13 for October and on, yet we reassign this task to another distro, then that data and instructions should probably be transferred to the other distro.
