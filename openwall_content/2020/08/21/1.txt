In chronyd's main() function the call to `write_pidfile()` is made with full root privileges, while the privilege drop logic is only performed later via `SYS_DropRoot()`. The pidfile is created using `fopen()`.  It seems a common default setup for chronyd currently is as follows:  - "chrony" user and group are used as unprivileged accounts to run   chronyd as. - The directory /run/chrony is created via systemd-tmpfiles (or during   runtime by chronyd itself, in `CNF_CreateDirs()`). Ownership is passed   to chrony:chrony, mode is - The DEFAULT_PID_FILE path is set to /run/chrony/chronyd.pid (since   chrony 3.4).  This constellation means that a compromised chrony user account can stage a symlink attack in /run/chrony/chronyd.pid like follows:  ``` root# systemctl stop chronyd.service root# sudo -u chrony /bin/bash  # simulate a compromised chrony user staging a symlink attack chrony# cd /run/chrony chrony# ln -s /etc/fstab chronyd.pid chrony# exit  # make sure to keep a backup of /etc/fstab if it is dear to you root# cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.back root# /usr/sbin/chronyd -n ^C # fstab content got replaced by the chronyd PID root# cat /etc/fstab ```  So this attack mostly poses denial-of-service attack vector. It could also be used to pre-create a file with mode that would then later be used by other programs to store sensitive data.  # Mitigations  On recent systemd versions the issue is not severe as long as chronyd is only started via the systemd service unit. This is the case because it contains the ProtectSystem=full directive and thus no write permission is granted for system file locations.  # Upstream Fixes  Upstream created a bugfix release [3] that fixes this issue. The development master branch in the upstream git repository was not affected any more due to changed file open logic (switched from using `fopen()` to using `open()` and appropriate flags). The bugfix [4] was performed on a release branch for version  # Timeline  - I found the issue and reported it privately to the   upstream main developer Miroslav Lichvar. During the following two   weeks We discussed the issue and the possible fixes and agreed on a   patch. SUSE tracked the issue internally via Bugzilla [2].  - Upstream communicated to me a CVE assignment for the issue   and prepared the publication of bugfix release  [1]: https://chrony.tuxfamily.org [2]: [3]: https://chrony.tuxfamily.org/news.html [4]:  Cheers  Matthias  --  Matthias Gerstner <matthias.gerstner@...e.de> Dipl.-Wirtsch.-Inf.
