Each of these take a location parameter, which was not validated, i.e you could read/write to any location the solr user can access.  On a windows system SMB paths such as may also be used, leading to: * The possibility of restoring another SolrCore from a server on the network (or mounted remote file system) may lead to: ** Exposing search index data that the attacker should otherwise not have access to ** Replacing the index data entirely by loading it from a remote file system that the attacker controls  * Launching SMB attacks which may result in: ** The exfiltration of sensitive data such as OS user hashes (NTLM/LM hashes), ** In case of misconfigured systems, SMB Relay Attacks which can lead to user impersonation on SMB Shares or, in a worse-case scenario, Remote Code Execution  The solution implemented to address these issues was to: * Restrict the location parameter to trusted paths * Prevent remote connection when using Windows UNC Paths  ~ David Smiley Apache Lucene/Solr Search Developer http://www.linkedin.com/in/davidwsmiley   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
