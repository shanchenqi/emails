Our general assumption is to *not* consider assert() failures CVE worthy if they can only be triggered by privileged users [1]. In this case specifically, given the assertion failure occurs while sending packets from the guest, we assumed it may be possible for an unprivileged guest user to cause a DoS scenario (e.g., by sending malicious/malformed network packets). In accordance with QEMU maintainers, we therefore decided to provide a fix for this bug. But again, I agree these kinds of issues tend to be questionable, so we typically proceed on a case-by-case basis.
