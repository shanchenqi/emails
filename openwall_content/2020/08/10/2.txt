Is it really worth the effort to treat these things as security issues? There are so many ways to crash a machine (be it virtual or hardware), there are definitely countless ways to crash things from within privileged code.. what's the security impact of a hardware issue when, say, a driver code in the OS does a stupid thing and the hardware locks up?
