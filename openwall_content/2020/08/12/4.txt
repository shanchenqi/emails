The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * Jenkins * Jenkins LTS * Email Extension Plugin * Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin * Yet Another Build Visualizer Plugin  Additionally, we announce unresolved security issues in the following plugins:  * Flaky Test Handler Plugin  Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://www.jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  / Jenkins and earlier, LTS and earlier does not escape the tooltip content of help icons. Tooltip values can be contributed by plugins, some of which use user-specified values.  This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.   / Jenkins and earlier, LTS and earlier does not escape the project naming strategy description that is displayed on item creation.  This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users with Overall/Manage permission.   / Jenkins and earlier, LTS and earlier does not escape the remote address of the host starting a build via 'Trigger builds remotely'.  This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users with Job/Configure permission or knowledge of the Authentication Token.   / Email Extension Plugin stores an SMTP password in its global configuration file `hudson.plugins.emailext.ExtendedEmailPublisher.xml` on the Jenkins master as part of its configuration.  While this password is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted and displayed in plain text as part of the configuration form by Email Extension Plugin and This can result in exposure of the password.   (1) / Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.  This allows attackers with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.   (2) / (permission check) & (CSRF) Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.  This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified JDBC URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, potentially capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.  Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.   / Yet Another Build Visualizer Plugin and earlier does not escape tooltip content.  This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users with Run/Update permission.   / Flaky Test Handler Plugin and earlier does not require POST requests for the "Deflake this build" feature, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.  This vulnerability allows attackers to rebuild a project at a previous git revision where the tests were failing.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
