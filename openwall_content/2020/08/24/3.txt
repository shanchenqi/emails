It occurs while processing USB packets from a guest, when  'USBDevice->setup_len' exceeds the in  do_token_{in,out} routines.  A guest user may use this flaw to crash the QEMU process resulting in DoS OR  potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the QEMU process on  the host.  * Attached herein is an upstream patch from Gerd Hoffmann(CC'd) to fix this    issue.  * is assigned to this issue by Red Hat Inc.  * This issue was independently reported by Ziming Zhang, Gonglei Arei and    Yanyu Zhang(CC'd).     Gonglei and Yanyu mentioned that the issue was found by Xiao Wei(CC'd).   Thank you. -- Prasad J Pandit / Red Hat Product Security Team B54C C6EB 8B5A DE8D View attachment of type "text/plain" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
