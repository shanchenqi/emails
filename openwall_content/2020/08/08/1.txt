However, there is a heading on the vulnerabilities_24.html page that says this CVE is fixed in  Many projects include a "fixed in versions ..." list to indicate when something is fixed; I think this is less ambiguous.  The "affects versions" don't always line up with the heading that claims to be fixed, eg claims to be fixed in but the Affects entry doesn't mention  The headings are out of order:  $ curl -sq https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html | grep "Fixed in Apache" Fixed in Apache httpd Fixed in Apache httpd  # is between and Fixed in Apache httpd Fixed in Apache httpd Fixed in Apache httpd [..]  The download site doesn't have a download: https://archive.apache.org/dist/httpd/  But the file shows a release:  I don't actually care that much about -- I just tried to figure out the status of by looking at other examples on the page and found the page difficult to understand.  And, something is a bit off with the CURRENT-IS-$version markers:  $ curl -sq https://archive.apache.org/dist/httpd/ | grep -c CURRENT 47  I expected one in each of the 2.0, 2.2, and 2.4 series, or perhaps just one for the newest 2.4 release.
