The reporter stated that has been assigned. From context, it seems to be a paid assessment of our software for an unnamed client which increases motivation to get "results", in particular CVEs for "zero days" - which are then promptly reported publicly with an embargoed CVE.  The reporter has not replied to our statement that this behaviour is core functionality. I could not find out which organization has reserved so I decided to send email to this list to inform the organization, enabling them to update their records.  Sorry for using this list for that purpose, I could not find a less wrong place to inform the (hopefully) interested parties.   Best, Richard  [1] https://prometheus.io/ [2] [3] https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
