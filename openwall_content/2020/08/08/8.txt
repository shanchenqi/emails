Yes, you're correct. There is a mod_uwsgi maintained elsewhere in the wild.

Thanks - I've included our security mailing list to pass this feedback along to the rest of the security group as a heads up. As you can imagine, with such a strong downstream community from our releases, we try to be careful so as to not place too much information in the descriptions to make it trivial to exploit vulnerabilities before those downstream packagers can incorporate fixes. At the same time, there's always room for improvement :-)  Have a great weekend!  > Thanks, > > Alexander   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
