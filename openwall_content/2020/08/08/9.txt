However, there is a heading on the > vulnerabilities_24.html page that says this CVE is fixed in Hi, Seth;  Â Â  You're correct. That was an error on our part. We try to double check this data (since sometimes we burn a release number as we test the candidate) and things can get out of sync. I have it in my personal TODO list to add some tooling around automating this particular part of the release management process.  I've fixed this in a recent patch and the the site should now show the correct data - many thanks for the correction  > > Many projects include a "fixed in versions ..." list to indicate when > something is fixed; I think this is less ambiguous. > > The "affects versions" don't always line up with the heading that claims > to be fixed, eg claims to be fixed in but the > Affects entry doesn't mention  Right - sometimes this will happen when we don't release a version. This particular example is because was not released (see below for a bit more info).   > > The headings are out of order: > > $ curl -sq https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html | grep "Fixed in Apache" > Fixed in Apache httpd > Fixed in Apache httpd  # is between and > Fixed in Apache httpd > Fixed in Apache httpd > Fixed in Apache httpd > [..]  No problem - I thought about this as I was putting together the announcement but didn't adjust it at the time. I've fixed this as well   > The download site doesn't have a download: > https://archive.apache.org/dist/httpd/ > > But the file shows a release: >  Correct - was not released. We made a number of changes leading up to it, but ultimately found an issue in the release candidate that we fixed between then and a release that we were comfortable with.  If you're interested, you can see a bit more history (and even what's coming in future release) by taking a look at this file: http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/branches/2.4.x/STATUS  We always note when we tag a release and then the final release date for every version. You can find similar files for the old 2.2, 2.0, and 1.3 branches too.  > > I don't actually care that much about -- I just tried to > figure out the status of by looking at other examples on > the page and found the page difficult to understand. > > And, something is a bit off with the CURRENT-IS-$version markers: > > $ curl -sq https://archive.apache.org/dist/httpd/ | grep -c CURRENT > 47 I can see how that appears odd. This URL is our archive distribution point, so anything we release to the formal distribution point will be added here automatically to preserve history. It's best to use the current distribution point: https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/httpd/  We always maintain the zero-length CURRNT-IS-foo file here and remove non-current releases.   > > I expected one in each of the 2.0, 2.2, and 2.4 series, or perhaps just > one for the newest 2.4 release. > > Thanks   Thanks for taking the time to provide feedback!
