I feel the issue here is that with SSRF there often seems to be some kind of difficulty to pinpoint whether something is actually a flaw or an intended feature and who's to blame.  Ultimately these issues come down to this: * There's an expectation that network requests originating from   localhost (or from a tightly controlled internal network IP) can be   considered trustworthy and are performed by someone/something with   some form of local authority. * However that's not necessarily true as you may have many applications   that do outgoing network requests that in a variety of ways can be   controlled by an attacker.  I feel this is somehow also similar to fights between network security thinking and endpoint security thinking that we can see elsewhere. (e.g. the whole TLS interception debate.)  --  Hanno Bรถck https://hboeck.de/  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
