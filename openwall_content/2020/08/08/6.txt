I would suggest reaching MITRE: https://cve.mitre.org/cve/update_cve_entries.html - "Request an update to an exiting CVE entry" - Type: "Rejection"  They'll either do the update or point you to the assigning CNA.  Most likely they'll mark the issue as "DISPUTED" within a few business days.  Cheers!
