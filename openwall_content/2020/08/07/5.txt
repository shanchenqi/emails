In general, I think you include too little detail in these postings and at the link above.  You do include the bare minimum (thanks!), but it is unclear from these announcements where in the code the issues are.  You could reference source files and function names and/or commits fixing the issues.  You could also describe the impact in more detail - e.g., what kind of "info disclosure" (what info is potentially disclosed and to where).  I am just using this as an example of how I think you could improve reporting on Apache httpd vulnerabilities in general.  Thanks,  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
