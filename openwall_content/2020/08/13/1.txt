There is no possibility to recover from this state, resulting in a denial of service on the microVM when it is configured with a single network interface, and causing an availability problem for the microVM network interface on which the issue is triggered.  This issue is difficult to reproduce with TCP traffic. The TCP congestion algorithm makes it harder to fill both the TAP interface and virtio receive queues.  # Impact  When this issue is triggered, the guest kernel network interface will no longer receive packets.  # Vulnerable Systems  Firecracker releases and are affected.  # Mitigation  Patched binaries mitigating this issue have been released as Firecracker and Firecracker If you are using Firecracker or we recommend you apply the provided fix. If you are using Firecracker or below, you do not need to take any action.  [1] [2]  Best Regards, Serban Iorga on behalf of the Firecracker maintainers team.
