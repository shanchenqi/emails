The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the kernel.  Note, this "vulnerability" was only accessible by root, so there's not all that many privileges that could really be escalated there.  Don't know why the original poster did not say that here, as they acknowledged it in the "bug report" they sent many of us.  >  > This has been already addressed in the upstream commit  It was already "addressed" before this problem was pointed out to anyone, so this was not fixed in relation to this being reported.  Also, the fix is now in the kernel releases for those that care.  And finally, it was pointed out that any kernel running with the CONFIG_SLAB_FREELIST_HARDENED=y option would not have any problems with this issue before it was fixed.  > TREND MICRO EMAIL NOTICE >  > The information contained in this email and any attachments is confidential and may be subject to copyright or other intellectual property protection.
