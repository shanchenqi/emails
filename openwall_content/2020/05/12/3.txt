It occurs while importing the Commercial IP Security Option  | (CIPSO) protocol's category bitmap into SELinux's extensible bitmap via  | 'ebitmap_netlbl_import' routine. While parsing the CIPSO restricted bitmap  | tag in 'cipso_v4_parsetag_rbm' routine, it sets the security attribute to  | indicate that category bitmap is present, even if it has not been allocated.  | This leads to the said NULL pointer dereference issue while importing the  | same category bitmap into SELinux. A remote network user could use this flaw  | to crash the system kernel resulting in DoS scenario. | | This issue was introduced by upstream commit: |   -> |      netlabel: fix the horribly broken catmap functions  Upstream patch:   ->  Thank you. -- Prasad J Pandit / Red Hat Product Security Team B54C C6EB 8B5A DE8D   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
