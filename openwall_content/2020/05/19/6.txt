The VFIO modules allow users to enable or disable access to the  devices' MMIO memory address spaces. If a user attempts to access (read/write)  the devices' MMIO address space when it is disabled, some h/w devices issue an  interrupt to the CPU to indicate a fatal error condition, crashing the system.  This flaw allows a guest user or process to crash the host system resulting in  a denial of service.
