This flaw allows an authenticated client to modify the configuration and possibly conduct further attacks.  In ceph-mon daemon, the "kludge" for older clients in handle_command() allows any authenticated client access to the three whitelisted commands. An attacker with "mon r" caps can exploit this, e.g. to change configuration parameters using injectargs. For ceph-mgr daemon, in handle_command(MCommand), messages are queued to adminsocket without access checks if fsid is present. This can be exploited by an attacker without manager caps to run any MCommand including "config set".  has been assigned for this flaw.
