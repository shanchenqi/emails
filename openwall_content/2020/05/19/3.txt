Severity is medium. We would like to thank Lior Shafir, Yehuda Afek and Anat Bremler-Barr for finding and subsequently reporting this issue!  Records in the answer section of a NXDOMAIN response lacking an SOA were not properly validated. Severity is medium. We would like to thank Matt Nordhoff for finding and subsequently reporting this issue!  An attacker with enough privileges to change the hostname might be able to disclose uninitialized memory. This issue also affects the Authoritative Server and dnsdist; since the attack requires very high privileges and the issue does not affect Linux, we will not be releasing new versions for those just for this issue. Severity is low.  As usual, there were also other smaller enhancements and bugfixes. Please refer to the changelog[4], changelog[5] and changelog[6] for details.  The tarball[7] (signature[8]), tarball[9] (signature[10]) and tarball[11] (signature[12]) are available at our download site[13] and packages for CentOS 6, 7 and 8, Debian Stretch and Buster, Ubuntu Xenial and Bionic are available from our repository[14]  Note that the 4.1 packages will be published later today.  4.0 and older releases are EOL, refer to the documentation[15] for details about our release cycles.  Please send us all feedback and issues you might have via the mailing list[16], or in case of a bug, via GitHub[17].
