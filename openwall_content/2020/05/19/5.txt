This amplification makes it possible for Unbound to be used in a denial of service attack. The researchers discovering this called this attack the NXNSattack.  This attack makes use of cache bypassing using random subdomains in the NSDNAME in NS records. When these delegation records are received during iteration, and the answer does not contain glue records, a resolver has to send out a query to the get the IP address for one of the names. When this query fails (for example because the random name does not exist) a resolver will try the next one. A large set of NS records with random names can result in a large number of outgoing queries going to the same target. More details about this attack are available in the research paper, available at http://www.nxnsattack.com/.  = Fuzzing of the Unbound code made us aware of issues in the parser of received answers. Malformed answers received from upstream servers can result in Unbound entering an infinite loop and thereby becoming unresponsive. When compiled with --enable-debug it is also possible to trigger an assertion, resulting in Unbound to crash.  == Solution Download patched version of Unbound, or apply the patch manually.  + Downloading patched version Unbound is released with the patch  + Applying the Patch manually For Unbound the patch is:  Apply the patch containing fixes for both issues, using: 'patch -p1 < then run 'make install' to install Unbound.  == Acknowledgments We would like to thank Lior Shafir, Yehuda Afek, and Anat Bremler-Barr from Tel Aviv University for their work on the NXNSattack.  We would like to thank the OSS-Fuzz project for the discoveries resulting in  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
