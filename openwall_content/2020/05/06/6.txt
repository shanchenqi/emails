The list of roles provided for an OAuth1 access token are ignored, so when an OAuth1 access token is used to request a keystone token, the keystone token will contain every role assignment the creator had for the project instead of the provided subset of roles. This results in the provided keystone token having more role assignments than the creator intended, possibly giving unintended escalated access.
