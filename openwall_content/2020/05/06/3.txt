The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * Amazon EC2 Plugin * Copy Artifact Plugin * Credentials Binding Plugin * CVS Plugin * SCM Filter Jervis Plugin 0.3   Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  / Credentials Binding Plugin and earlier does not mask (i.e., replace with asterisks) secrets in the build log when the build contains no build steps.   / Credentials Binding Plugin allows specifying passwords and other secrets as environment variables, and will hide them from console output in builds. As a side effect of the fix for `$` characters in secrets are escaped to `$$`. This will then be expanded to `$` again once the secret is passed to (post) build steps.  Credentials Binding Plugin and earlier does not mask the escaped form of the secret (containing `$$`). This occurs for example in the "Execute Maven top-level targets" build step included in Jenkins.   / Copy Artifact Plugin and earlier performs improper permission checks when determining whether a build can copy artifacts from another project build. This allows attackers, usually with Job/Configure permission, to configure jobs to copy artifacts from jobs they have no permission to access.   / CVS Plugin and earlier does not require POST requests in several HTTP endpoints, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities. This allows attackers to create and manipulate tags, and to connect to an attacker-specified URL.   / Amazon EC2 Plugin and earlier does not use SSH host key validation when connecting to agents. This lack of validation could be abused using a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept these connections to build agents.   / Amazon EC2 Plugin and earlier does not require POST requests in several HTTP endpoints, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities. This allows an attacker to provision instances with an attacker-specified template ID.   / Amazon EC2 Plugin connects to Windows agents via HTTPS.  Amazon EC2 Plugin and earlier unconditionally accepts self-signed HTTPS certificates and does not perform hostname validation when connecting to Windows agents. This lack of validation could be abused using a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept these connections to build agents.   / Amazon EC2 Plugin provides a list of applicable credentials IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.  This functionality does not correctly check permissions in Amazon EC2 Plugin and earlier, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.   / SCM Filter Jervis Plugin and earlier does not configure its YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types. This results in a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure jobs with the filter, or control the contents of a previously configured job's SCM repository.
