Oddjob is a kind of D-Bus meta service to simplify the implementation of specific D-Bus services. It allows to use simple command line utilities to supply a D-Bus interface while all the D-Bus implementation details are kept within the oddjob daemon and its configuration files.  A simple implementation of such a utility is shipped as part of oddjob and is called "mkhomedir". It allows to create a user's home directory if it doesn't exist yet. This logic can either be triggered via D-Bus or via a simple pam_oddjob_mkhomedir PAM module. The D-Bus interface is by default only accessible to the root user. If the PAM module is configured then the logic can also be triggered by regular users logging in, if they don't have an existing home directory yet.  This "mkhomedir" utility contains a race condition. The problem is found in the copying of /etc/skel to a newly created home directory. The home directory itself is created as a first step and ownership of it is passed to the respective user. In a second step the skel directory is recursively copied into the new home directory.  If the target user has the ability to run code during this operation then he can setup a symlink attack. The following symlink, for example:  ``` user $ ln -s /etc /home/user/bin ```  when created at the right time will cause the mkhomedir service to give ownership of the /etc directory to the unpriviliged user, should /etc/skel/bin exist. The reason is found in the call to `chown()` in `oddjob_selinux_mkdir()` called in  A potential attacker could try and login in parallel e.g. via SSH to win this race condition. The probability to actually exploit this is low, however, because once the home directory is created, there is no way to repeat the attack. Chances could be higher in specialized setups where new users without home directories can be repeatedly created without special authentication requirements.  There can also be other symlink attack vectors when more deeply nested /etc/skel directory structures are involved.  I reported this privately to upstream on The issue was handled by the Red Hat Security team. They assigned for this issue. The upstream fix [3] for the issue is based on a suggested patch that I included in my initial report to upstream. A new minor release has been created by upstream that includes this fix.
