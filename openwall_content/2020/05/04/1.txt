Virtiofsd is meant to share a host  file system directory with a guest via virtio-fs device. The said DoS may  occur on the host, if the guest was to open the maximum number of file  descriptors under the shared directory. A guest user/process may use this flaw  to cause DoS issue on the host.  Upstream patch(es): -------------------    ->    ->  This issue was reported by Yuval Avrahami of Palo Alto Networks.
