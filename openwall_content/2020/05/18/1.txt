Risk: 	Remote attacker can keep submission-login service down, causing denial of 	service attack. For lmtp the risk is neglible, as lmtp is usually behind a 	trusted MTA.  Steps to reproduce: 	Send ``NOOP EE"FY`` to submission port, or similarly malformed command.  Solution: 	Upgrade to fixed version.  ------------------  Open-Xchange Security Advisory  Product: Dovecot IMAP server Vendor: OX Software GmbH  Internal reference: Vulnerability type: Improper handling of input data (CWE-20) Vulnerable version: - Vulnerable component: submission, lmtp Report confidence: Confirmed Solution status: Fixed by Vendor Fixed version: Researcher credits: Philippe Antoine (Catena Cyber) Vendor notification: Solution date: Public disclosure: CVE reference: CVSS: 5.3 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)  Vulnerability Details:  	Sending command followed by sufficient number of newlines triggers a 	use-after-free bug that might crash submission-login, submission or 	lmtp service.  Risk:  	Remote attacker can keep submission-login service down, causing denial 	of service attack. For lmtp the risk is neglible, as lmtp is usually 	behind a trusted MTA.  Steps to reproduce:  	This can be currently reproduced with ASAN or Valgrind. Reliable way to 	crash has not yet been discovered.  Solution:  	Upgrade to fixed version.  ------------------  Open-Xchange Security Advisory  Product: Dovecot Vendor: OX Software GmbH  Internal reference: Vulnerability type: Improper input validation (CWE-20) Vulnerable version: - Vulnerable component: submission, lmtp Report confidence: Confirmed Solution status: Fixed by Vendor Fixed version: Researcher credits: mailbox.org Vendor notification: Solution date: Public disclosure: CVE reference: CVSS: 5.3 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)  Vulnerability Details: 	Sending mail with empty quoted localpart causes submission or lmtp component 	to crash.  Risk: 	Malicious actor can cause denial of service to mail delivery by repeatedly 	sending mails with bad sender or recipient address.  Steps to reproduce: 	Send mail with envelope sender or recipient as ``<""@example.org>``.  Workaround: 	For submission there is no workaround, but triggering the bug requires valid 	credentials. 	For lmtp, one can implement sufficient filtering on MTA level to prevent mails 	with such addresses from ending up in LMTP delivery.  Solution: 	Upgrade to fixed version.  ------------------  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
