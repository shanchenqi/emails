It occurs in 'megasas_lookup_frame' routine when 's->reply_queue_head'  is set to a malicious value. A guest user/process may use this flaw to crash  the QEMU process on the host resulting in DoS scenario.  Upstream patch: ---------------    ->  This issue was reported by Ren Ding & Hanqing Zhao of SSLab Georgia Tech and  also by Alexander Bulekov. requested via ->  https://cveform.mitre.org/  Thank you. -- Prasad J Pandit / Red Hat Product Security Team B54C C6EB 8B5A DE8D   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
