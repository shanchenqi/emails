The fixcrlf and replaceregexp tasks also copy files from the temporary directory back into the build tree allowing an attacker to inject modified source files into the build process.  Mitigation:  Ant users of versions 1.1 to and to should set the java.io.tmpdir system property to point to a directory only readable and writable by the current user prior to running Ant.  Users of versions and can use the Ant property ant.tmpfile instead. Users of Ant can rely on Ant protecting the temporary files if the underlying filesystem allows it, but we still recommend using a private temporary directory instead.
