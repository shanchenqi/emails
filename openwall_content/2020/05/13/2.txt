This compromises any connection  established to the process via JMX, allowing extraction of credentials  and any other transferred data.  Mitigation: All users should either - remove the port parameter from the reporter configuration, - upgrade to or - obtain the source for their release from the Flink website or git and  apply the patch corresponding to their version from the list below:  1.1: 1.2: 1.3: 1.4: 1.5: 1.6: 1.7: 1.8: 1.9:  Credit: The issue was discovered in Flink by Jonathan Gallimore, Tomitribe and  Colm O hEigeartaigh, Talend.
