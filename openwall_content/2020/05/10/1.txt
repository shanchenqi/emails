This could allow for XXE-based attacks in applications that accept arbitrary configuration files from users. [1]  Affected: log4net up to  Mitigation: as there are no further releases of log4net beyond and the Logging Services PMC has voted [2] to mark the project dormant, users should not allow arbitrary configuration files to be specified from untrusted sources. While this is arguably a vulnerability, misuse of any framework allowing untrusted input to configure things is always a bad idea.
