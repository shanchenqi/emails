Well, normally these limits are enforced at the OS level. Depending on your OS of choice there are different ways in which this is done. On BSD-derived systems it is most often in /etc/login.conf via login classes, e.g.:  daemon:\         :ignorenologin:\         :datasize=infinity:\         :maxproc=infinity:\                         :stacksize-cur=8M:\         :localcipher=blowfish,a:\         :tc=default:  whereby the user under which Postfix runs would be assigned to the daemon class (or, of course, a class which you define with suitable restrictions) and have the limits above (“tc=default” means “inherit what is not explicitly defined above from the “default” class, rest is self-evident, I hope).
