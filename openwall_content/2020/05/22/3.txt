I am not professional admin, but does postfix require limits?  Do many widely used daemons need limits?  AFAIK most RFCs try to avoid DoS attacks, not sure.  You are right about the DoS impact, but I conjecture that if you DoS vanilla qmail long enough it will crash from memory corruption, lol.  Re mobile phone RAM: Looks like I was wrong, Samsung currently sells phones with only 12GB RAM.
