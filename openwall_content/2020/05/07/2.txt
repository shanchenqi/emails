Any authenticated user could create an EC2 credential for themselves for a project that they have a specified role on, then perform an update to the credential user and project, allowing them to masquerade as another user. Any authenticated user within a limited scope (trust/oauth/application credential) can create an EC2 credential with an escalated permission, such as obtaining admin while the user is on a limited viewer role. Both of these vulnerabilities potentially allow a malicious user to act as admin on a project that another user has the admin role on, which can effectively grant the malicious user global admin privileges.
