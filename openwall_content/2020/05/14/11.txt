I believe it was initially pointed out the flaw on Session here: https://github.com/bbangert/beaker/issues/35  Some improvements were made by adding a secret/HMAC but the Cache layer still has the same flaw. I reported the flaw on cache level here: I created a POC but didn't publish it on the ticket.  There is no CVE assigned to this.  This package exists on Fedora and Debian at least.  Should I take any extra action?
