Description ========== mwifiex_cmd_append_vsie_tlv() in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/scan.c calls memcpy() without checking the destination size may trigger a buffer overflower, which a local user could use to cause denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code.  in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/wmm.c calls memcpy() without checking the destination size.Since the source is given from remote AP which contains illegal wmm elements , this may trigger a heap buffer overflow.
