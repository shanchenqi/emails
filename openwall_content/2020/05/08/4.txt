At least the process to get CVE is faster nowadays, but you should think if CVE consumers (persons patching systems, software users etc) find those CVEs useful. In many cases they won't if there is no released package and if people are not commonly using the latest version from Git.  > If they waited until after the release, they'd get one, so that is creating > the wrong incentive. How do projects handle this?  One method is to have a page where you list people and details. Something like: https://www.mongodb.com/security and some vendors send small payments (sometimes using bug bounty platforms) or cheap items.  - --  Henri Salo -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----  =3AYf -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
