This flaw could lead to potential XSS attacks due to the lack of proper neutralization of untrusted input. If the attacker knows the path to a publicly readable object on any RGW cluster and the object is at least large enough to cover the attack body then it's possible to run an XSS on any object.  This flaw was introduced with commit 9, and affects all the way up to master. Red Hat has assigned for this issue.  Upstream Patches:   Credit:  - Initial report to DigitalOcean by William Bowling twitter handle @wcbowling - Further evaluation and extension to Robin H. Johnson @robbat2, rjohnson@...italocean.com  PS: The patches are currently available from ceph.git clone(ceph-ci) and will be pushed to active releases soon.
