Messages encrypted using a reused nonce value are susceptible to serious confidentiality and integrity attacks.  This flaw was introduced in commit ("msg/async, v2: drop depedency on Clean up onwire crypto.") and affects all the ceph versions from Red Hat has assigned for this issue.  Upstream Patches:    Credit: Ilya Dryomov (Red Hat)   PS: The patches are currently available from ceph.git clone(ceph-ci) and will be pushed to active releases soon.
