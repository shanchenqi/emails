The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * AWSEB Deployment Plugin * Code Coverage API Plugin * FitNesse Plugin * Gatling Plugin * useMango Runner Plugin 1.5   Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  / Code Coverage API Plugin and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks. This allows a user able to control the input files for the "Publish Coverage Report" post-build step to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins master or server-side request forgery.   / Gatling Plugin and earlier serves Gatling reports in a manner that bypasses the `Content-Security-Policy` protection introduced in Jenkins and This results in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to change report content.   / AWSEB Deployment Plugin and earlier does not escape various values printed as part of form validation output.  This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.   / FitNesse Plugin and earlier does not correctly escape report contents before showing them on the Jenkins UI.  This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to control the XML input files processed by the plugin.   / Multiple form validation endpoints in useMango Runner Plugin 1.4 and earlier do not escape values received from the useMango service.  This results in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to control the values returned from the useMango service.
