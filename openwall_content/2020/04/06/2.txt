Because of this, an attacker with the ability run code in kernel space of a guest VM can cause the host kernel to panic.  There were two commits that, according to the reporter, introduced the vulnerability:    ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Pull out TM state save/restore   		into separate procedures")   ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Work around XER[SO] bug in fake   		suspend mode")  The former landed in 4.8, the latter in This was fixed without realizing the impact in with the following three commits, though it's believed the first is the only strictly necessary commit:    ("KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: Add guest MSR parameter for   		kvmppc_save_tm()/kvmppc_restore_tm()")   ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Factor fake-suspend handling out   		of kvmppc_save/restore_tm")   ("KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: Move kvmppc_save_tm/kvmppc_restore_tm   		to separate file")  Thus, the only upstream kernel affected is the kernel -- Ubuntu's kernels are affected because we backported to our kernels. It does not appear to have been cherrypicked to any of the upstream stable kernels.  Discovered by Gustavo Romero and Paul Mackerras.
