It could occur while copying network data to/from its tx/rx frame  buffers, as it does not check frame size against the data length.  A remote user/process could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process resulting  in Dos OR potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the QEMU  process on the host.  Upstream patch:    ->  This issue was reported by Ziming Zhang and Li Qiang (Ant Financial).  requested via -> https://cveform.mitre.org/  Thank you. -- Prasad J Pandit / Red Hat Product Security Team B54C C6EB 8B5A DE8D   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
