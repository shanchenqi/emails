A difficult to exploit stack-based buffer overflow in the _DtCreateDtDirs() function in the Common Desktop Environment version distributed with Oracle Solaris 10 (Update 11) and earlier may allow local users to corrupt memory and potentially execute arbitrary code in order to escalate privileges via a long X11 display name. The vulnerable function is located in the libDtSvc library and can be reached by executing the setuid program dtsession.  A buffer overflow in the _SanityCheck() function in the Common Desktop Environment version distributed with Oracle Solaris 10 (Update 11) and earlier allows local users to gain root privileges via a long calendar name or calendar owner passed to sdtcm_convert in a malicious calendar file.

It looks like Bugtraq is not accepting posts anymore: it finally happened, the end of an era...  --  Marco Ivaldi, Offensive Security Manager CISSP, OSCP, QSA, ASV, OPSA, OPST, OWSE, PRINCE2F @Mediaservice.net S.r.l. con Socio Unico https://www.mediaservice.net/   View attachment of type "text/plain" bytes)  View attachment of type "text/plain" bytes)  View attachment of type "text/plain" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
