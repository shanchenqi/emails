On POWER9 CPUs, this means that a CPU may return from idle with the AMR  value of another thread on the same core.  This allows a trivial Denial of Service attack against KVM hosts, by  booting a guest kernel which makes use of the AMR, such as a v5.2 or  later kernel with Kernel Userspace Access Prevention (KUAP) enabled.  The guest kernel will set the AMR to prevent userspace access, then the  thread will go idle. At a later point, the hardware thread that the  guest was using may come out of idle and start executing in the host,  without restoring the host AMR value. The host kernel can get caught in  a page fault loop, as the AMR is unexpectedly causing memory accesses to  fail in the host, and the host is eventually rendered unusable.  The fix is to correctly save and restore the AMR in the idle state  handling code.  The bug does not affect POWER8 or earlier Power CPUs.  has been assigned.
