When the system is configured to panic on events being dropped, an attacker who is able to trigger an audit event that starts while auditd is in the process of starting may be able to cause the system to panic by exploiting a race condition in audit event handling. This creates a denial of service by causing a panic." >  >  That bug link seems to be restricted at the moment :(  > Env: >     Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.7 (Maipo) >      Any hint on if this is still an issue on the "mainline" kernel.org releases or not given that is a bit old?  thanks,  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
