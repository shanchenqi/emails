This could allow an SMTPS connection to be intercepted by a man-in-the-middle attack which could leak any log messages sent through that appender.  Mitigation: Users should upgrade to Apache Log4j which fixed this issue in by making SSL settings configurable for SMTPS mail sessions. As a workaround for previous releases, users can set the `mail.smtp.ssl.checkserveridentity` system property to `true` to enable SMTPS hostname verification for all SMTPS mail sessions.
