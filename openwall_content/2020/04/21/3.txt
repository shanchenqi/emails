When downloading a package, Pacman checks two files: the database file and the package itself. According to their wiki[1], the package files are PGP-signed by the developers. The database, however, is not signed. This means that Pacman, running as root, is both downloading and parsing untrusted input from the Internet. Should there be any relevant bug in Pacman, this would lead to root code execution on every Arch/Arch-based machine using the package repositories.  Some scenarios in which this could happen:  * One or more of the mirrors (not run by Arch devs) is compromised and    the malicious database file is picked up by a small set of users or    project committers  * The main fan-out server (rsync.archlinux.org) is compromised and the    malicious database file is propagated to all mirrors worldwide  * A new mirror, run by a malicious actor, is submitted for approval to    be included in the official mirror list  * A man-in-the-middle attack is launched on any number of plain HTTP    mirrors, replacing the database file with a malicious one in transit  The code supports database signatures, so the real issue is the distro infrastructure.
