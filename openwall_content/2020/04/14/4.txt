ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Grant table operations are expected to return 0 for success, and a negative number for errors.  The fix for / introduced a path through grant copy handling where success may be returned to the caller without any action taken.  In particular the status fields of individual operations are left uninitialised, and may result in errant behaviour in the caller of GNTTABOP_copy.  IMPACT ======  A buggy or malicious guest can construct its grant table in such a way that, when a backend domain tries to copy a grant, it hits the incorrect exit path.  This returns success to the caller without doing anything, which may cause in crashes or other incorrect behaviour.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Systems running any version of Xen are vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  Only guests with access to transitive grants can exploit the vulnerability.  In particular, this means that:   * ARM systems which have taken the fix are not vulnerable, as    Grant Table v2 was disabled for other security reasons.   * All systems with the fixes, and booted with    `gnttab=max-ver:1` or `gnttab=no-transitive` are not vulnerable.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Pawel Wieczorkiewicz of Amazon and Jürgen Groß of SUSE.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.  Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.        Xen 4.9 - xen-unstable  $  $  NOTE CONCERNING SHORT EMBARGO =============================  This issue was discovered in response to the predisclosure.  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  However, deployment of the mitigations is NOT permitted (except where all the affected systems and VMs are administered and used only by organisations which are members of the Xen Project Security Issues Predisclosure List).  Specifically, deployment on public cloud systems is NOT permitted.  This is because it is a guest visible change which will draw attention to the issue. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----  =hix9 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
