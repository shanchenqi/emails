ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Unprivileged guests can request to map xenoprof buffers, even if profiling has not been enabled for those guests.  These buffers were not scrubbed.  This is  Furthermore, for guests for which "active" profiling was enabled by the administrator, the xenoprof code uses the standard Xen shared ring structure.  Unfortunately, this code did not treat the guest as a potential adversary: it trusts the guest not to modify buffer size information or modify head / tail pointers in unexpected ways.  This is  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest may be able to access sensitive information pertaining to other guests.  Guests with "active profiling" enabled can crash the host (DoS).  Privilege escalation cannot be ruled out.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Only x86 PV guests can leverage the vulnerabilities.  Arm guests and x86 HVM and PVH guests cannot leverage the vulnerabilities.  All Xen versions back to at least 3.2 are vulnerable.  Any x86 PV guest can leverage the information leak.  Only x86 PV guests whose host administrator has explicitly enabled "active profiling" for an untrusted guest can exploit the DoS / potential privilege escalation.  Only builds of Xen with the Xenoprof functionality enabled at build time are vulnerable.  The option to disable the functionality at build time was been introduced in Xen 4.7.  MITIGATION ==========  Never making any untrusted guests "active" will avoid all but the info leak part of the vulnerabilities.  There's no known mitigation for the information leak (lack of scrubbing).  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Ilja Van Sprundel of IOActive.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached set of patches resolves these issues.  The first patch fixes the information leak issue, and should be applied to all x86 systems running untrusted PV guests.  The second patch fixes the "active profiling" issue.  Systems which do not enable active profiling can safely skip patch 2.  Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.          xen-unstable, Xen 4.9.x -  $    $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
