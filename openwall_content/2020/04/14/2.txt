ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The read-write unlock paths don't contain a memory barrier.  On Arm, this means a processor is allowed to re-order the memory access with the preceding ones.  In other words, the unlock may be seen by another processor before all the memory accesses within the "critical" section.  As a consequence, it may be possible to have a writer executing a critical section at the same time as readers or another writer. In other words, many of the assumptions (e.g a variable cannot be modified after a check) in the critical sections are not safe anymore.  The read-write locks are used in hypercalls (such as grant-table ones), so a malicious guest could exploit the race.  For instance, there is a small window where Xen can leak memory if XENMAPSPACE_grant_table is used concurrently.  IMPACT ======  A malicous guest may be able to leak memory, or cause a hypervisor crash resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Information leak and privilege escalation cannot be excluded.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Systems running all versions of Xen are affected.  Whether an individual Arm-based CPU is vulnerable depends on its memory re-ordering properties.  Consult your CPU vendor.  x86 systems are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  There is no known mitigation.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Julien Grall of Amazon.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.  Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.            xen-unstable      Xen - Xen 4.9  $    $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
