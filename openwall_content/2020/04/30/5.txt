While discussing the issue it became apparent that SELinux was not properly handling the case where multiple netlink messages were placed in the sk_buff that is passed to the netlink_send LSM hook (the SELinux implementation is in selinux_netlink_send()).  A patch has been posted to the SELinux mailing list (archive link below) and will be sent to Linus shortly for inclusion in an upcoming Linux v5.7-rcX release.  * SELinux mailing list discussion -  * Patch which addresses the problem -  --  paul moore www.paul-moore.com  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
