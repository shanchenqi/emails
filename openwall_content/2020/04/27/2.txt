It was initially discovered by Sergei Trofimovich (slyfox) and reported by me  privately to upstream. The upstream reference is at: There is no CVE assigned.  Here is the additional upstream comment:  I fixed enough recursive functions to make the ASAN-instrumented re2c pass on this file (but that doesn't fully fix as some other recursive functions still need rewriting, work in progress). This is the list of fixes: Rewrite recursion into iteration  (Tarjan's SCC algorithm and YYFILL states). Rewrite recursion into iteration  (paths for -Wundefined-control-flow). Rewrite recursion into iteration  (skeleton max path length computation). Rewrite recursion into iteration  (insertion of negative tags in RE). They will appear in the next release,   Agostino    Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
