The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * AWS SAM Plugin * Copr Plugin * Parasoft Findings Plugin * Yaml Axis Plugin   Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  / Copr Plugin 0.3 and earlier stores credentials unencrypted in job `config.xml` files as part of its configuration. These credentials can be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the master file system.   / Parasoft Findings Plugin and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks. This allows a user able to control the input files for the Parasoft Findings parser to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins master or server-side request forgery.   / Yaml Axis Plugin and earlier does not configure its YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types. This results in a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure a multi-configuration (Matrix) job, or control the contents of a previously configured job's SCM repository.   / AWS SAM Plugin and earlier does not configure its YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types. This results in a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure a job or control the contents of a previously configured "AWS SAM deploy application" build step's YAML SAM template file (`template.yaml` or equivalent) file.
