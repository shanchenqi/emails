Affected versions:  Squid 2.x ->                     Squid 3.x ->                     Squid 4.x ->                     Squid 5.x -> Fixed in version:   Squid and __________________________________________________________________          __________________________________________________________________  Problem Description:   Due to an integer overflow bug Squid is vulnerable to credential  replay and remote code execution attacks against HTTP Digest  Authentication tokens.  __________________________________________________________________  Severity:   When memory pooling is used this problem allows a remote client  to replay a sniffed Digest Authentication nonce to gain access  to resources that are otherwise forbidden.   When memory pooling is disabled this problem allows a remote  client to perform remote code execution through the free'd nonce  credentials.  __________________________________________________________________  Updated Packages:   This bug is fixed by Squid versions and   In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable  releases can be found in our patch archives:  Squid 4:    If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer  to the package vendor for availability information on updated  packages.  __________________________________________________________________  Determining if your version is vulnerable:   All Squid-2.x up to and including are not vulnerable.   All Squid-2.5 up to and including are vulnerable.   All Squid-2.x up to and including configured with  "auth_param digest" are vulnerable.   All Squid-2.x up to and including configured without  "auth_param digest" are not vulnerable.   All Squid-3.x up to and including built with  --disable-auth are not vulnerable.   All Squid-3.2 up to and including built with  --disable-auth-digest are not vulnerable.   All Squid-3.x up to and including configured with  "auth_param digest" are vulnerable.   All Squid-3.x up to and including configured without  "auth_param digest" are not vulnerable.   All Squid-4.x up to and including built with  --disable-auth are not vulnerable.   All Squid-4.x up to and including built with  --disable-auth-digest are not vulnerable.   All Squid-4.x up to and including configured with  "auth_param digest" are vulnerable.   All Squid-4.x up to and including configured without  "auth_param digest" are not vulnerable.   built with --disable-auth-digest is not vulnerable.   configured with "auth_param digest" are vulnerable.   configured without "auth_param digest" are not  vulnerable.  __________________________________________________________________  Workaround:  Either,   Remove all "auth_param digest" lines from squid.conf  Or,   Build Squid with --disable-auth-digest  Or,   Build Squid with --disable-auth  __________________________________________________________________  Contact details for the Squid project:   For installation / upgrade support on binary packaged versions  of Squid: Your first point of contact should be your binary  package vendor.   If your install and build Squid from the original Squid sources  then the squid-users@...ts.squid-cache.org mailing list is your  primary support point. For subscription details see  <http://www.squid-cache.org/Support/mailing-lists.html>.   For reporting of non-security bugs in the latest STABLE release  the squid bugzilla database should be used  <http://bugs.squid-cache.org/>.   For reporting of security sensitive bugs send an email to the  squid-bugs@...ts.squid-cache.org mailing list. It's a closed  list (though anyone can post) and security related bug reports  are treated in confidence until the impact has been established.  __________________________________________________________________  Credits:   This vulnerability was discovered by ClĂŠment Berthaux and  Florian Guilbert of Synacktiv.
