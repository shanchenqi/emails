(Note this concerns Excuberant Ctags and not Universalt Ctags which is a continuation for the former.)  For example the issue in ctags was fixed in by the original author in the upstream subversion repository, but a proper release was never made after the affected 5.8 version was released. Some distributions (most notably Debian, Centos 8) have switched to distributing a version based on an svn checkout, whereas others (OpenBSD, FreeBSD, pkgsrc, CentOS < 8, Homebrew, etc) were still using the actual 5.8 release.  For ctags it can be triggered by specifying an existent but unreadable regex file with the following proof-of-concept:  $ touch "%p %p"; chmod "%p %p"; ectags --regex-c="@%p %p" ectags: Warning: 0x0 : Permission denied ectags: No files specified. Try "ectags --help". $  Or a simple crasher:  $ touch %n; chmod %n; ectags --regex-c=@%n ectags: Warning: zsh: segmentation fault (core dumped)  ectags --regex-c=@%n $  and for x2vpn it relies on overwriting argv[0]:  ctags % %08x" x2vnc localhost:0 ConnectToTcpAddr: connect: Connection refused %08x %08x: unable to connect to VNC server ctags %  I described some more details in https://blog.jasper.la/poking-old-format-string-bugs.html  I'm posting to this list to make sure other vendors are aware of these issues in ctags and x2vnc because eventhough there were fixed in many vendors are still shipping the vulnerable code. If CVEs were to be allocated from the and ranges for ctags and x2vnc respectively to make tracking these issues easier, that wouldn't hurt I guess.
