[...]  Indeed, if the local attacker is already capable of opening a socket to the MTA, then it seems like it would be even easier instead to just open an outbound socket to the target's MTA directly from that server and bypass the restrictions applied by the local relaying MTA entirely (unless the local MTA process has privileged access to something like a DKIM key or durable TLS client key which the attacker can't access due to filesystem ACLs). Then they wouldn't need to lean on lack of homoglyph differentiation at the recipient's end at all. --  Jeremy Stanley  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
