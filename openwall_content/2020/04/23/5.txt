The original message Subject was:  Subject: Fwd: Re: postfix (other versions may be affected)  To make having this in here reasonable, I think we should first consider discussing the general (non-)issue and only then specific software.

How exactly would a mail server block a message from an existing username (even without the homoglyph attack for now), and under what scenario - message being submitted locally or via SMTP?  For locally submitted messages, depending on mail server architecture, it may be technically possible to infer the real sender (e.g., which user invoked an SGID program to submit the message to the queue, or which user connected to a Unix domain socket).  However, if so the mail server would reasonably not merely block sending mail from other existing local usernames (and allow mail from non-existent local-looking usernames) but would rather insist on the message having the one correct username specified as its sender (retrieving the username by UID and either substituting it or comparing exact strings, so a homoglyph attack is irrelevant).  For messages received via SMTP, the exact sender can generally not be determined, but a message appearing to come from a locally hosted domain name may be accepted or rejected or inbetween depending on anti-spam settings and such (which may also provide limited anti-spoofing).  I'd expect such configuration to be per-domain (applying regardless of whether the claimed sender's name exists locally or not), not per-user. While use cases can exist where it'd make sense to reject only messages from usernames that exist locally, that feels like a special case, and I doubt is a default configuration - or is it a default somewhere?  Even if it is, is it an expected security feature (rather than a best-effort anti-spam filter, perhaps one of many)?  That's highly doubtful.  Finally, are we talking about envelope-from, header From, header Sender, or/and something else?  With these questions, I am trying to show that PromiseLabs' report leaves so much unspecified that claiming a specific attack is premature. Let alone request (and even successfully obtain) a CVE ID.  > > Use  So now we have a CVE ID specifically against Postfix while the issue is probably generic (or possibly a non-issue, depending on how you look at it) and if there's anything specific to Postfix here then it's possibly Postfix actually trying to prevent spoofing (or just spam) in some cases, but not doing so perfectly.  Should either of these cases really result in a CVE ID against Postfix?  Also, is the issue (if one exists) potentially fixable?  Probably not directly - that is, there's probably no reliable way to prevent just the homoglyph attacks.  Instead, either whatever check possibly exists can be removed or relaxed (also accept messages appearing from usernames that do exist locally) for the sake of consistency, or the check can be changed to be per-domain.  Either way, it'd not care about the usernames anymore (assuming it currently somehow does).  I suggest that PromiseLabs research and describe the issue for real, which in my opinion they did not yet.
