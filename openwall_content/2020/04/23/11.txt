This is not really job of postfix to block.  It is trivial to block internationalized local mail in a milter (note: I maintain pymilter) - or just refuse to create non-ascii mailboxes.    You don't even need utf- 8 for this attack - the infamous Arial font makes homoglyphs like lBM (which looks exactly like IBM in Arial) possible, and email localpart is case sensitive.  So I also recommend forcing all local mailboxes to be all lower case.  (Some businesses force to all upper case instead.)    If anything, this is a security bug in the *font* (which the term homoglyph implies), and the CVE should specify the problematic font or fonts.
