This was discovered while  doing a black box test on one of our clients, and it should be noted  that the VRFY command has been enabled on the server, hence there was no  reason to look for another way. However I'm unaware whether disabling  VRFY would alter this behaviour. As you can see, the reported issue  itself is may be actually due to the possibility of relaying a local  email from a non-existing user.  Having said this, if not then I assume then you are correct, in case we  take the "to" header into consideration in relation to user probing,  unless I'm missing your logic.  --- PLPR: Plamen Dimitrov Penetration Tester, CEH & OSCP certified  Promise Solutions LTD Penetration Testing and Managed Security services  https://www.promisedev.com https://www.promiselabs.net 22 05 12  On Solar Designer wrote: > On Thu, Apr 23, at PromiseLabs Pentest Research  > wrote: >> To follow up on your questions: >  > Thanks!
