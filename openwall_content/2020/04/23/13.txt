I actually meant probing via the "Sender address rejected: not logged in" messages, which while delivered in response to a RCPT TO depend on the MAIL FROM address.  However, as Wietse tells us this merely probes the smtpd_sender_login_maps table, so is very limited and configuration-specific.  Besides, as Wietse and you correctly remind us, the possibility to probe for valid addresses via RCPT TO is in practice unavoidable on modern Internet.  So the point of blocking probing of which sender addresses can vs. can not (do not need to) authenticate is moot given that in typical setups those addresses are also potential recipient addresses and thus could also be probed via RCPT TO.  What you reported originally, where you bypass something that just happens that way in some configurations and wasn't meant to provide any security against sender address spoofing, looks like even less of an issue to me.  Does anyone see any reasonable action on these (non-)issues?  If not, I think the CVE should be rejected.  It's a case of "works as intended."  > >>>>> Use  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
