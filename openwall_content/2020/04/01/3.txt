The issue was discovered via the fuzz test    Affected components:  Kubernetes API server    Affected versions:     -     <=    -        -      How do I mitigate this vulnerability?  Prior to upgrading, these vulnerabilities can be mitigated by preventing unauthenticated or unauthorized access to kube-apiserver.
