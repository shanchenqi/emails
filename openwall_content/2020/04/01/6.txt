They are still subject to role-based authorization checks, if configured. - Callers of Druid APIs can retrieve any LDAP attribute values of users that exist on the LDAP server, so long as that information is visible to the Druid server. This information disclosure does not require the caller itself to be a valid LDAP user.  Mitigation: - Users of Druid that use LDAP authentication should upgrade to Druid  Credit: This issue was discovered by Grzegorz GoĹawski.
