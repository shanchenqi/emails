If the "createMBServerConnectorFactory" property of the default InstrumentationManagerImpl is not disabled, then it is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MITM) style attack.  An attacker on the same host can connect to the registry and rebind the entry to another server, thus acting as a proxy to the original. They are then able to gain access to all of the information that is sent and received over JMX.  Mitigation:  Users of Apache CXF that use the InstrumentationManagerImpl should update to either or Alternatively, set the createMBServerConnectorFactory property to false and use the default JVM JMX remote capabilities instead. From CXF the createMBServerConnectorFactory property will be removed altogether.  Credit:  Jonathan Gallimore, Tomitribe and Colm O hEigeartaigh, Talend.
