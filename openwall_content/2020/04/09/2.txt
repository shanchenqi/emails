Not real-world as the number of installations is maybe 6 now, but the one I wrote removes leading duplicates from index records (replacing with a dup count).  I believe that timing the lookups could disclose bytes as described.  It's super efficient, though.  :-)   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
