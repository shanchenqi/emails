The longer version would be something like:    This is an example of a situation where no one filed for a CVE because   of perceived hurdles in the process, even if the facts didn't justify   the perception.  Now of course Moritz tells us there is in fact a CVE and indeed I can locate the issue in Debian's security tracker. I guess it has been judged not serious enough to need fixing in buster. I disagree but clearly that is up to the maintainers.  --  Ian  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
