This function is not used internally in musl and is not widely used, but does appear in some applications. The non-input-limiting form wcsrtombs is not affected.  All users of musl and prior versions should apply the attached patch, which replaces the overly complex and erroneous implementation. The upcoming release will adopt this new implementation.
