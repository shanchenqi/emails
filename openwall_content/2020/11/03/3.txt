The patches supplied in version 4 were found to have a significant performance impact.  An alternative approach was developed and has now been committed to the relevant Xen branches.  The alternative approach is simpler and mitigates the performance problems.  At the time of writing the patches in v4 are believed to be correct and sound, but if we discover that this is not the case we will not issue a further update.  We recommend the use of the patches provided in the Xen git branches, which are the same as those attached in this version of the advisory.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  x86 PV guest kernels may use hypercalls with INVLPG-like behavior to invalidate TLB entries even after changes to non-leaf page tables.  Such changes to non-leaf page tables will, however, also render stale possible TLB entries created by Xen's internal use of linear page tables to process guest requests like update-va-mapping.  Invalidation of these TLB entries has been missing, allowing subsequent guest requests to change address mappings for one process to potentially modify memory meanwhile in use elsewhere.  IMPACT ======  Malicious x86 PV guest user mode may be able to escalate their privilege to that of the guest kernel.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All versions of Xen expose the vulnerability.  The vulnerability is exposed to x86 PV guests only.  x86 HVM/PVH guests as well as ARM ones are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  There is no known mitigation.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Jann Horn of Google Project Zero.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate set of attached patches resolves this issue.   xen-unstable      Xen      Xen      Xen      Xen      Xen  $              $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
