ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Researchers have demonstrated using software power/energy monitoring interfaces to create covert channels, and infer the operations/data used by other contexts within the system.  Access to these interfaces should be restricted to privileged software, but it was found that Xen doesn't restrict access suitably, and the interfaces are accessible to all guests.  For more information, see:   https://platypusattack.com    IMPACT ======  An unprivileged guest administrator can sample platform power/energy data.  This may be used to infer the operations/data used by other contexts within the system.  The research demonstrates using this sidechannel to leak the AES keys used elsewhere in the system.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Power/energy monitoring interfaces are platform and architecture specific.  Consult your hardware vendor to ascertain what power feedback interfaces are available.  For ARM systems, all versions of Xen are vulnerable.  The fix restricts access to the AMU (Activity Monitors Unit) interface, introduced in Armv8.4.  For x86 systems, Xen and earlier are vulnerable - master is not vulnerable, as these issues have been addressed in a more general fashion.  The x86 fixes restrict access to:  * Intel RAPL interface, introduced in SandyBridge CPUs.  * Intel platform energy interface.  * Intel perf_ctl interface, introduced in Pentium 4 CPUs and also    implemented by other vendors.  * AMD RAPL interface, introduced in Ryzen/EPYC CPUs.  * AMD compute unit energy interface, present in CPUs.  MITIGATION ==========  There are no mitigations available.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.  Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.
