This is triggerable from within an ODT file. Back then I reported this to libreoffice as well and they patched it in their builds. However on linux systems libreoffice package usually use the system-provided libraptor, so if that's not patched it is vulnerable.  This was unpatched for a long time in many linux distros, in some it still is. Debian+Ubuntu have released updates in the past few days.  It may be interesting to discuss how this happened. From my side I feel I did what I should do - I reported it to the project and later disclosed it publicly on oss-security. Apparently it seems there is no reliable process to make sure publicly reported vulns eventually get patched in distros if there is no active upstream. Maybe noteworthy is that this didn't get a CVE in It seems many distros rely on CVEs to get a process of backporting fixes rolling. Given the fluctuating reliability of CVE assignments not sure this is wise. I have now requested a CVE   Here is a minimal reproducer embedded in an ODT file:  I get an malloc(): invalid size (unsorted) message, which I believe indicates this successfully triggers a heap corruption.   FWIW I recently tried to fuzz raptor again with the fix applied. I quickly found another OOB issue  From the bug report:  A malformed input file can lead to a segfault due to an out of bounds array access in raptor_xml_writer_start_element_common.  Bug happens in line of raptor_xml_writer.c (current git):  From looking at that code it seems to me it always expects nspace_declarations_count to be lower than element->attribute_count, however this input seems to create a different situation. I made an attempt at a patch that throws an error in this situation (but please review it, I am not familiar with what this code does and should do - though the patch doesn't seem to introduce test failures).  (proposed patch, example file and stacktrace can be found attached to the bugreport)  --  Hanno Bรถck https://hboeck.de/  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
