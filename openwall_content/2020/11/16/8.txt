We (Ubuntu security team) have weekly role rotations among the team. The person on CVE triage duty will use our tooling to download  https://cve.mitre.org/data/downloads/allitems.xml.gz etc  We also pull from Debian's security team: https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker.git  We collect CVEs from this list using local mboxes.  We collect CVEs from Red Hat's security announce list: https://www.redhat.com/archives/rhsa-announce/ and oval feeds: https://www.redhat.com/security/data/oval/v2/RHEL8/  Having a variety of inputs gives us some resiliency when one or another service is offline for whatever reason,  I hope this helps.
