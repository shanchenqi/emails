Speaking as a co-maintainer of an understaffed GNU/Linux distribution who fixed this back in I preferred the "old days" when free software security problems were almost always discussed on this list.  While there's no questioning the utility of CVEs in general (Guix can check the CVE list for any given package with 'guix lint -c cve PKG'), there are still unresolved CPE mappings, and I don't know how to get informed of new problems without checking specific (or all) packages.  I tried following the CVE assignment RSS feed initially, but it was not suitable for human consumption.  How do other distros keep up with new CVE assignments?
