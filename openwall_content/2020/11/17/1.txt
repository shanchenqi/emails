SUSE has an internal ticket system like tool that fetches from various sources:  - NVD - SUSE Bugzilla - Oracle CPU CVRF feeds - Redhat, Canonical trackers  And presents this as ticketstyle input.  We have assigned engineers going through all incoming ones, reviewing, associating packages, codestreams and products, and CVSS v3.1 ratings in this tool and opening Bugreports in our Bugzilla for our packagers.  Without some ticketing system like tooling you will not be able to keep up these days.
