Do I understand you correctly: you propose to forbid running X11 clients which processes belong to another users? In that case it is a bad idea: I would like to run untrusted clients with special UIDs. Or if I understand you wrongly, please explain how client of other user can connect to the socket placed in /run/user/$UID with these strict access permissions  --     WBR,    Vladimir D.
