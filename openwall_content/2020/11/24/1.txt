Public release.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  One of the two changes for introduced an on-stack array.  The check for guarding against overrunning this array was off by one, allowing for corruption of the first stack slot immediately following this array.  IMPACT ======  A malicious or buggy HVM or PVH guest can cause Xen to crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) to the entire host.  Privilege escalation as well as information leaks cannot be excluded.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen versions which have the patches for applied are vulnerable.  Only x86 HVM and PVH guests can leverage the vulnerability.  Arm guests and x86 PV guests cannot leverage the vulnerability.  Only x86 HVM and PVH guests which have physical devices passed through to them can leverage the vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  Not passing through physical devices to untrusted guests will avoid the vulnerability.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.  Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.            xen-unstable - Xen  $   $  NOTE CONCERNING SHORT EMBARGO =============================  This issue is likely to be re-discovered as the changes for are deployed more widely, since the issue is also triggerable without any malice or bugginess.  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
