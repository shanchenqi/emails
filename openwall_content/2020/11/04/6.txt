The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * Active Directory Plugin * Ansible Plugin 1.1 * AppSpider Plugin * AWS Global Configuration Plugin 1.6 * Azure Key Vault Plugin 2.1 * Kubernetes Plugin * Mercurial Plugin * SQLPlus Script Runner Plugin * Subversion Plugin * Visualworks Store Plugin  Additionally, we announce unresolved security issues in the following plugins:  * FindBugs Plugin * Mail Commander Plugin for Jenkins-ci Plugin * Static Analysis Utilities Plugin * VMware Lab Manager Slaves Plugin  Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://www.jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  / Active Directory Plugin implements two separate modes: Integration with ADSI on Windows, and an OS agnostic LDAP-based mode.  The LDAP-based mode in Active Directory Plugin and earlier shares code between user lookup and user authentication and distinguishes these behaviors through the use of a magic constant used in place of a real password. This allows attackers to log in as any user if the magic constant is used as the password in Active Directory Plugin and earlier.   / Active Directory Plugin implements two separate modes: Integration with ADSI on Windows, and an OS agnostic LDAP-based mode.  The Windows/ADSI mode does not specifically prohibit use of empty passwords in Active Directory Plugin and earlier. If the Active Directory server allows the unauthenticated bind operation, this allows attackers to log in to Jenkins as any user by providing an empty password.   / Active Directory Plugin implements two separate modes: Integration with ADSI on Windows, and an OS agnostic LDAP-based mode. Optionally, to reduce lookup time, a cache can be configured to remember user lookups and user authentications.  In Active Directory Plugin and earlier, when run in Windows/ADSI mode, the provided password was not used when looking up an applicable cache entry. This allows attackers to log in as any user using any password while a successful authentication of that user is still in the cache.  As a workaround for this issue, the cache can be disabled.   / Active Directory Plugin and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.  This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to access the domain health check diagnostic page.   / Active Directory Plugin and earlier does not require POST requests for multiple HTTP endpoints implementing connection and authentication tests, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.  This vulnerability allows attackers to perform connection tests, connecting to attacker-specified or previously configured Active Directory servers using attacker-specified credentials.   / Subversion Plugin and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.  This allows attackers able to control an agent process to have Jenkins parse a crafted changelog file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.   / Mercurial Plugin and earlier does not configure its XML changelog parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.  This allows attackers able to control an agent process to have Jenkins parse a crafted changelog file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.   / Mercurial Plugin and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.  This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to obtain a list of names of configured Mercurial installations.   / Kubernetes Plugin and earlier includes a feature to replace placeholders in pod template and container template fields with environment variable values.  This feature allows low-privilege users to access possibly sensitive Jenkins controller environment variables.   / Kubernetes Plugin and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.  This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to list global pod template names.   / Kubernetes Plugin and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.  This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.   / Ansible Plugin 1.0 and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods implementing form validation.  This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.   / AWS Global Configuration Plugin 1.5 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint processing form submissions.  This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to replace the global AWS configuration.   / SQLPlus Script Runner Plugin and earlier prints the `sqlplus` command invocation to the build log.  This log message does not redact a password provided as part of a command line argument. This password can be viewed by users with Item/Read permission.   / Azure Key Vault Plugin 2.0 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.  This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.   / AppSpider Plugin and earlier stores a password unencrypted in its global configuration file `com.rapid7.jenkinspider.PostBuildScan.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.  This password can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.   / Visualworks Store Plugin and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.  This allows attackers with the ability to control the output of a script that run Visualworks with StoreCI, or able to control an agent process, to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.   / Static Analysis Utilities Plugin and earlier does not escape the annotation message in tooltips.  This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Job/Configure permission.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / FindBugs Plugin and earlier does not escape the annotation message in tooltips.  This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to provide report files to FindBugs Plugin's post build step.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / Mail Commander Plugin for Jenkins-ci Plugin and earlier stores passwords unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.  These passwords can be viewed by users with Item/Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / VMware Lab Manager Slaves Plugin and earlier stores a password unencrypted in the global `config.xml` file on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.  This password can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
