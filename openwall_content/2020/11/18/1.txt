Since the author wrote that he no longer maintains this project [2] I decided to write here because polipo is widely used in Linux/BSD [3], and there are many maintainers.   Summary =======  It is possible to cause a denial of service through a specific Range header value.   Overview ========  states [4]:  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - A server that supports range requests MAY ignore or reject a Range header field that consists of more than two overlapping ranges, or a set of many small ranges that are not listed in ascending order, since both are indications of either a broken client or a deliberate denial-of-service attack (Section 6.1). ... - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Polipo doesn't ignore/reject the malformed header. Instead, it has an assertion:      assert(from >= 0 && (to < 0 || to > from));  So, a malformed Range header ("Range: bytes=3-2" for example) will cause an assertion failed.  This error handling allows an attacker to cause a denial of service.
