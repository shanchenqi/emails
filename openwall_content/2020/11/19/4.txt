About 3 months ago, a public issue [1] has been reported in the Redmine bug tracker regarding unsanitized HTML tags. This basically means that you can inject any HTML code in issue titles, including JavaScript. I've successfully verified this on Redmine 4.1. There's a (untested) patch attached in the issue.  I've also sent this to the Redmine security team but since there was no response from the maintainers so far and the issue is already public for a long time I'm posting this here to make people aware of it.
