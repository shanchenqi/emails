Description:  In the Linux kernel through there is a array-index-out-of-bounds in fs/jfs/jfs_dmap.c in dbAdjTree and it may cause out of bounds read and Denial of Service.  Root Cause:  the dmtree_t is that  typedef union dmtree {  struct dmaptree t1;  struct dmapctl t2; } dmtree_t;   the dmaptree is that   struct dmaptree {   __le32 nleafs; /* 4: number of tree leafs */   __le32 l2nleafs; /* 4: l2 number of tree leafs */   __le32 leafidx; /* 4: index of first tree leaf */   __le32 height; /* 4: height of the tree */   s8 budmin; /* 1: min l2 tree leaf value to combine */   s8 stree[TREESIZE]; /* TREESIZE: tree */   u8 pad[2]; /* 2: pad to word boundary */  };the TREESIZE is totally  the dmapctl is that: struct dmapctl { __le32 nleafs; /* 4: number of tree leafs */ __le32 l2nleafs; /* 4: l2 number of tree leafs */ __le32 leafidx; /* 4: index of the first tree leaf */ __le32 height; /* 4: height of tree */ s8 budmin; /* 1: minimum l2 tree leaf value */ s8 stree[CTLTREESIZE]; /* CTLTREESIZE: dmapctl tree */ u8 /* pad to */ }; /* - - */ the CTLTREESIZE is totally The dmt_stree was used in dbAdjTree. Since dmt_stree can refer to the stree in both structures dmaptree and dmapctl. the stree size is not consistent, may it cause index out of range.  CVE assigned :  Patch: It's in linux-next now, not available in upstream.  Credit: This issue was discovered by the ADLab of venustech.  Regards.  butt3rflyh4ck.
