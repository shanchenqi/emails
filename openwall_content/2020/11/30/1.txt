Upstream wanted to keep this private until they had something to address it. Originally I raised the following additional concern:      ## General Observations and Recommendations            ### Pairing Procedure          The pairing procedure currently seems lacking. The GUI component only presents     the friendly 'deviceName' to identify peer devices, which is completely under     attacker control. Furthermore the 'deviceName' is transmitted in cleartext in     UDP broadcast messages for all other nodes in the network segment to see.     Therefore malicious devices can attempt to confuse users by requesting a     pairing under the same 'deviceName' to gain access to a system.          I strongly suggest to introduce a secure procedure here, like displaying the     certificate fingerprint to the user.  Upstream addresses this now [1]. A fingerprint of the concatenated public keys of the two involved certificates is displayed. I'm not completely happy with the chosen solution, because in the initial popup only a prefix of 8 hex digits of the fingerprint is displayed. The full fingerprint is only reachable via an additional "view key" button. There are no additional instructions for the end user and no explanation about the severity of trusting a device. At least in theory it is now possible to do a proper peer device verification.  Other discussed approaches to make the verification more user friendly and/or more secure would have been:  - displaying a randomart image in the fashion of ssh-keygen. - scanning a QR code displayed on the PC end using the kdeconnect   Android app. - requiring the user to enter (at least part of) the fingerprint on the   PC end to force proper user interaction. Since the pairing procedure   should not occur very often and given the importance of verifying   device identity this would have been justified.
