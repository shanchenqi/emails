Only Intel processors are affected.  Patches are attached. From cover letter:    vmx_check_intercept is not yet fully implemented by KVM on Intel processors,   causing e.g. the I/O or MSR interception bitmaps not to be checked.   In general we can just disallow instruction emulation on behalf of L1,   but this series also implements I/O port checks.
