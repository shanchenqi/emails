A local unprivileged attacker can abuse this flaw to crash systemd services or potentially execute code and elevate their privileges, by sending specially crafted Dbus messages.  has been assigned to this issue.  This flaw happens due to the way bus_verify_polkit_async() works. Some DBus interfaces use a cache to store objects for a short period and they clear it as soon as the bus is again in the idle state. However, if a DBus method uses bus_verify_polkit_async(), the method may have to wait a while until the polkit action is resolved and when that happens the method handler is called again, with the userdata previously allocated. If the polkit request takes too long, the clearing of the cache would free the stored objects before the method is called the second time, causing the use-after-free vulnerability.  The issue was reported by Tavis Ormandy, Google Project Zero.
