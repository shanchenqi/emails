It could allow some users to read the password hashes.  ﻿On AM, "Matthias Gerstner" <mgerstner@...e.de> wrote:      Hello list,          in the course of a review of the mariadb packaging in the SUSE Linux     distribution I discovered that a SUSE specific helper script     "mysql-systemd-helper" unsafely operates with root privileges in     the /var/lib/mysql directory [1].          During initial package installation and during upgrade scenarios the     file /var/lib/mysql/mysql_upgrade_info is created/overwritten and     modified using the following shell commands:          ```     echo -n "$MYSQLVER" > "$datadir"/mysql_upgrade_info     chmod "$datadir/mysql_upgrade_info"     ```          Since the unprivileged mysql user owns the parent directory it can     remove this file and replace it with a symlink to write/overwrite in     privileged file systems locations. This could mostly be used for     denial-of-service purposes, a full privilege escalation should not be     easily achieved by this vulnerability, since the file content cannot be     controlled by a potential attacker.          Future SUSE mariadb packages will keep this file in a safe location in     /var/lib/misc. Older, still supported packages will be fixed soon.
