You don't need new CVE IDs to describe the > fact that the installer installs vulnerable components.  To echo Simon's points:  Usually, if the code owner (here, the installer's) can fix it in their own code to avoid the vulnerability, then you can reach out to ask for a CVE. That being said, CVE issuing is a subjective science, and the CNA you end up dealing with may decide not to issue one if it is already dealt with in the underlying libraries.
