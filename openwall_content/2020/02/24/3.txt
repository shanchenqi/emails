Just for some added info, Mailman is almost released, the holdup is with some language translations.  Mailman will be the last of the Mailman v2 releases as primary development and effort has long shifted to Mailman v3. Further, the Mailman v2 branch is tied to Python v2, which is now EOL by the fine Python folk.  Once Mailman is release, I'm sure the various distributions will pull the commit and merge the particulars into their release branches, and that will surely include this XSS fix.   I'm not a formal Mailman Developer, but as a contributor and member of the general Mailman Community I say Thank You to Hanno for identifying and reporting  this vulnerability.  -Jim P.
