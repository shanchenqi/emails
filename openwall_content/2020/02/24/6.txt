I would like a bit of clarification. We use OpenSMTPD as a dumb thing that only relays mail to a central server and never delivers it locally. The remote server is under our control.  ============= table credentials { smarthost.example.com=myuser:mypassword }  listen on  # No local mailboxes action to_postfix relay host smtp+tls://smarthost.example.com@...rthost.example.com auth <credentials> helo myhostname.example.com match from local for any action to_postfix =============  Is the hole exploitable in this configuration?  --  Alexander E.
