Turns out the fix in introduced a regression, now found with syzkaller and fixed:   If I understand correctly (but I'm not confident!), this time it's just a crash.  I am not going to request another CVE ID because the security impact is unclear to me (perhaps an Oops with some resources held?)  My sentiment this time:  While embarrassing, it's good to know that this sort of bug (unlike the previous one) is promptly detected by a fuzzer, and thus has a short lifetime.  While ideally there would be no bugs in the first place, realistically I wish more bugs would be discovered and fixed so quickly.  The kernel uses many complicated conventions these days (for performance reasons), up to the point where it's difficult even for the most active upstream developers to make bug-free changes and to review proposed changes.  A lot of context needs to be considered and a lot of potential pitfalls kept in mind.  Thanks to @grsecurity for at-mentioning me on the tweet pointing to the above commit.  I was otherwise out of the loop this time.  That's fine, but since I did bring the previous set of issues in here, I felt I also needed to post this follow-up.
