Questions about this vulnerability can be directed to security@...i.apache.org <mailto:security@...i.apache.org>.  Apache NiFi information disclosure in logs  Severity: Important  Versions Affected: Apache NiFi -  Description: The flow fingerprint factory generated flow fingerprints which included sensitive property descriptor values. In the event a node attempted to join a cluster and the cluster flow was not inheritable, the flow fingerprint of both the cluster and local flow was printed, potentially containing sensitive values in plaintext.  Mitigation: Implemented Argon2 secure hashing to provide a deterministic loggable value which does not reveal the sensitive value. Users running any previous NiFi release should upgrade to the latest release.  Released: February 4,  If you identify new security issues within the NiFi release, please forward your report to security@...i.apache.org <mailto:security@...i.apache.org> and do not disclose the issue publicly.
