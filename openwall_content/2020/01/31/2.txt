An authenticated attacker can abuse this flaw by making multiple disconnect attempts resulting in a permanent leak of a socket connection by radosgw. This flaw could lead to a denial of service condition by pile up of CLOSE_WAIT sockets, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources, preventing legitimate users from connecting to the system.  This flaw affects Nautilus based versions. If Beast front end is in use, switch to CivetWeb to mitigate the issue. Red Hat has assigned and rated as Moderate impact flaw.
