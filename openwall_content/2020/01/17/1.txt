It appears some AMD cpus with RDRAND fail to produce random numbers after a suspend/resume. It looks like it was first reported in or so.  Kernel bug:      *  Systemd bug:      *  Fedora bug:      *  AMD patch:      *  I agree with Lennart Poettering. This seems CVE worthy given RDRAND is often used to get the kernel generator (and other userland generators) in good working order.
