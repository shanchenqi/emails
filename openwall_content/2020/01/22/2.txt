Should we tell the > site owner his site may have been stolen ?  Hmm I never bothered to look deeper into the website but now that you're pointing to it, it looks strange. I can give the upstream author a hint, to check up on his website.  This storeBackup project is near-dead anyways, sadly. There seem to be some die hard fans out there that use it, but the author only manages to send out one email roughly every week. There seems to be no code repository for it so we're getting tarballs - not even patches.  Thank you for the hint. If I get any more information about the situation of the website I will get back to you.
