The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * Amazon EC2 Plugin * Health Advisor by CloudBees Plugin * Redgate SQL Change Automation Plugin * Robot Framework Plugin  Additionally, we announce unresolved security issues in the following plugins:  * Gitlab Hook Plugin * Sounds Plugin  Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  / (CSRF) & (missing permission check) Amazon EC2 Plugin and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods performing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL within the AWS region using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method.  NOTE: This vulnerability might also allow attackers to capture credentials stored in Jenkins. We have not been able to confirm that this is possible.  Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.   / Robot Framework Plugin and earlier does not configure the XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.  This allows a user able to control the input files for the 'Publish Robot Framework' post-build step to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins master, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.   / (CSRF) & (missing permission check) Health Advisor by CloudBees Plugin 3.0 and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods performing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to send an email with fixed content to an attacker-specified recipient.  Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.   / Redgate SQL Change Automation Plugin and earlier stores a NuGet API key unencrypted in job `config.xml` files as part of its configuration. This credential could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the master file system.  This is due to an incomplete fix of   / Gitlab Hook Plugin and earlier does not escape project names in the `build_now` endpoint. This results in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / (permission check) & (CSRF) Sounds Plugin 0.5 and earlier does not perform permission checks in URLs performing form validation. This allows attackers with Overall/Read access to execute arbitrary OS commands as the OS user account running Jenkins.  Additionally, these form validation URLs do not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
