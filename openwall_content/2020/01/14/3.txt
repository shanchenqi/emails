Since the register state is often controlled by lower privilege level (i.e guest kernel/userspace) at the point of the ERET, this could potentially be used as part of a side-channel attack.  IMPACT ======  An attacker, which could include a malicious untrusted user process on a trusted guest, or an untrusted guest, may be able to use it as part of side-channel attack to read host memory.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  System running all version of Xen are affected.  Whether an individual Arm-based CPU is vulnerable depends on its speculation properties.  Consult your CPU vendor.  x86 systems are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  There is no mitigation available.  NOTE REGARDING LACK OF EMBARGO ==============================  This was reported publicly, as affecting other Open Source projects, before the Xen Project Security Team was made aware.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.  Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.            xen-unstable, Xen -      Xen -       Xen 4.9  $     $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----  =FnmX -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
