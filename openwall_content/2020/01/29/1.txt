The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * Jenkins * Jenkins LTS * Code Coverage API Plugin * Fortify Plugin  Additionally, we announce unresolved security issues in the following plugins:  * WebSphere Deployer Plugin  Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  / Jenkins and earlier, LTS and earlier includes support for the Inbound TCP Agent Protocol/3 for communication between master and agents. While this protocol has been deprecated in and was recently removed from Jenkins in it could still easily be enabled in Jenkins LTS and older.  This protocol incorrectly reuses encryption parameters which allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to determine the connection secret. This secret can then be used to connect attacker-controlled Jenkins agents to the Jenkins master.   / Jenkins and earlier, LTS and earlier supports two network discovery services (UDP multicast/broadcast and DNS multicast) by default.  The UDP multicast/broadcast service can be used in an amplification reflection attack, as very few bytes sent to the respective endpoint result in much larger responses: A single byte request to this service would respond with more than bytes of Jenkins metadata which could be used in a DDoS attack on a Jenkins master. Within the same network, spoofed UDP packets could also be sent to make two Jenkins masters go into an infinite loop of replies to one another, thus causing a denial of service.   / Jenkins and earlier, LTS and earlier does not use a constant-time comparison validating the connection secret when an inbound TCP agent connection is initiated. This could potentially allow attackers to use statistical methods to obtain the connection secret.   / Jenkins and earlier, LTS and earlier does not use a constant-time comparison when checking whether two HMACs are equal. This could potentially allow attackers to use statistical methods to obtain a valid HMAC for an attacker-controlled input value.   / Jenkins shows various technical details about the current user on the `/whoAmI` page. In a previous fix, the `Cookie` header value containing the HTTP session ID was redacted. However, user metadata shown on this page could also include the HTTP session ID in Jenkins and earlier, LTS and earlier.  This allows attackers able to exploit a cross-site scripting vulnerability to obtain the HTTP session ID value from this page.   / Jenkins includes a feature that shows a JVM memory usage chart for the Jenkins master.  Access to the chart in Jenkins and earlier, LTS and earlier requires no permissions beyond the general Overall/Read, allowing users who are not administrators to view JVM memory usage data.   / Jenkins and earlier, LTS and earlier does not serve the `X-Frame-Options: deny` HTTP header on REST API responses to protect against clickjacking attacks. An attacker could exploit this by routing the victim through a specially crafted web page that embeds a REST API endpoint in an iframe and tricking the user into performing an action which would allow for the attacker to learn the content of that REST API endpoint.   / Code Coverage API Plugin and earlier does not escape the filename of the coverage report used in its view.  This results in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability that can be exploited by users able to change the job configuration.   / Fortify Plugin and earlier stored its proxy server password unencrypted in job `config.xml` files. This password could be read by users with the Extended Read permission.   / WebSphere Deployer Plugin and earlier does not configure the XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks. This could be exploited by a user with Job/Configure permissions to upload a specially crafted war file containing a `WEB-INF/ibm-web-ext.xml` which is parsed by the plugin.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
