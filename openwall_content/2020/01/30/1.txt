We have assigned two IDs for them.  The patches fixing those issues are linked to below.  Issue 1) Score: 7.3 (High) - CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C * Vendor: Qt Project * Product: Qt * Versions affected: to * Versions fixed: (already released), (future) * Issue: local attack, loading and execution of untrusted code * Scope: class QPluginLoader (qtbase/src/corelib/plugin/qpluginloader.cpp) * Description: QPluginLoader in Qt versions through would search for certain  plugins first on the current working directory of the application, which  allows an attacker that can place files in the file system and influence the  working directory of Qt-based applications to load and execute malicious code.  This issue was verified on macOS and Linux and probably affects all other Unix  operating systems. This issue does not affect Windows.

Issue 2) Score: 7.3 (High) - CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C * Vendor: Qt Project * Product: Qt * Versions affected: through * Versions fixed: (released), (future) * Issue: local attack, loading and execution of untrusted code * Scope: class QLibrary (qtbase/src/corelib/plugin) * Reference: * Description: QLibrary in Qt versions through on certain x86 machines, would  search for certain libraries and plugins relative to current working directory  of the application, which allows an attacker that can place files in the file  system and influence the working directory of Qt-based applications to load  and execute malicious code. This issue was verified on Linux and probably  affects all Unix operating systems, other than macOS (Darwin). This issue does  not affect Windows.
