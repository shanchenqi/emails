Typically, the service obtains the public key from a local keystore (JKS/PKCS12) by specifing the path of the keystore and the alias of the keystore entry. This case is not vulnerable.  However it is also possible to obtain the keys from a JWK keystore file, by setting the configuration parameter "rs.security.keystore.type" to "jwk". For this case all keys are returned in this file "as is", including all private key and secret key credentials.  This is an obvious security risk if the user has configured the signature keystore file with private or secret key credentials.  - From CXF and it is mandatory to specify an alias corresponding to the id of the key in the JWK file, and only this key is returned. In addition, any private key information is omitted by default. "oct" keys, which contain secret keys, are not returned at all.  Mitigation:  Users of Apache CXF that user the OpenId Connect JWK keys service as part of their OpenId Connect service should update to either the or releases.
