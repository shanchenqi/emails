Due to the fact that target files must be in a very specific format, exploitation of this flaw to escalate privileges in a realistic scenario is unlikely."  - Local privilege escalation via CDE dtsession "A buffer overflow in the CheckMonitor() function in the Common Desktop Environment and earlier and 1.6 and earlier, as distributed with Oracle Solaris 10 (Update 11) and earlier, allows local users to gain root privileges via a long palette name passed to dtsession in a malicious .Xdefaults file."  Please find the advisories attached to this email.
