Just copying and pasting from the Red Hat bug:   It was reported [1] that a patch added to Python 3.2 [2] caused a race condition where a file created could be created with world read/write permissions instead of the permissions dictated by the original umask of the process.  This could allow a local attacker that could win the race to view and edit files created by a program using this call.  Note that prior versions of Python, including 2.x, do not include the vulnerable _get_masked_mode() function that is used by os.makedirs() when exist_ok is set to True.   [1] [2]   Our bug is here:  Could a CVE be assigned to this issue please?  Thank you.  --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
