Christey" <coley@...re.org> To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: JBoss EJBInvokerServlet/JMXInvokerServlet confusion   There are several CVEs related to the lack of authentication for JBoss invoker servlets, but there's a bit of confusion and a likely duplicate.  is associated with various Red Hat advisories that mention JMXInvokerHAServlet and EJBInvokerHAServlet - with "HA" in the name - in JBoss.  The description for is currently focused on HP products, but it mentions EJBInvokerServlet and JMXInvokerServlet (different servlets without "HA" in the name).  Through the associated ZDI advisory, this issue is associated with some exploit(s) authored by Andrea Micalizzi (rgod), who reported the issue in various products that utilize JBoss.  In addition, - "Does affect Red Hat JBoss products?" - clarifies that these servlets are "exposed without authentication on older, unsupported community releases of JBoss AS (WildFly) 4.x and 5.x."  is used heavily with references to  The openness of JMXInvokerServlet is covered in a disclosure in although EJBInvokerServlet is not mentioned then.  The key question is whether is a duplicate of an existing CVE that covers EJBInvokerServlet and JMXInvokerServlet, and if so, which CVE is it a duplicate of.  It is not a duplicate of since that deals with the exposure of different servlets - the "HA" servlets - so is effectively a variant of the original issue.  is heavily used.  Although it does not mention  EJBInvokerServlet or JMXInvokerServlet, it is related to insecure JBoss  configuration.  None of the commonly-associated references mention  EJBInvokerServlet and JMXInvokerServlet, either.  If we can clearly link  with those servlets, then it becomes possible to reject  as a duplicate.  Original links such as http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=SecureJBoss are now gone, which is unfortunate because this is a "bridge reference" that is included in both and Red Hat's "Does affect Red Hat JBoss products?" article. https://community.jboss.org/wiki/securethejmxconsole doesn't name the servlets.  There is, at least, a Metasploit module that maps to and calls JMXInvokerServlet:  https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/multi/http/jboss_invoke_deploy  There's still a question of EJBInvokerServlet - I haven't seen it mentioned in conjunction with yet.  Also, it appears that there are mentions of other vectors besides servlets, e.g.  Red Hat, can you confirm that the scope of is the lack of authentication for both JMXInvokerServlet and EJBInvokerServlet?   - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
