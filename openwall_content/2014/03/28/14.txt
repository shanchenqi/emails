The existence of separate source trees does not affect the number of CVE IDs.  >  "Apache Tomcat 7 and Apache Tomcat 8 use a packaged renamed copy of Apache Commons FileUpload" in that reference is sufficient for us to use only one CVE ID. We do not rely on factors such as whether the code has become non-identical or whether different persons are maintaining the two copies of the code.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =mlQ2 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
