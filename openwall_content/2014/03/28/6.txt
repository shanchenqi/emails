Slightly different attack. The attacker (who knows their own password and chooses the reset-to password) was able to cause a logged out user (victim) to login with the attacker's account via the change password form.  This attack is somewhat specific to mediawiki since we allow users to define JavaScript that will be loaded on pages they visit while logged in... So the victim in this case would run the attacker's personal JavaScript.  > > Are you saying that Mediawiki has a logic bug (some form of > authorization bypass) allowing any authenticated user to change someone > else's credentials without knowing them?
