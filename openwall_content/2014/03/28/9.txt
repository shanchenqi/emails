We can (and do) refresh the user's session id as part of the login process. We could refresh the user's session every time the user visits that form, and the PoC on the bug would still work.  The PoC on the bug shows that a non mediawiki domain can make a POST to the mediawiki domain to login an anonymous user as the attacker.  Using the definition from owasp, "CSRF is an attack which forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which he/she is currently authenticated" this satisfies the part that an attacker is taking unwanted action on behalf of the victim. If you want to argue that "logging in" is inherently an action by an unauthenticated user and so it doesn't meet they "in which he/she is currently authenticated" then I'm happy to not call this CSRF. However we did call the same attack a "login CSRF" for the nearly identical issue and a very similar    > > > This attack is somewhat specific to mediawiki since we allow users to > > define JavaScript that will be loaded on pages they visit while logged > > in...
