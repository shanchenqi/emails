Sorry for offtopic.  What are the delays in the delivery in  Fyodor's Full Disclosure list?  On several occasions I noticed significant delays in delivery of my emails, including on the mirror.  Today at  I tried to post  to fulldisclosure@...lists.org, now is EET and neither I received the message nor it is on the mirror.  On the old FD it was very fast for me.  "lightly moderated" is not far away from "lightly pregnant" IMHO.  10x.
