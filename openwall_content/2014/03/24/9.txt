The library implements the Java API for XML Processing (JAXP) which supports a secure processing feature for interpretive and XSLCT processors. The intent of this feature is to limit XSLT/XML processing behaviours to "make the XSLT processor behave in a secure fashion".  It has been discovered that the secure processing features suffers from several limitations that undermine its purpose. The enabling of the secure processing feature in fact still allows the following processing to take place:    * Java properties, bound to XSLT 1.0 system-property(), are accessible.   * output properties that allow to load arbitrary classes or resources     are allowed   * arbitrary code can be executed if the Bean Scripting Framework (BSF)     is in the classpath, as it allows to spawn available JARs with secure     processing disabled, effectively bypassing the intended protection.
