During the past year or two, we initiated quite a few embargoes for  mostly uninteresting bugs (denial of service, huge inputs required,  obscure software or configuration).  We did this mainly out of courtesy  for others, but we recognize the overhead an embargo causes.  In  retrospect, I'm not sure if we always made the right choice.
