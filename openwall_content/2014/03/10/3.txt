At least some hardening measures have been implemented now:  Made "4 times" harder in by these two patches:  commit Author: Florian Westphal <fw@...len.de> Date:   Fri Sep 20      tcp: syncookies: reduce cookie lifetime to seconds          We currently accept cookies that were created less than 4 minutes ago     (ie, cookies with counter delta 0-3).  Combined with the 8 mss table     values, this yields 32 possible values (out of that will be valid.          Reducing the lifetime to < 2 minutes halves the guessing chance while     still providing a large enough period.          While at it, get rid of jiffies value -- they overflow too quickly on     32 bit platforms.          getnstimeofday is used to create a counter that increments every 64s.     perf shows getnstimeofday cost is negible compared to sha_transform;     normal tcp initial sequence number generation uses getnstimeofday, too.  commit Author: Florian Westphal <fw@...len.de> Date:   Fri Sep 20      tcp: syncookies: reduce mss table to four values      Halve mss table size to make blind cookie guessing more difficult.     This is sad since the tables were already small, but there     is little alternative except perhaps adding more precise mss information     in the tcp timestamp.  Timestamps are unfortunately not ubiquitous.      Guessing all possible cookie values still has 8-in chance.
