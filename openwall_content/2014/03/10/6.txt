When thinking about this issue, I like to refer to: time the behavior of the program violates the users intent in a way which compromises their security, that's a security issue. To that end, any of a-d, IMO, ought to quality for a CVE, the only acceptable way to expose functionality like this is LegacyObviouslyBrokenZipEncryption.
