Content Copying: Not Allowed." Possibly the easiest way to do automated translation would be OCR.  The primary issue is that the nature of the product availability is outside the scope of CVE. The vendor response states that the availability was a first demonstration and that the target audience was the security community. When providing CVE assignments, what we're looking for is software that is, roughly speaking, intended to be used and not simply tested. This varies from product to product. For some open-source projects, this means that the vendor must make a release intended for typical end users. For other open-source projects, it is known that unreleased software (e.g., from a git master branch) is directly incorporated into commercial products from time to time, and thus the lack of a release by the project maintainers isn't critical. This second case doesn't seem to apply to the Uhuru Mobile product.  In the first case, if a vendor hires a specific security consultant to do a vulnerability assessment of an unreleased product, neither the consultant nor the vendor is eligible to obtain CVE assignments for this work. (People do occasionally try.) Similarly, if there isn't a specific security consultant, and the vendor instead is trying to engage any interested person in the security community, CVE assignments aren't made.  We also have other comments about the disclosure:  > Vulnerability #2 - Embedded kernel vulnerable to (local > root)  > Vulnerability #3 - Embedded kernel vulnerable to > (master key)  Even if this were a released product, there wouldn't be separate CVE assignments for instances of and Those IDs would be used directly.   > Vulnerability #1 - Whitelist of executable applications bypass: > ---------------------------- > The Android kernel was modified and "hardened".

Based on section 2.2, our understanding is that the vendor believes this is resultant from "shell obtenu auparavant." (Admittedly, the vendor apparently plans to address this anyway as an additional security-hardening measure. See the end of the "2. Pour les librairies" section.)   > bruteforce it if it is encrypted  In section 2.6, the vendor apparently believes that 16-character alphanumeric PIN values are a mitigation.   Finally, in section 2.1, the vendor apparently asserts that the attack is possible only when following a process that is contrary to the installation instructions.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =loZz -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
