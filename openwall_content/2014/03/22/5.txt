These vulnerabilities were detailed in a blogpost [1]. Vulnerability #1 - Whitelist of executable applications bypass:----------------------------The Android kernel was modified and "hardened". A feature was implemented to only allow a whitelist of binaries to be executed. This can be bypassed by using, for example, the LD_PRELOAD environment variable. Vulnerability #2 - Embedded kernel vulnerable to (local root)----------------------------The embedded Android kernel version is which is vulnerable to This can be exploited to obtain root rights. Vulnerability #3 - Embedded kernel vulnerable to (master key)----------------------------The embedded Android kernel is vulnerable to This can be exploited to bypass the APK signature system of Android. Vulnerability #4 - Local escape shell vulnerability----------------------------When the phone is encrypted, it uses the passcode entered by the user to decrypt/encrypt files. The passcode entered by the user is executed as root inside a shell command without being filtered. An attacker just have to reboot the phone, and once the phone asks for the passcode, enter the payload aka s/Please enter your passcode/Please enter your payload/ . This can be exploited to gain local code execution as root. Eric Filiol, the main creator of the project, responded [2] (in french) to the reported vulnerabilities.
