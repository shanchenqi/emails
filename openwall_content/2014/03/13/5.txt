This seems to be an opportunity for security improvement, not a vulnerability. It appears that the design goal was to listen for commands in a way that could be acceptable on a server with sufficiently restricted access, and not acceptable in arbitrary environments. "port where the load balancer listens for commands" seems sufficiently descriptive for a reasonable person to immediately wonder who can send commands. Furthermore, the example in question:    sudo pen -C  suggests that the person is aware that "a control port" means a TCP port, not some other type of port with obvious permission-based restrictions. A CVE assignment could be made if there were an implementation error (e.g., the user specifies listening on but the code actually listens on all interfaces). A CVE assignment might also be possible for some types of design problems, but they'd need to be considerably more surprising and the documentation would need to be considerably more misleading.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =nmY2 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
