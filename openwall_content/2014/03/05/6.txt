I'm happy to agree with that (as the maintainer of the drivers/staging/ tree).  Please note, that if a user does use a staging tree driver, it will "taint" the kernel with the "TAINT_CRAP" flag, and tell the user that they are on their own.  But I'm not in charge of CVEs, if people are looking to create a ton of them, feel free to assign them to staging tree driver issues... :)  thanks,  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
