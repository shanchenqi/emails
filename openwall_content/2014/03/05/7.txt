"file can be made to crash" is typically not security-relevant on its own (a user can recover from this by not continuing to run file on the same crafted file). We're not sure whether any distribution has packages that rely on server-side use of libmagic, or whether it's common to have long-running processes that use libmagic with untrusted input.  "apt-rdepends --reverse file" gave some hints that resulted in these possibilities, but the actual use of file (or libmagic) within these packages was not investigated:    https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/bacula-director-sqlite3    network backup service - SQLite 3 storage for Director    The Bacula Director service supervises all the backup, restore,   verify, and archive operations. It can run as a daemon    dep: file     https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/guestfsd    This package contains a standalone version the back-end daemon that   carries out file system access on behalf of libguestfs applications.    dep: file  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =a0pY -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
