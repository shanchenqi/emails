[...]  Thanks for the CVE assignment and also for the clarification about when a CVE might be assigned. I do not have a concrete example of such an application, although php5 for example is embedding a copy of libmagic/file which is used.  One question about the CVE ID, as the bug was submitted on should that have recieved a CVE?
