The code is much smaller and easier to audit (and tcb works with OpenPAM). OpenBSD is doing well with the BSD auth and gain the same as with PAM (plugins via /usr/libexec/auth/*). BSD auth is only three C core files:   So it might be a better 'patch' than bloated Linux-PAM.  btw. I'm thinking about porting BSD auth API to Linux/tcb.
