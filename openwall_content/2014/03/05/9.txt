In other words, although something like:    - struct icmp_msg_mib   + struct icmp_msg_mib  would often be an independent security fix is an unusual size), here it's not a security fix relative to the original code. If other analysis shows that that's incorrect, we'll add another CVE ID.  Use for the missing input validation.   > 2. net-snmp: snmptrapd crash when using a trap with empty community string > > >  Use  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =BxeE -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
