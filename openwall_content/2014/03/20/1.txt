Time for new one  I agree about BB. To generalize your concerns: trust no one. Even a honest person running mailing list can be compromised say via blackmail/torture. If you run a mailing list stuff like spam, DDOS, legal threats will eat from your time.  The death of the Full Disclosure list is mystery to me too. I don't think the last FD mail explains it fully. Suspect deeper conspiracy than just the google thread.   On Wed, Mar 19, at gremlin@...mlin.ru wrote: > On Dean Pierce wrote: >  >  > Hosting?
