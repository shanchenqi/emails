Once the source skb is consumed, ubuf destructor is called and potentially releases the corresponding userspace buffers, which can then for example be repurposed, while the destination skb is still pointing to the them.  This issue is similar to  Upstream patch:  Thanks, --  Petr Matousek / Red Hat Security Response Team PGP: AF16 F9AF  77CA  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
