Time for new one (or  something better!)  Interesting idea :)  How hard is to implement?  Some human will be in technical charge. How resistant is this against dishonest operator?  Suggestion:  make the project easy to install and import the DB in case it dies too for whatever reasons.  Why not implement all alternatives?  This might cause duplicate traffic.  So far several alternatives are:  1. Public service mailing list (easy) 2. Standard mailing list (legal issues) 3. coderman's solution 4. forum or Question&Answers site (might support email)    On Thu, Mar 20, at coderman wrote: > a modest and proportionate proposal, >  > fuller-disclosure: >  - a hidden list (local accts only, no clearnet linkage) >  - a hidden daily digest (per mod prefs, see below) >  - a hidden xmpp (otr required - plaintext abused) >  - a hidden web archive (of the list traffic, read-only) >  - a hidden public chat (group xmpp+/|ircd, no clearnet linkage) >  - a hidden pastebin with or without simple nonce auth >  - a advogato reputation sys to stack rank and put below the fold >    (for list digest content, public chat, web archive, and public pastes) >  > use case A: "JerkVendor is Jerk" >  - more accomodating disclosure fails, >     good faith and gratis effort returned with bile. >  - bugtraq drama ensues, takedowns. >  - "Hey, the advisory is still up here! ->  fullerd.onion/..." >  > use case B: "The Hot Drop" >  - *whispers* 'remember the Athens Affair? i'd rather not Opt-Out to report' >  - BREAKING NEWS: "Anonymous russian hackers drop dox on spyhack to > darknet fullerd.onion..." >  > use case C: "It's my party and I'll..." >  - 'so how it happened was, >     , i coaxed pre-auth SSL cert parsefail remote exec with escalate to system' >  - "Hey DEF CON! fuck that full-disclosure closure drama, >     let's get this party started!" >  - DEF CON XX official start and group xmpp/ircd distributes nonce for > 0day to thousands of hidden participants simultaneously. >     [ remainder of distribution happens over sneakernet at con >       due to unexplained outage across entire Tor network for all users... ] >  >  > not a concern at all, ever: >  - "HOLY SHIT TAKE THAT DOWN NOW!!!" legal motions >  - "HOLY SHIT TAKE THAT DOWN NOW!!!" supporter/peer pressure >  - "HOLY SHIT TAKE THAT DOWN NOW!!!" matters of national security >  - "HOLY SHIT TAKE THAT DOWN NOW!!!" hint in datagram at > [ the inverse is use case D: Peace of Mind" ] >  >  >  > i don't see the point in anything less; other technologies filling > existing roles fine, while the truly necessary drops have zero outlet. >  > . > . > . > finding someone with strong reputation and good judgement to publicly > validate and speak to the efforts of the equally reputable but > absolutely anonymous service operator? > ... now that's a hard sell ...  *grin*  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
