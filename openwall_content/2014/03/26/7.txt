This is a  security problem because it means that a malicious server can disable SSHFP- checking by presenting a certificate. Note that users are still presented the  well-known "host verification prompt".  Given the prompt will and the still rather peripheral reliance on SSHFP, we  consider this an issue of low severity.  Please assign a CVE name for this issue.
