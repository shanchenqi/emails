There is no CVE ID for the issue in which the documentation might not be sufficient to prevent all problematic uses of pam_timestamp in conjunction with remote services. The documentation at http://www.linux-pam.org/Linux-PAM-html/sag-pam_timestamp.html and elsewhere specifically mentions "This is similar mechanism which is used in sudo" and "FILES /var/run/sudo/..." in fairly prominent ways. The documentation is not directly misleading, i.e., there doesn't seem to be any implication that a remote service is a recommended use case.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =dQxv -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
