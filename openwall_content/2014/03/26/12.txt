The library is affected by a heap-based buffer overflow which can lead to arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability is caused by lack of proper expansion for the string passed to the yaml_parser_scan_uri_escapes() function.  A specially crafted YAML file, with a long sequence of percent-encoded characters in a URL, can be used to trigger the overflow.
