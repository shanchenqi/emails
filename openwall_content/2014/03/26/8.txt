CVEs are as follows: parallels: Sanity check for s->tracks parallels: Fix catalog size integer overflow qcow2: Check maximum L1 size in qcow2_snapshot_load_tmp() qcow2: Fix L1 allocation size in qcow2_snapshot_load_tmp() qcow2: Fix NULL dereference in qcow2_open() error path block: Limit request size dmg: prevent chunk buffer overflow dmg: sanitize chunk length and sectorcount qcow2: Fix new L1 table size check qcow2: Avoid integer overflow in get_refcount qcow2: Don't rely on free_cluster_index in alloc_refcount_block() qcow2: Validate active L1 table offset and size qcow2: Validate snapshot table offset/size qcow2: Check refcount table size qcow2: Check backing_file_offset qcow2: Check header_length curl: check data size before memcpy to local buffer.  vhdx: Bounds checking for block_size and logical_sector_size vdi: add bounds checks for blocks_in_image and disk_size header fields vpc: Validate block size vpc/vhd: add bounds check for max_table_entries and block_size bochs: Check extent_size header field bochs: Check catalog_size header field bochs: Use unsigned variables for offsets and sizes block/cloop: refuse images with bogus offsets block/cloop: refuse images with huge offsets arrays block/cloop: prevent offsets_size integer overflow block/cloop: validate block_size header field  Patches are available here:  Patches will be in the upcoming QEMU 2.0 release and a QEMU stable release is also planned.
