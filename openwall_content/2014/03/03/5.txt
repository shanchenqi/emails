As the stated purpose of encryption is to strongly protect communications, both integrity (e.g. modification) and confidentiality (e.g. not being able to read it) then using encryption such as DES can be broken in single digit seconds (I'm guessing near real time now with dedicated hard ware) and hours on standard PCs obviously violates the stated intent of using encryption.  So the question becomes where do we draw the line? 40 and 56 are obviously weak, standard computers, let alone something with a GPU can crack it quickly. Do we draw the line at bits, <3DES or something else?   - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =IRqF -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
