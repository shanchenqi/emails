Upstream bugreport:  > Some corrupt PE executables contain invalid offset information in > their internal directories that libmagic attempts to follow and run > string searches on. mcopy() does not do bounds checking on the > indirect offset read from the file and sets up ms->search with invalid > pointers and lengths. >  > The offending line in my case is the msdos magic file is > MSCF \b, InstallShield self-extracting archive >  > The offset read indirectly was invalid and its bounds were not checked > in mcopy.  Upstream has fixed this with following commit:   Can a CVE be assigned for this issue?
