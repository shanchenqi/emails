Note: Not part of KDE and not speaking on their behalf, but...  IMO SSL on KDE needs some pretty big love. Pretty sure I've discussed this and  other aspects of SSL with the relevant people at KDE before but as with many  aspects of KDE, noones really had time to tackle it. Basically. Konqueror  doesn't really deal with SSL, that's delegated down the stack which ends up  with OpenSSL. There's a lot of oddities in KDEs SSL more generally but the  original KSSL author has abandoned it (IIRC), and no one has really stepped up  to fill the slack.
