The date of a report to a private list does not directly affect the date portion of a CVE ID. However, there was an apparently public commit in that mentioned "the daemon crashed."  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  mTgCBHrzOxHqo9X1VsaKYCsFwjccS/LZcGuQOwkuLZzZwilfzxhzwbFHqQITigbG =1aqs -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
