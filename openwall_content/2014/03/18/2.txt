On Fedora > double quotes were > needed.  The recent upstream patch:     addressed the ' issue using the '\\'' approach.  has:      expanded.replace( QRegExp( "%p" ),                       "\"" + QString::fromLocal8Bit( item->url() )  + "\"" );     expanded.replace( QRegExp( "%n" ),                       "\"" + QString::fromLocal8Bit( item->name() ) + "\"" );  As mentioned in the post, attempted use of " for this type of quoting is a conceptually different problem than attempted use of ' for this type of quoting, even if both attempts are ultimately incorrect.  (We did not try to check whether the upstream version made a change from incorrect use of " to incorrect use of ' at some point. This could be considered an incomplete fix.)  Use for the vulnerability involving use of " (as shown in the above calls to expanded.replace). This CVE assignment applies to any upstream code or any Fedora-specific code that has this specific issue.  Use for the vulnerability involving use of ' (as shown in the above https://bitbucket.org commit).  If anyone happens to identify a version of the code that does not attempt any type of quoting, a third CVE assignment may be possible.  > (And maybe it should be escaping ';' too if not already?)  This would typically not be addressed as a separate fix.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =lGmu -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
