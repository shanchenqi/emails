By doing repeated requests, with sufficient load on the target system, an authenticated user may in certain situations assume another authenticated user's complete identity and multi-tenant authorizations, potentially resulting in a privilege escalation. Note that it is related to a bad interaction between eventlet and python-memcached that should be avoided if the calling process already monkey-patches "thread" to use eventlet. Only keystone middleware setups using auth_token with memcache are vulnerable.  python-keystoneclient fix (included in release):  References:  --  Tristan Cacqueray OpenStack Vulnerability Management Team     Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
