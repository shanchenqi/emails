See for example "Attendees agreed that CVE should include problems in beta software, provided that the beta code was intended for public dissemination" in the post.  The CVEs of interest to the community tend to be ones that are "common" -- in other words, they are present at multiple sites, and a CVE ID would actually be used (typically in multiple contexts) as the mechanism for naming and tracking the vulnerability.  For the specific case of staging drivers, a relevant example is "this driver is enabled in the Debian 6.0 kernel" for:       So, any background about the discovery would be helpful, e.g., is the driver enabled in a distribution, or is someone shipping a Linux-based appliance or device that relies on the driver. The full list is substantial -- http://cateee.net/lkddb/web-lkddb/STAGING.html seems relevant although that's a third-party presentation and not directly the primary source.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =wMyp -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
