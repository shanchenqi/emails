Two issues were recently identified as security concerns in libmagic: (infinite recursion flaw) & (improper bounds checking).  What is the policy regarding CVE allocation for products vulnerable by virtue of bundling copies of vulnerable products (as opposed to, say, linking vulnerable system libraries)?  I bring this up because PHP embeds a copy of libmagic which it uses in its fileinfo extension. PHP has since patched its embedded libmagic to address above-mentioned issues: [1],[2].  In the event this merits separate CVEs, please allocate.  If not, this thread can serve to clarify MITRE policy regarding inherited vulnerabilities as well as provide a heads up for vendors shipping PHP.  Thanks.  --mancha  Upstream PHP Fixes: [1]  [2]    Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
