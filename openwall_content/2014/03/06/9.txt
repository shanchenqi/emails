Comprehensively tracking the introduction of new protection mechanisms and new security features across all browsers is not directly in the scope of CVE. There are a number of cases described either in older documents such as http://code.google.com/p/browsersec or newer documents such as http://www.strews.eu/results/5-web-platform-security-guide in which some browsers have chosen to block a type of attack whereas others have not. At the moment, these types of "competitive analysis" CVE requests may be deferred. In other words, CVE isn't really "about" a product suddenly transitioning from non-vulnerable to vulnerable solely because its development effort has lagged behind its competitors in a sufficiently important way for a sufficiently long period of time. The author of a product is free to announce software mistakes, and there may be opportunities for CVE assignments in cases of new codebases lacking a security feature that was already more-or-less ubiquitous before the software was written.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =1SBL -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
