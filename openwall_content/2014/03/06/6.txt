This was reported and fixed silently in so it would need a  CVE name.  (This issue is not specific to cloud-init, there seem to be some wget  scripts out there which exhibit the same behavior, but it's probably  some custom stuff that's not distributed anywhere, so no CVE is needed  for that.)  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
