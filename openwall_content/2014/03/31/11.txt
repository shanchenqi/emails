Or secure storage of content?   This is a good way to frame the question.  It isn't clear to me, in this specific instance, how the tokens are used or how an attacker could mess with the ciphertext.  This is simply because I'm too busy to read up on the issue.  However, in general, here's the typical assumptions developers make about encryption (with ECB mode) and how the implementation fails to meet those:  1. ECB mode encryption provides secrecy     - Partially fails this assumption since repeated plaintext blocks      result in repeated ciphertext blocks   2. ECB mode encryption provides integrity     - Badly fails this assumption since ciphertext blocks can be      duplicated/swapped, rearranged at will.  If due to the context of      the encryption, if an attacker can conduct a partial      chosen-plaintext attack, typically whole ciphertexts can be      forged.   So depending on the context, it is clear that this could qualify for a CVE in a well-defined way.  tim  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
