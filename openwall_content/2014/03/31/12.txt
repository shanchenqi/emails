The GOST block cipher celebrates its' 25-years jubilee this year. First published in it's one of the oldest (if not the most) of all symmetric block ciphers which are currently in use.  Original publishing describes possible key sizes of 32, 64, and bits. However, the internal representation of key data consists of 32 subkeys of 32 bits each - for example, when the bits key is split into 8 subkeys k0...k7 of 32 bits each, the internal keys are:  int: 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07  08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 sub: k0 k1 k2 k3 k4 k5 k6 k7  k0 k1 k2 k3 k4 k5 k6 k7  int: 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23  24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 sub: k0 k1 k2 k3 k4 k5 k6 k7  k7 k6 k5 k4 k3 k2 k1 k0  (see  But now, the bits and 1 kbit keys come to scene... For bits key split into 16 subkeys k0...kF, the internal keys are:  int: 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07  08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 sub: k0 k1 k2 k3 k4 k5 k6 k7  k8 k9 kA kB kC kD kE kF  int: 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23  24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 sub: k7 k6 k5 k4 k3 k2 k1 k0  kF kE kD kC kB kA k9 k8  and for 1 kbit key the internal keys are, obviously, just  Also, the number of rounds for bits and 1 kbit keys encryption will be increased up to 48 and 64 respectively.  This makes GOST the second (after Threefish) block cipher capable of using bit and 1 kbit keys. Together with its' resistance against superpipelined bruteforcing (rumoured to be effectively used somewhere in South-Eastern Asia to break Rijndael), that means the "old horse" is still running.  The updated standard will get the new GOST registry number from the GOST-R 34.xxx series and is expected to be published till the end of  So... Let's wait for its' appearance in OpenSSL :-)   --  Alexey V.
