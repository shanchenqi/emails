There is a code in check_tty() that handles '/': 	if (strchr(tty, '/') != NULL) { 		... 		tty = strrchr(tty, '/') + 1; 	}  > Any occurence of "." inside tty name should be evil.  Strange - yes, but why evil?  > Above strcmp() matches exactly "." or "..", > but you also want "../../" etc which should pass above check.  After commit 9dcead8, check_tty() handles all such cases.  > For the ruser check, the strchr(ruser, '/') safes this, but > ".." occurence may also be treatened appropriately.  Commit 9dcead8 also makes get_ruser() reject "." and ".." as invalid ruser values.   --  ldv  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
