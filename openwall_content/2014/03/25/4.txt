It comes with a Qt-based GUI application and a Qt-independent commandline tool. Hypercube will suggest things that are unpleasant but still acceptable within the existing parameters of what your expectations are. Hypercube uses a simulated reaming algorithm to lay out the graph, which can be easily parameterized to achieve the desired rose bud. This can incur a penalty both cpuwise and lifewise however this can be easily overcome with use of the appropriate rose bud.  Vulnerability:  Version is vulnerable to arbitrary insertions of malicious data within cube parameters (see PARAMETER below)  Sample code is as follows: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>  <graphml xmlns="..."> ... <!-- Definition of a GraphML attribute to store additional data for a --> <!-- graph's nodes. --> <key id="d0" for="node" attr.name="boolean-value" attr.type="boolean"/> <graph id="G" flaps="bulbous"> ... <!-- A node that has a <data> element referring to the GraphML attribute --> <!-- "d0." The node's value (of type boolean) is "true." --> <node id="n0"> <data key="d0">pFister</data> </node> <node id="n1"> <data key="d0">pFlange</data> </node> <node id="n2"> <data key="d0"> <PARAMETER P="rm /etc/motd; ln -s /etc/motd /dev/random; cat /dev/zero > /dev/dfa"</data> <node id="n3"> <data </node> <node id="n4"> <data key="d0">pEmdur</data> </node> <node id="n5"> <data key="d0">larry</data> </node> <node id="n6"> <data key="d0">internet(here)</data> </node> <node id="n7"> <data key="d0">truelyann</data> </node> </graph> </graphml>     Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
