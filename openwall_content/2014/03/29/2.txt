Injection attacks (whether that's XSS, SQLi, ...) happen when there's a misunderstanding (for one of the parties) in between what's data and what's meta-data.  Regarding XSS, in my books, if it's a browser-plugin (greasemonkey) doing the injection, that's fine. If it's the user (your example) that's fine too (but some people disagree : see https://www.facebook.com/selfxss ).  If it's the server doing it, it's a vulnerability as there's just no way of doing it "securely".  > However, this means that Login CSRF becomes a big security issue because it > would allow me to add evil JS to my account and then force the browser of > someone else to execute it in the context of the MediaWiki server's domain.  I had a look at how mediawiki generates its CSRF token... a smiley is worth a thousand words. :XD  -> includes/User.php:getEditToken  "Anon" users (whatever that is) share a token (EDIT_TOKEN_SUFFIX). Others have their pseudo-random "secret" hashed and stored in their session... and it's spit out using "return md5( $token . $salt ) . EDIT_TOKEN_SUFFIX;"  Few lines below is the function called matchEditToken(), *lazily* evaluating the above against what it receives on the wire.  I won't bore you with the details, but the above is very unlikely to be okay. In no particular order: -) according to the above, "Anon" users share the same CSRF tokens -) the attacker can force a session (and its secret) onto a user: ever heard of http://www.php.net/manual/en/session.idpassing.php ? (grep tells me that neither session.use_only_cookies nor session.use_trans_sid are set) -) the way the tokens are generated and compared is not okay (lazy comparison in PHP, no constant time comparison, hash-length-extension attacks, ...)  There's definitely a bunch of CVEs that could be assigned, but fundamentally the security model of mediawiki can't work as long as that "feature" exists.  I'll let someone else in the community pick it up from there. Ultimately I'm not the one assigning CVEs... and probably won't be bothered enough to put a PoC together. So I'll just GTFO ;)  Florent  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
