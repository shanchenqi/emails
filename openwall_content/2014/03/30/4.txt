It is conceivable that nothing has yet been shipped with that patch.   >  > The shell command "umask" calls to get the current umask, > and then call umask() with result of the first call.  There is no CVE assignment yet for any shell, or other program, that uses the approach in a multithreaded environment. There is perhaps an open question of how (or if) the current umask should be determined. For example, calling is arguably a vulnerability in some cases, calling could possibly cause other undesirable behavior during races, simply not checking the umask and providing false data to the user is problematic as well, etc.   >  > We can probably document that makedirs(exists_ok=True) leaves the > directory permission unchanged if the directory already exist,  There is no CVE assignment for the issue of whether the permissions of an existing directory after makedirs(exists_ok=True) are consistent with the previous permissions, consistent with the current umask, or randomly selected (?) from between those two options. Also, there is no CVE assignment for whether a permission mismatch should be an error condition. Unless there were documentation that was directly misleading, this seems to be mainly a usability question.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =zUkt -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
