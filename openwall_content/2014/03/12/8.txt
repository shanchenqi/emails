Thanks for letting the list know.  As far as I can see, you tried posting to the Penetration Testing list, but got no replies:   I'm not sure what this means: too little demand for a list with such focus, or specifically the Penetration Testing list being non-working.  Either way, I'm also not sure if we want to expand the scope on oss-security to cover topics like this.  Probably not.  Bob, it's not great that you posted this follow-up as a forward rather than as a reply to the same thread and with proper quoting.  This makes the follow-up appear as a new thread in the archives of oss-security, whereas the thread that you started before does not contain this additional follow-up.  Please be more careful with _how_ you post to mailing lists.  http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/anton/mail-news-errors.html http://www.netmeister.org/news/learn2quote.html  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
