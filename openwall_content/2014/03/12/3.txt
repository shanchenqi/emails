Note that CURLOPT_CAINFO doesn't do proper pinning - this won't work with a CA-issued certificate unless the CA certificate was in the file too, as the host certificate would contain the CA:false basicConstraint.  That CA could issue another certificate for the host and it would be accepted.  Disabling SSL_VERIFYPEER is as obviously broken as an inetd service calling gets(). An author's claim that this is fine runs counter to users' expectation that enabling TLS provides security.
