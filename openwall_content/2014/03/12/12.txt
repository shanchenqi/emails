For example, the HTTP protocol specification doesn't require that a server validate that the Host header has the expected "host" or "host:port" syntax and otherwise send an error status code. If that were required, then there would only be one CVE.  Here, the issues could have been fixed independently, e.g., SQL injection fixed in mod_mysql_vhost.c, and then directory traversal fixed in the mod_simple_vhost_docroot function in mod_simple_vhost.c and the mod_evhost_parse_host function in mod_evhost.c. This could conceivably have been chosen if someone wanted mod_simple_vhost.c/mod_evhost.c to have access to the original string (maybe anticipating that "Host: host/pathname" could become meaningful for vhosts in a future HTTP protocol revision, or whatever).  So, there are two CVE assignments:  SQL injection - use path traversal - use  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =TjxJ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
