Many bearer token systems have this security property, which is also shared with (e.g.) Kerberos tickets.  I think it's a security property to be aware of, but I don't think it's a vulnerability unless the software advertises otherwise.  Invalidating issued tokens prior to their expiration time requires storing central session state or some revocation list equivalent, which may be an undesireable or burdensome requirement for the security system as a whole. Bearer tokens with expirations but without central session state (Kerberos, for example) have some useful properties that cannot be easily replicated by state-tracking systems, at the cost of making logout prior to token expiration require destruction of all session keys.  --  Russ Allbery (eagle@...ie.org)              <http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/>  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
