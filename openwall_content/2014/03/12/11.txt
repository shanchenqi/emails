There are no CVE assignments specific to that report, but is related.  > Made "4 times" harder in by these two patches:  This may be best interpreted as a security-hardening step that was made as a tradeoff against other possible functionality goals. Those types of issues typically don't have CVE assignments. It's not, for example, a case of the Linux kernel security team announcing this as a vulnerability fix. (We're not suggesting that the Linux kernel security team needs to change anything about announcement approaches.)  One of the side issues is:     says:    This patch slows down the timer used in syncookies from Hz to Hz   so that at any moment only two differrent timer values can be accepted.    This changes the maximum cookie age limit from 4 - 5 minutes to 4 - 8 minutes.  but the actual accepted patch was:       tcp: syncookies: reduce cookie lifetime to seconds  If we understand this correctly, this is a direct tradeoff against usability on slow network connections, possibly including connections to the moon or Mars. Admittedly a different protocol or other tuning might be needed for successful network sessions to Mars; the point is that the patch is a behavior change that may often make spoofing more costly, but is not really a "fix for a vulnerability." The blog post suggests that even the patched code could realistically allow a successful spoof within much less than an hour.  Similarly, suggests other tradeoffs in other parts of the changes, e.g.,    Some services are secure enough at application level and don't   care at all about TCP connection spoofing. These can use the   sysctl to revert back to the MSS table we have now (or anyting   that better serves their traffic).    Other services are not so secure and some MSS values can be   sacrified to mitigate the risk. With a smaller MSS table, tuning   the values for specific traffic may make even more sense.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =/J2Y -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
