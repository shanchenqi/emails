The issue is mitigated by the fact that unix_chkpwd is only used to check the user's own password, when unlocking an X desktop or GNU screen (when it's patched to use PAM).  Another "mitigation" is that X desktop locking is generally fail-open anyway. ;-(  Someone might want to patch this issue in Linux-PAM.
