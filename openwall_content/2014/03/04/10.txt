Firefox, elinks, midori and curl all refuse one way or another.  I didn’t test any more.  Apart from chrome, those are all on Fedora 20.  I agree that the connections being so trivially decryptable represents a flaw that should be fixed.  jch  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
