I think it deserves one and as recently Konqueror issues popped up here I thought it might deserve a CVE:  Basically, pretty much all mainstream browsers support the X-Frame-Options header to allow web developers to secure their apps from clickjacking attacks. Konqueror doesn't support it.  Please assign CVE.  (and if curious: I've setup a test for X-FRAME-OPTIONS header functionality a while ago http://int21.de/frametest/ )  cu, --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
