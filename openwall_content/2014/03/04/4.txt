What happens is that after a fragment has been added to the hash chain but before it's been added to the lru_list (inet_frag_lru_add), it may get deleted (either by an expired timer if the system load is high or the timer sufficiently low, or by the fraq_queue function for different reasons) before it's added to the lru_list, then after it gets added it's a matter of time for the evictor to get to a piece of memory which has been freed leading to a number of different bugs depending on what's left there.
