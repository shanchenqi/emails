When a trustor issues a trust token with impersonation enabled, the token is only added to the trustor's token list and not to the trustee's token list. This results in the trust token not being invalidated by the trustee's token revocation (bulk revocation). This is most noticeable when the trustee user is disabled or the trustee changes a password. Only setups using the memcache backend for tokens in Keystone are affected.  Icehouse (development branch) fix:  Havana fix:  Grizzly fix:  Notes: This fix will be included in the icehouse-3 development milestone and in future and releases.
