If a KDC serves   multiple realms, certain requests can cause setup_server_realm() to   dereference a null pointer, crashing the KDC.    CVSSv2: AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P/E:POC/RL:OF/RC:C   The scope of is this part of    A related but more minor vulnerability requires authentication to   exploit, and is only present if a third-party KDC database module can   dereference a null pointer under certain conditions.   The practical relevance of the second CVE is that, based on the available information, a KDC apparently can be vulnerable to even if the exploitation conditions are not met. The vendor's disclosure binds the ID only to a subset of the comment. This was accompanied by a similar binding within third-party references such as in the Red Hat Bugzilla. It is conceivable that someone would want to track even if they determined that was not relevant to their installation.  In general, even if a single patch could address two distinct types of attacks, that does not necessarily mean that two CVEs are duplicates.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =oIex -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
