A misconfigured server might only offer a 40-bit cipher to a peer that offers a 40-bit cipher, but might offer a stronger cipher to a peer that does *not* offer any 40-bit ciphers.  arguably, this involves two different misconfigurations (both server and client), but the issue would be mitigated if the client was not offering a weak cipher and claiming it was a successfully secure connection.  Here is another situation where konqueror successfully indicates a "secure" connection to a server that has a known-insecure configuration:  point konqueror at: https://demo.cmrg.net/ -- you'll see a successful connection, though that server only offers DHE over a trivially-crackable 16-bit group.  NSS-based browsers will throw an ssl_error_weak_server_ephemeral_dh_key error and refuse the connection; konqueror claims it is a secure connection.  	--dkg   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
