Attempting to use KDirStat to permanently delete a  directory that has a malicious name could result in arbitrary command  execution.  Original report:  The Debian report is about single quotes. On Fedora  double quotes were  needed.  Can a CVE please be assigned if one has not been already? (And maybe it  should be escaping ';' too if not already?)
