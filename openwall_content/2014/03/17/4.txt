The problem is present in  code only runnning on Windows when using the schannel SSL backend. It is very  similar to the Mac-specific curl problem Apple registered for,  but for another backend and platform.  I don't think it is a good idea to "pile up" another bug on an existing CVE so  a new one is probably needed.  For this reason, I do not request this on distros@ or linux-distros@ since  this problem does not affect any opensource distro. This is for an open source  product executing on Windows.  We intend to announce the full details in sync the pending curl release on  March 26.  --     / daniel.haxx.se  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
