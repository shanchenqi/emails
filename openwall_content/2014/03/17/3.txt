Instead, we need to use &_dh as the forth argument so that     we're copying the data into an actual buffer that sits on the stack.          Currently, we probably could overwrite memory on the stack (e.g.     with a possibly mal-formed DCCP packet), but unintentionally, as     we only want the buffer to be placed into _dh variable.  is already in original commit on March 20, in  Ciao, Marcus  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
