We know that people want (at least) data confidentiality when they opt to use an "encryption" feature. Why play word games? A failure to help people understand what is available and what is not available leads to vulnerabilities. We can no longer pretend that UX is unrelated to technical security concerns.   --  http://noncombatant.org/  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
