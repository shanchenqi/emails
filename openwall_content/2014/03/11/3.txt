Actually, there are multiple contexts in which people use the ZIP encryption feature when they're not looking for confidentiality. Here's a sample help page from a university IT department:    https://wiki.csuchico.edu/confluence/display/help/Blocked+E-mail+Attachments+File+Types    Our filters are unable to scan files within a password   protected .zip archive. When the filters encounter a protected   .zip file, a warning message is appended to the original   message and is passed through with the attachment in tact. If   you need to send or receive a file type on the blocked list,   you can protect the .zip file with a password and supply the   password in your message in order for your recipient to open   the file. If you need to receive one of these files, you can   forward instructions for your sender to do the same.  Because the password is included in the message, this is obviously not a solution to address confidentiality. (In general, some mail systems intentionally allow encrypted ZIP files for this functionality reason. Some mail systems intentionally block encrypted ZIP files because they are, on the whole, more likely to be malicious than unencrypted ones.)  Other references about essentially the same approach:      "If you block say .exe files ... if someone really wants to send the    file, they can in almost all cases just zip the file instead in an    encrypted zip file we couldn't scan"      "Our organization needs to be able to send and receive otherwise    banned content (exe,bat,dll, etc...) via a password encrypted ZIP    archive."  We previously mentioned the use case of sending virus samples to anti-virus vendors. This still occurs and was discussed in some blogs last month:       Again, the password is well known, and thus the goal isn't confidentiality. Some major vendors recommend or support this, e.g.,    http://www.mcafee.com/us/threat-center/resources/how-to-submit-sample.aspx     https://ers.trendmicro.com/guide/en_us/AG/Help/Sending_Suspicious_Files_to_Trend_Micro.htm  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJTHqkWAAoJEKllVAevmvmswRIIALJd/mBpEKMQ9vCetaKfDNTC =NYwQ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
