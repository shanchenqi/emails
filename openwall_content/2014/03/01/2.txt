This qualifies for a CVE because there is known client software that uses this namespace in a way that results in XSS. MediaWiki is obviously free to make an announcement of a security fix for this type of issue, independent of the question of who is at fault for the underlying problem.  > Also disallow iframe elements.  There is no CVE assignment for this change because there is no known client software that uses any of the $validNamespaces namespaces in a way that results in XSS. A third party who "owns" one of these namespaces, or anyone else, could modify its role tomorrow and (for example) release a browser extension that's vulnerable to this IFRAME XSS attack when the namespace is used. However, defending against that is essentially the same as defending against any other attack requiring not-known-to-exist client software. It can only be interpreted as security hardening. For example, MediaWiki conceivably could validate uploaded .jpg files by looking for photos of the word "IFRAME" because, well, you can't be too careful.   > >  > * (bug SECURITY: Make token comparison use constant time.
