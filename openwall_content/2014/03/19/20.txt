This creates an attack vector for XSS attacks.  Use  The basis of this CVE assignment is that the rack-ssl product is apparently accepting some level of responsibility for the behavior of adapters. The commit message in wasn't really worded in the form of a vulnerability-fix announcement. There's another interpretation in which it would be categorized as security hardening to work around XSS vulnerabilities in adapters. The commit message mentions jruby-rack. https://github.com/jruby/jruby-rack/blob/master/History.txt includes ... refactored / updated error handling ... unify exception handling across decorating app factories with support for configuring exception handling with the *jruby.rack.error* option." Perhaps this means that jruby-rack is less likely to have a patch that makes XSS impossible because the jruby-rack developers want exception handling to be fully configurable? In any case, an additional CVE assignment for jruby-rack could be made if the jruby-rack developers want one. That might, for example, cover the case of using jruby-rack with an unpatched version of rack-ssl.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =wXBE -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
