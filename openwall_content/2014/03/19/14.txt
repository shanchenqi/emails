New release of TigerVNC fixes an issue with boundary checks in the ZRLE decoding.  Boundary checks existed in the code in form of assert()s, which were removed in builds with NDEBUG defined.  That is default for release builds done by cmake, which is used by TigerVNC.  This could possibly allow malicious server to compromise vncviewer.  The same problem may affect related *VNC implementations if built with NDEBUG.  was assigned to the issue.
