I was partially kidding and in addition have low opinion of CVE.  Sure.  Even though most threads in here mention CVE, they also contain plenty of technical info that is desirable regardless of one's opinion of CVE.  So you could consider treating or ignoring your CVE allergy (just skip the mentions of CVE, look at the rest of what the same messages say), and then you might find the content in here useful and/or worth commenting on (just except for the CVE aspects, which are obviously not your type). ;-)  Regarding new FD:  > If you ask me there should be no moderation/kickbans. > IMHO this isn't effective against alleged trolls. > Back in the time I was against banning n3td3v. >  > Maybe some sound daily quota is reasonable though.  Makes sense to me.  I hope whoever chooses to setup the new FD will consider this idea.
