Time for new one  Hosting?  That's what the cloud is for.  I have no idea who runs https://groups.google.com/group/FullDisclosure  but they seem modeled after original fd charter.  I trust Google as a neutral third party more than I would trust most security researchers.  They already host all the old newsgroup archives.  It's also free, easily consumable, and most importantly, babysat for security issues in a way that even a team of skilled volunteers would have a hard time pulling off.    - DEAN  On Wed, Mar 19, at AM, Georgi Guninski <guninski@...inski.com> wrote: > What is the number of email addresses who > posted on FD? > > (to roughly estimate cost of hosting) > > On Wed, Mar 19, at Georgi Guninski wrote: >> Apologies for posting on list mainly dedicated >> to CVE's. >> >> The Full Disclosure mailing list died today: >> http://lists.grok.org.uk/ >> >> >> I suppose it is time for a new list. >> >> Any ideas? >> >> -- >> guninski  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
