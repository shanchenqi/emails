Have a look at the big picture. If Google censors a vuln in a google-related service on such a list, they will get massive criticism, and for a business, that's even worse.  A vuln in a Google service? That's a mistake. Intentional censoring by Google in a place where they're supposed to be a neutral third party? That's evil. And "Google made a stupid mistake" in the headlines is much better for them than "Google did something evil". They won't do it, not just for ethical reasons, but also because censoring is bad for their money.   >  > They already host all the old newsgroup archives.
