I would like to request a CVE for the following vulnerability:  Summary -------  An SSL stripping vulnerability was discovered in Trojitá [1], a fast Qt  IMAP e-mail client. *User's credentials are never leaked*, but if a user  tries to send an e-mail, the automatic saving into the "sent" or "draft"  folders could happen over a plaintext connection even if the user's  preferences specify STARTTLS as a requirement.  Background ----------  The IMAP protocol defines the STARTTLS command which is used to  transparently upgrade a plaintext connection to an encrypted one using  SSL/TLS. The STARTTLS command can only be issued in an unauthenticated  state as per the IMAP's state machine.  RFC also allows for a possibility of the connection jumping  immediately into an authenticated state via the PREAUTH initial response.  However, as the STARTTLS command cannot be issued once in the authenticated  state, an attacker able to intercept and modify the network communication  might trick the client into a state where the connection cannot be  encrypted anymore.  Affected versions -----------------  All versions of Trojitá up to 0.4 are vulnerable.  The fix will be included in version (to be released after the CVE  gets assigned).  Remedies --------  Configurations which use the SSL/TLS form the very beginning (e.g. the  connections using port are secure and not vulnerable.  Possible impact ---------------  The user's credentials will *never* be transmitted over a plaintext  connection even in presence of this attack.  Because Trojitá proceeded to use the connection without STARTTLS in face of  PREAUTH, certain data might be leaked to the attacker. The only example  which we were able to identify is the full content of a message which the  user attempts to save to their "Sent" folder while trying to send a mail.  We don't believe that any other data could be leaked. Again, user's  credentials will *not* be leaked as they are never transmitted under this  scenario.  Acknowledgement ---------------  Thanks to Arnt Gulbrandsen on the imap-protocol ML for asking what happens  when we're configured to request STARTTLS and a PREAUTH is received, and to  Michael M Slusarz for starting that discussion.
