Whether that is true or not, this has absolutely nothing to do with whether the technical content of the "CVE request" messages and follow-ups to them is valuable or not.  I think it is valuable.  Also, if you're concerned of MITRE possibly providing non-public vulnerability feeds to somewhere, that concern obviously does not apply to the public CVE requests made on this list.  Regarding new FD:  > Is it reasonable to use a public service for the list -- > outsourcing legal stuff?  I think it's reasonable to try, but with an external service you probably won't be able to impose the daily quota per sender that you suggested.  > Running a mirror/torrent is much easier than running > a mailing list, so even if stuff gets deleted it will > be in the mirrors.  OK.  You mentioned hosting costs.  I think a $20/month VPS will do.  Perhaps AWS "free tier" will do as well (IIRC, it's free for the first year). It's not related to how many people or e-mail addresses have posted (the statistic you asked for), but rather to the number of subscribers, to the amount of spam coming to the posting address (and to other related addresses, such as list admin's and even list robot's, as you must minimize backscatter) that you'd have to filter out, and to the acceptable mail delivery delays (a bigger server will let you do more concurrent deliveries, so the delays will be less - if you do configure the number of concurrent deliveries according to server capacity).
