At least in theory, this could have been resolved by reporting an error when LuaAuthzProvider is found in a directory context, rather than by using the actual approach to add the functionality.  So, it may be reasonable to interpret this as a non-security bug that occurs when an administrator intentionally enters httpd.conf content that is, according to the documentation, invalid.  We notice that says "waiting to see if a CVE should be assigned." The usual process for CVE assignments for Apache Software Foundation products is:    http://www.apache.org/security/committers.html  Here, we realize that the issue was sent directly to the oss-security list, but MITRE doesn't have enough information to make a final decision. The Apache Software Foundation can decide whether the erroneous LuaAuthzProvider handling is a vulnerability from the perspective of their security policy.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =cmIE -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
