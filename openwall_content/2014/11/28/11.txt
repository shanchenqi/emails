No, it does not require LuaAuthzProvider in the wrong context to produce the vulnerability with the parameters.  When LuaAuthzProvider appears only in server/vhost context it defines an authorization provider -- say "my-provider".  You can then use "my-provider" wherever "Require" is valid (everywhere).  Wherever you use it with "Require my-provider", you can also pass an argument.  For example if your provider did the same task as mod_authz_goupfile you might pass the path of a group file, or the name of a group to lookup (or both with some delimieter).  If you did this twice with different arguments, the script in each context receives the last-defined argument.  So if you configure and tested "Require my-provider admins-only", then configured and tested  "Require my-provider guest" in another context, you'd end up with mixed-up args passed to the first provider.  > We notice that > says > "waiting to see if a CVE should be assigned."

It was first disclosed publicly in an online comment in the httpd manual. Since it did not seem very sensitive, I copied it to a public bugzilla before asking for a CVE privately from security@...che.org. Since it had already been public (twice), the security team said I should initiate it via oss-security@ to avoid duplicates.  If you'd like security@...che.org to allocate the CVE despite it having been discussed publicly, please confrm here.   Thanks.
