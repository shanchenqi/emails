It uses caching files (/dev/.blkid.tab or /run/blkid/blkid.tab) to store info about the UUID, LABEL etc it finds on certain devices.  However, it does not strip " character, so it can be confused to build variable names containing embedded shell metas, which it would usually encode inside the value.  Given an USB stick with /dev/sdb1 you can:  # mkfs.ext4 -L 'X"`/tmp/foo` "' /dev/sdb1 # blkid -o udev /dev/sdb1 ID_FS_LABEL=X__/tmp/foo___ [...]  Seems to be OK, but invoking blkid a second time, taking the cache in effect:  # blkid -o udev /dev/sdb1 ID_FS_LABEL=X ID_FS_LABEL_ENC=X ID_FS_`/tmp/foo` "" UUID=... [...]   "blkid -o udev" is often used in root context via udev or in automounters (uam-pmount) to construct key=value environment variables inside shell scripts which are then evaluated. Might be possible to construct an embedded LD_PRELOAD= as well for the binary case.  By injecting > character one can probably construct whole fake cache entries.
