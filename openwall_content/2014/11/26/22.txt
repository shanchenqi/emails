Wheeler" <dwheeler@...eeler.com> To: "oss-security" <oss-security@...ts.openwall.com> Subject: Apple goto fail - lessons that should be learned  I recently looked at Apple's "goto fail" vulnerability revealed back in February this year, to see what could or should have been done to find the vulnerability BEFORE the code was released to users. You can see the result here:  http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/apple-goto-fail.html  As always, if there are additional measures, let me know.  I've previously done this exercise with: * Heartbleed: http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/heartbleed.html * Shellshock: http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/shellshock.html * POODLE: http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/poodle-sslv3.html  My hope is that everyone involved in software development and/or security analysis will get better at countering or detecting vulnerabilities *before* they get out to users.  Learning from the past seems like a way to help get there.  --- David A.
