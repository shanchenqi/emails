For the others, in addition to the post, "Michael Meeks from officesecurity@...ts.freedesktop.org indicated that they are not interested in CVEs for DoS-only crashers" is also relevant. This has multiple possible interpretations, e.g., "not interested" because their security team won't track the issues using CVEs, or "not interested" because they are not vulnerabilities. The "is a security issue because it takes down all other windows with it" is often relevant to CVE because it represents a default security policy if there is no information from a vendor about their security policy. However, a vendor is free to establish a security policy such as "if you are working with a potentially untrusted file, you MUST NOT have any other windows open in which you are maintaining state about your other editing work." In other words, they can define all DoS-only crashers to be applicable only in unsupported use cases.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =dyEX -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
