Project website: http://codezen.org/canto-ng/ Affected versions: All versions prior to Debian version affected: Canto was later removed from Debian. Versions (wheezy) and (squeeze) are not affected with this payload. Upstream fix: PoCs attached from the original advisory email. OSVDB:  Reported in Debian BTS by <the_walrus_88@...lymail.net>. Quoting the mail:  """ I have just found a command line injection security vuln in canto. The program fetches feeds from configured sites, and the feeds contain URLs that people may want to visit. If a user starts canto and chooses to go to one URL from one feed, canto constructs a sh command line to visit the URL, but it doesn't remove metachars. Therefore a malicious feed (owner turned bad, man in the middle attack if fetched with http) can put in bad data in all link and guid elements of the feed and use this to hack the user when they visit some of the URLs. Not good. See my conf.py and evil.rss files for an example. Sorry for my English!
