There's no filtering out of any CVEs logged about LibreOffice that might be considered not significant.  Again, from our side, when presented with DoS documents we do tend to push back against granting them security bug status. Not that we don't think they are serious, just that we think they don't merit extra special (time expensive) security level handing. I *think* was issued/requested directly by the discoverer high-tech bridge security research. Maybe it initially looked a bit more serious than it turned out.  In other cases e.g. the affected application is really Apache OpenOffice not LibreOffice but the same document that corrupts AOO causes us to deref a NULL and fall over so it got listed there because we people asked about it, given our shared code base origin. (maybe something similar was also the case for I forget, it was years ago)  C.
