Use  It seems fairly clear that "blkid -o udev" is attempting to create lines that are safe sh input. Or, more specifically, the expectation is that the lines would be directly usable. We currently don't see a reasonable alternative interpretation that blkid is simply attempting to provide output lines that accurately reflect strings found on device media, and is expecting that other components will make a security determination about each line, before using that line as sh input. Also, the blkid maintainer has apparently made other changes relating to quoting of strings found on device media:     (we understand that it's not completely analogous). Finally, http://git.kernel.org/cgit/utils/util-linux/util-linux.git/tree/misc-utils/blkid.8 says 'print key="value" pairs for easy import into the udev environment' and those security determinations would probably not be considered "easy import."  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =1Rws -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
