I don't feel it's a valid reason without clearly documenting such an approach in documentation intended for users (and for security researchers).  Then, in Moritz Muehlenhoff writes: "For an application profile such as an office suite handing out CVE IDs to crash/CPU overload bug w/o potential of code injection is a waste of time and impractical". This is ambiguous as there are different office suite with different behabvior in regard to crashes. E.g., crashed instance of AbiWord doesn't take other windows with it.  Then, there is autosaving in LibreOffice. By default it's triggered every 15 minutes. Hence only the last 15 minutes (or less) of work in all windows is lost when a crash (or cpu load bug) happens (in default configuration). This can also affect assessment of crashes as non-/security issues. But it will be nice to explicitly state why and which issues are considered non-/security.   > "Michael  > Meeks from officesecurity@...ts.freedesktop.org indicated that they  > are not interested in CVEs for DoS-only crashers" is also relevant.  > This has multiple possible interpretations, e.g., "not interested"  > because their security team won't track the issues using CVEs, or "not  > interested" because they are not vulnerabilities.  I guess it will be better for folks from LibreOffice to comment on this directly.   > The "is a security  > issue because it takes down all other windows with it" is often  > relevant to CVE because it represents a default security policy if  > there is no information from a vendor about their security policy.  Yes, that's what I got from your earlier emails. Thanks for confirming it.   > However, a vendor is free to establish a security policy such as "if  > you are working with a potentially untrusted file, you MUST NOT have  > any other windows open in which you are maintaining state about your  > other editing work." In other words, they can define all DoS-only  > crashers to be applicable only in unsupported use cases.  And a vendor can even establish a security policy such as "you MUST NOT work with potentially untrusted files". It's not ideal but it's better to have a policy which accurately reflect the real situation. (The example is speculative, I don't imply anything about the real situation with LibreOffice.)  Unfortunately I don't see any such policy stated anywhere. One of the natural places for it would be the page dedicated to security in LibreOffice: https://www.libreoffice.org/about-us/security/ . But it doesn't touch the question of security policy. Instead, it links to the list of security advisories: https://www.libreoffice.org/about-us/security/advisories/ , which happily lists several DoS issues: IMHO this reaffrims the default security policy.  I don't see any security policy in the Help too.  --  Alexander Cherepanov  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
