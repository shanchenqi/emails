A local user with access to tun or macvtap devices, or     a virtual machine connected to such a device, can cause a denial     of service (system crash).      This update includes a bug fix related to that     disables UFO (UDP Fragmentation Offload) in the macvtap, tun, and     virtio_net drivers. This will cause migration of a running VM from     a host running an earlier kernel version to a host running this     kernel version to fail, if the VM has been assigned a virtio     network device. In order to migrate such a VM, it must be shut     down first.  The bug report with a few more details is here:     We believe this is specific to Debian's Linux 3.2-based backport series.
