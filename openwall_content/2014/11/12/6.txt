BIND 9 is supposed to filter such garbage from upstream answers, but  there are other resolvers out there which will pass through such answers  unchanged, so this is very much CVE-worthy.  (This systemd component is optional, I strongly recommend not to ship  it.  It's not even possible right now to dump the cache contents to  debug such issues.)  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
