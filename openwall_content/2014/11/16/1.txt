It's a telling story about the state of some of the free software projects involved and I can only encourage others to join the effort to find bugs via fuzzing. Some of them are really low hanging fruit. I'm cc-ing cve-assigners, I leave it up to you to decide which you assign CVEs. If you want / need more info on details please ask.   Imagemagick: Multiple issues in PCX, DCM parser and generic issue in resize code http://www.imagemagick.org/script/changelog.php These already got CVEs:  GraphicsMagick: Fork of Imagemagick, so some of the above also affect it, tests with the same fuzzed sample set turned out one independent other issue: Heap Overflow / oob read One more issue with PNGs that turned out to be weird, it caused an error message to overflow:  elfutils: Checks done with the set of files that crashed binutils turned out one issue: Invalid read american fuzzy lop found a couple more: and more:  GIMP: Invalid reads in import plugins for fli and tga.  claws-mail / gdk-pixbuf Assert in gdk-pixbuf when trying to load a malformed file as an animation. This was an accidental discovery when I clicked on a malformed PNG I send while reporting another issue (in graphicsmagick) in my mail client (and it crashed with an assert).  file/libmagic: out of bounds read when parsing JPG header  ndisasm: Actually I found this by running ndisasm on /dev/urandom - no joke! Crash / oob read:  less: Out of bounds read, upstream doesn't answer and doesn't have a public bug tracker. This wasn't really found by fuzzing but by running less on a likely malwared gif, I reduced it to a smaller testcase: http://int21.de/cve/less-oob  cu, --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
