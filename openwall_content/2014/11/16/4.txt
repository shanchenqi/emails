I agree with Michal on this. It's like saying Ritchie's fault for the fact that C does not have inbuilt bound checking, allowing for buffer overflows...  I won't really expand on this, but my opinion is that _any_ program that is 'trusted', such as `file' and `strings', that contains a flaw in it that could pwn the running user, is a security risk.  I'll also add, from the `file' manpage: >   There has been a file command in every UNIX since at least Research > Version 4 (man page dated November,  The System V version introâ >      duced one significant major change: the external list of magic > types.

And one last point.. `vlc' is used with untrusted input(i.e .mp4s, avis, mp3s, etc.). If somebody gets pwned because they try to watch a video they download, is it their fault?..
