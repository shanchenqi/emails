Cashdollar" <larry0@...com> To: Open Source Security <oss-security@...ts.openwall.com> Subject: Wordpress WP-DB-Backup Plugin Remote Database Backup Download  Vulnerability  Hello List,  So I had been tinkering with the WP-DB-Backup plugin that uses security through obscurity to hide the location of the wordpress database backups it creates.  The advisory with PoC I had been working on is here:    I contacted the plugin author with my advisory and my proposed fix. The author acknowledged my work, but I never heard from him again.  Turns out Matthew Bryant had already covered everything I had but a few months ago here:  http://thehackerblog.com/auditing-wp-db-backup-wordpress-plugin-why-using-the-database-password-for-entropy-is-a-bad-idea/  We arenât sure if this is CVE worthy, it seems since the database is exposed one only needs to guess the database name in order to succeed besides a bunch of brute forcing stuff. :-)  I thought I would see what you folks had to say.   Thanks Larry Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.  Confused about mailing lists and their use?
