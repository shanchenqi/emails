There is a local DoS in pip 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, and In an attempt to fix pip modified it's build directories from pip-build to pip-build-<username> and added in checks that would ensure that only a directory owned by the current user would be used. However because the build directory is predictable a local DoS is possible simply by creating a /tmp/pip-build-<username>/ directory owned by someone other than the defined user. This issue has also been reported to the Debian bug tracker as  This has been fixed[3] in the develop branch of pip which will be released as pip 6.0.   I am not aware of any previous CVE for this issue.
