I'd consider "few hours of afl-fuzzing" not to be low hanging fruit, but opinions may differ on that (I'm currently only focusing on software where I get the crashers within minutes).  But appart from that: The first bug is marked as fixed but no indication is given whether the fix went upstream. Did you do that or should it be reported to gettext?  (Actually that's also a thing I also see far too often - bugs get reported somehow in public, but the reports don't arrive at the appropriate upstreams)  --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
