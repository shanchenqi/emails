ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Acceleration support for the "REP MOVS" instruction, when the first iteration accesses memory mapped I/O emulated internally in the hypervisor, incorrectly assumes that the whole range accessed is handled by the same hypervisor sub-component.  IMPACT ======  A buggy or malicious HVM guest can crash the host.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen versions from at least 3.2.x onwards are vulnerable on x86 systems. Older versions have not been inspected.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only PV guests will avoid this issue.  There is no mitigation available for HVM guests.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.         xen-unstable, Xen 4.4.x, Xen 4.3.x             Xen 4.2.x  $   $  We have been told that this patch is not sufficient on Xen 3.3.x and earlier without also backporting (git commit id).  Note that while we are happy to share information we receive about earlier Xen versions, the earliest Xen branch for which the Xen Project offers security support is 4.2.x. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =8eF1 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
