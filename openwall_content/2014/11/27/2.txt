OTOH I didn't imply that you somehow filtered the page or something.  (The list of CVEs indeed looks suspicious -- such a large project cannot  have so little CVES. But that's another question.) Nevertheless the pair  of pages (.../security/ and .../security/advisories/) looks misleading.  2. In fact, I don't care too much if you treat DoS documents as security  issues or if CVEs are assigned for them. I don't yet have a strong  opinion about it. What bothers me is the disconnect between an assumed  and a real security (and security process) of LO. If you have a security  policy which is not default I think it should be clearly communicated to  an end user.  3. IMHO the usual use-case for LO is to open untrusted files in various  formats and I thought that security of LO would be akin to the one of  browsers. For comparison, I was aware that `strings` has some problems  but the situation with LO took me by surprise. Perhaps it's just me (I  don't use LO actively). Actually, hints are there: LO in Debian Stable  is last updated 1.5 years ago and a list of CVEs for LO is ridiculously  short.  All this leads to the thought that non-security treatment of DoS issues  is just the tip of the iceberg. Assuming that many security bugs were  fixed in current versions of LO the fact that LO in Debian Stable isn't  updated for a long time probably means that security fixes are not  marked as such and hence are not backported. Please correct me if I'm wrong.  --  Alexander Cherepanov  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
