Use  One might also argue that the underlying problem is that doc/configuration in the Canto distribution tells users to enter link_handler lines with " quoting, e.g.,    link_handler("elinks \"%u\"", text=True)  within the user's ~/.canto/conf.py file. This perhaps could have been addressed either by making the %u value safe before conf.py is executed, or by telling the user to add other Python code to conf.py for correct quoting.  In other words, is a valid vulnerability report because the reporter is using a quoting approach that exactly matches the vendor's recommendation. This is not a site-specific report about an error in one user's ~/.canto/conf.py file.  adds an shlex.quote call -- shlex.quote is found in https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/tip/Lib/shlex.py and has:     return "'" + s.replace("'", "'\"'\"'") + "'"  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =mC0o -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
