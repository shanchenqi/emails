The safe_malloc will therefore be called with  "0" (due to the +1), and then the following memcpy will use the huge len.  (gdb) b mutt_substrdup Breakpoint 1 at file lib.c, line (gdb) c Continuing.  Breakpoint 1, mutt_substrdup (      "From jwilk@...lk.net Wed Nov 26       "From:\n\rI\n") at     { (gdb) c Continuing.  Breakpoint 1, mutt_substrdup "From:\n\rI\n",      ":\n\rI\n") at     { (gdb) c Continuing.  Breakpoint 1, mutt_substrdup "I\n",  "\rI\n") at     { (gdb) x/s begin       "I\n" (gdb) x/s end       "\rI\n" (gdb) n       if (end) (gdb) n         len = end - begin; (gdb) n       p = safe_malloc (len + 1); (gdb) p len $1 = (gdb) p len + 1 $2 = 0  We haven't looked yet where the overlap occurs, nor have a patch yet.  I did have to put "set weed=off" in .muttrc for the issue to present.
