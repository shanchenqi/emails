Directory traversal vulnerability in the WordPress Download Manager plugin for WordPress allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot) in the fname parameter to (1) views/file_download.php or (2) file_download.php.  File file_download.php is not available in any version of WordPress plugin "download-manager" checked SVN and latest version from https://wordpress.org/plugins/download-manager/  PoC refers to random WordPress installation with plugin named "document_manager", which is indeed vulnerable. I sent abuse emails to few affected targets. Plugin "document_manager" is custom and not available in WP plugin repository.  This was noticed during http://www.wpscan.org/ development.  If I am correct OSVDB item refers to issue listed in vexatioustendencies.com, which has different attack scenario and payloads.
