I admit I'm not very good at creating RAW IP-Packets, I tried to start with these example wireshark captures:  I would also be interested in tutorials or other literature (links) which provide information how to create raw IP-Packets in general and how to manipulate their content.  My goals are to better understand these issues and to do some pentesting on my own infrastructure, plus maybe test for some other possible protocol implementation weaknesses in the linux kernel.  I know this is a little of topic, so you can also reply off list, if you wish.  kind regards and thanks in advance.
