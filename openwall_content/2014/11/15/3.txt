However, I believe the fix for first issue to be incorrect (hence helping me misunderstanding the initial issue):  The initial fix adds a string_display_line call to an <input> box. Given that this processes the string for display in html, and there is a string_attribute api call for handling data for display in a text box, I believe that the fix for the other  issue is incorrect and that string_attribute should be used instead of string_display_line (which may do other formatting to the string which may be undesirable when editing configuration values).
