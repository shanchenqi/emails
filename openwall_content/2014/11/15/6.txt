Description:  MantisBT issue attachments can be downloaded without permission.  Due to an incorrect access check, by guessing the download URL  correctly, unprivileged users can download files from a private project  with restricted access to attachments, i.e. where  $g_download_attachments_threshold / $g_view_attachments_threshold are set e.g. to 55 (developer), if another  project to which they have access does not restrict attachments download.  Affected versions: <=  Fixed in versions: (not yet released)  Patch: See Github [1]  Credit: Issue was discovered by Florian Fuchs and fixed by Paul Richards (former  MantisBT developer)  References: Further details available in our issue tracker [2]   D.
