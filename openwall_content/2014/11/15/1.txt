We fixed this issue in Master with the following commit and I believe I requested this to be back-ported at the time. You modified the code not to trigger an error with the commit and to fall back to the default of no value selected.  I don't believe it is correct to state that an issue was discovered in November that we had already discovered, fixed and were planning on backporting to the release in May, and not credit the people who discovered and fixed the original issue.  Paul  -----Original Message----- From: Damien Regad [mailto:dregad@...tisbt.org]  Sent: 14 November To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: [oss-security] CVE Request: XSS vulnerability in MantisBT  Please assign a CVE ID for the following issue.  Description:  The MantisBT Configuration Report page (adm_config_report.php) did not escape a parameter before displaying it on the page, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code.  The severity of this issue is mitigated by the need to have a high-privileged account (by default, administrator) to access the configuration report page.  Affected versions:  >= <=  Fixed in versions: (not yet released)  Patch: See Github [1]  Credit: Issue was discovered by Alejo Popovici and fixed by Damien Regad (MantisBT Developer)  References: Further details available in our issue tracker [2]   D.
