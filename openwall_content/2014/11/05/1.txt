The data for most things that you  describe seems to be available from valgrind so it could be scripted.  >> Simple fuzzing of objdump with zzuf (not even afl) quickly gives out tens >> and hundreds of different cases of mentioned errors (mostly from the first >> group:-). Now what? > > Well, deduping is important.  That's after deduping by a call stack as available in valgrind output:-( That is, for those thousands of samples which were run through it.  Unfortunately valgrind is not very fast and millions of other crashes  were not analyzed.  Well, after the first bunch of crashes will be fixed I can simply rerun  zzuf and see which crashes are left.  > If you're running without ASLR, you can > get reasonably good results by grouping problems by %eip / %rip where > the crash occurred. Looking at the call stack is good, too.  Indeed. And both things are easy to get with gdb. And it's much faster  than valgrind.  > But some > memory corruption issues will have latent effects. With these, ASAN / > Valgrind / debugging allocator can help.  Indeed.
