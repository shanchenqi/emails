Are these two formulations > equivalent?  HMAC fits in the unknown-prefix category when used correctly.  Not sure about general proofs, but the current collision attacks on MD5 won't work without knowing the IHV ahead of time, and if you know the HMAC key you don't need collisions.  >> In the case of an unknown-prefix, HMAC[1] or anything requiring a >> preimage, it's >> just hardening to use swap out MD5 (and SHA-1). >> >> [1] Unless you accidentally swap the key and data fields!  And to elaborate - if you swap the key and data fields, you can use a normal md5 collision, then XOR against opad.
