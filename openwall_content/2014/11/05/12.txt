Surely there are uses of both MD5 and DES where the choice of these primitives is not a vulnerability.  For example, md5crypt is not affected by MD5 collisions.  (It's EOL'ed by the author for other reasons, though.)  Similarly, the use of DES in BSDI/FreeSec extended crypt() is not a vulnerability (it's 64-bit hash space is a bit too small, etc., but that's another matter).  And 3DES is still OK.  For yet another example, while HMAC-MD5 shouldn't be used for new designs, there's no known realistic attack on it yet:  New Proofs for NMAC and HMAC - Cryptology ePrint Archive  New Proofs for NMAC and HMAC: Security without Collision-Resistance http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/papers/hmac-new.html    "  Therefore, it may not be urgent to remove HMAC-MD5 from the existing    protocols.  However, since MD5 must not be used for digital    signatures, for a new protocol design, a ciphersuite with HMAC-MD5    should not be included."  Curious comments by Thomas Pornin and Dmitry Khovratovich on whether e.g. MD5's compression function may be a PRF or not (and thus whether the HMAC proof fully applies or not) despite of its insufficient collision resistance:   Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
