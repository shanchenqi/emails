This is a serious bug (it certainly circumvents the security of OpenSSH), but I think the proposed fix doesn't fit.  What might be a better solution is to store the public key for all devices, and accept if it matches any device you've talked to before.  On discovering a new device, it shows the fingerprint and prompts for a name/description.  Then you can revoke devices in some other part of the UI when you need to clean up.
