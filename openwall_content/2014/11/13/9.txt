(Note that > systemd-resolved is more than a minimal stub because it has a cache.)  I have to agree with Florian here.  It's possible that was the wrong citation, since it seems to be devoted mainly to making sure that you don't accept packets from remote DNS servers you didn't request them from.  the problem with systemd-resolved as i understand it not that it's accepting packets from DNS servers it didn't request from, but that it's caching unrelated responses in those records.  This isn't typically an issue for cache-less stub resolvers, because they're being invoked by things like gethostbyname(), which might receive the extra information but won't actually process it, cache it, or do anything with it.  It sounds like a vulnerability to me, and i hope that MITRE will reconsider its decision here.  	--dkg   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
