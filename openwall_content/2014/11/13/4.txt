I asked Bert to be sure, and he says that it was his intent that the  advice applied to non-recursive resolvers as well.  (Note that  systemd-resolved is more than a minimal stub because it has a cache.)  > Is your message attempting to assert that EVERY implementation of a > stub resolver must satisfy RFC requirements, in order to account > for the possibility that the configured recursive name servers have > security problems, and the possibility that an attacker can > communicate directly with the stub resolver?  The DNS specification does not require rewriting of upstream responses  to filter out parts for which the queried server is not authoritative.  This means that a downstream caching resolver will tend to poison its  cache if it adds data from such responses that are not directly in  response to the QNAME.  I believe this is still a real-world issue (in  the sense that this is triggered accidentally, not through attacks).   --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
