But your message was a reminder that someone somewhere should be thinking hard about how to replace the "our systems we have today".

There are a few interesting  No not going to happen soon, but starting now would be better than waiting. I guess that's my point.

I feel fuzzing can improve the > state of things a lot.  I agree completely and I know you're right.  Sometimes my fuzzing, some might call it PEBKAC, turns up a thing or two.
