This is currently exploited in the wild.  Plugin has later changed name to Creative Contact Form: https://wordpress.org/plugins/sexy-contact-form/  Affected: - - Joomla component com_sexycontactform and below in   "components/com_sexycontactform/fileupload/UploadHandler.php". Version   contains fix. - - WordPress plugin "includes/fileupload/UploadHandler.php" /   and below. Changelog says that version contains the fix.  Fix is empty file so possibly removing the feature completely. There is also a proprietary version of this plugin available, but the codebase is nearly the same as far as I can tell.  UploadHandler.php is "jQuery File Upload Plugin PHP Class in both plugins. I have submitted all malicious uploaded files to several AV vendors. - From log files I'm able to tell that these are automated attacks. Attacker tried to exploit several Linux local exploit, sent emails and executed DoS attacks. I have also reported affected installations via email to abuse@ addresses and CERT.  I can investigate more if you have questions.  - --- Henri Salo -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =sUX3 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
