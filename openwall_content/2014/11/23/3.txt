First of all let me remind that I recently found an out of bounds access in less's unicode decoding itself. Upstream is not responsing atm. It's only a read error, but it was not even fuzzing, it was an accidental finding, I'd expect that further analysis might yield to more.   Now lesspipe: I didn't know that this thing exists until very recently but I was aware that less did some kind of parsing and e.g. I quite liked the idea that you can "less" gz/bzip2 files.  Actually leaving security asside I quite like the idea of lesspipe, so I'm reluctant to say "lesspipe scripts have gotta die / be disabled".  That said the alternative is a tough one. It would be something like this: * Fuzz all the things in lesspipe * Report what you find * Kill the tools that have unsatisfying upstream reactions and replace   them with more secure ones. And even after doing this this probably wouldn't count as a high security solution.  I'm aware this feels like a huge effort, but actually it fits very well in the project I'm about to start anyway. And lesspipe gives a good starting point to what tools might deserve some more fuzzing.  cu, --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
