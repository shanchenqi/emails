The libFLAC project, an open source library implementing reference encoders and decoders for native FLAC and Ogg FLAC audio content, suffers from multiple implementation issues.  In particular, a stack overflow and a heap overflow condition, which may result in arbitrary code execution, can be triggered by passing a maliciously crafted .flac file to the libFLAC decoder.
