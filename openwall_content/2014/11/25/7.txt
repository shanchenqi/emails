The upstream advisory mention following impact:  > Impact of the security bug > ========================== >  > By using special crafted S/MIME messages or ECC based OpenPGP data, it > is possible to create a buffer overflow.  The bug is not easy to exploit > because there only 80 possible values which can be used to overwrite > memory.  However, a denial of service is possible and someone may come > up with other clever attacks.  Thus this should be fix. >  > Affected versions: All Libksba versions < >  > Background: Yesterday Hanno Bรถck found an invalid memory access in the > 2.1 branch of GnuPG by conveying a malformed OID as part of an ECC key. > It turned out that this bug has also been in libksba ever since and > affects at least gpgsm and dirmngr.  The code to convert an OID to its > string representation has an obvious error of not considering an invalid > encoding for arc-2.  A first byte of can be used to make a value of > less then 80 and we then subtract 80 from it as required by the OID > encoding rules.  Due to the use of an unsigned integer this results in a > pretty long value which won't fit anymore into the allocated buffer. > The actual fix for lib Libksba is commit  Announce: Upstream fix:  Can a CVE be assigned for this issue in libksba (if not already requested).
