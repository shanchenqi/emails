Affected versions 4.0,   * Denial of service for giant passwords. This is the same issue as in Drupal, and was reported by the same individuals to both projects. The phpass library by Solar Designer was used in both projects without setting a maximum password length, which can lead to CPU exhaustion upon hashing.

Affected versions <= 4.0 (except >= / / Reported by Ben Bidner.   *  Previously an email address change would not invalidate a previous password reset email.
