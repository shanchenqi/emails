[Cc-ing Binutils ML back again]  Yeah, I think there was even an article in one of recent PLDIs which  discussed different approaches to filtering duplicates arising in  compiler fuzz testing (they did various combinations of stacktraces,  Valgrind output, program coverage, etc.).  I was just curious how well  this works for real world tasks like objdump crashes.  -Y  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
