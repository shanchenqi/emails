It creates a hash among the code path and groups fuzzing samples by that. That's quite convenient.  I am currently playing a lot with this. afl is in a somewhat experimental state and you'll run into more problems trying to get it running, but if it runs it is much more convenient than zzuf. Disadvantage is you need to recompile stuff to work with it and that sometimes fails, esp. when assembler is involved.  --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
