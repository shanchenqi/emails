Description:  The XML Import/Export "official" plugin (i.e. bundled with MantisBT  releases) currently does not perform any access level checks in the  import and export pages. This leads to the following vulnerabilities:  1) import  Any user of a MantisBT instance with the XML plugin enabled and knowing  the URL to the plugin's import page could upload an XML file and insert  data without restriction, regardless of their access level.  This vulnerability is particularly dangerous when used in combination  with the one described in issue [1] as it makes  for a very simple and easily accessible vector for PHP code injection  attacks.  2) export  There was also no access check when exporting data, which could allow an  attacker to gain access to confidential information (disclosure of all  bug-related data, including usernames).  Systems where the patch described below cannot be applied are strongly  advised to uninstall the plugin.
