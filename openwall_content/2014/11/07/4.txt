The build recipes in Debian packaging are all-powerful; they run arbitrary commands and executables with full privileges of the user building the package.  The maintainer scripts in Debian binary packages are all-powerful; they run arbitrary commands and executables with root privileges when packages are installed.  There is no need to resort to format string vulnerabilities in control files to execute malicious code in an untrusted package. It would be easier and more reliable to simply put malicious code directly in the debian/rules file or postinst scripts.  It is not safe to build packages from untrusted sources. It is not safe to install packages from untrusted sources.  This is why we did not assign a CVE from Ubuntu's CVE pool.
