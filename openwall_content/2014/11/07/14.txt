I was just curious how well > this works for real world tasks like objdump crashes.  You can see for yourself. My recent (since UTC)  attachments in the mentioned PRs are tarballs containing a file list.txt  which lists various errors from valgrind (with distinct backtraces) and  one sample hitting it for every error.  Later I started to include short statistics in a comment. My last  attachment to PR lists the following errors for `objdump -x`:  Files: 11 Errors:        1 Argument 'size' of function malloc has a fishy (possibly  negative) value: ...       63 Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)       16 Invalid read of size ...        2 Invalid write of size ...        1 Syscall param write(buf) contains uninitialised byte(s)       17 Use of uninitialised value of size ...  oss-security, please note invalid writes and fishy arguments for malloc.  Back to real world deduping. IMHO it's not ideal but works quite well,  e.g. you can get 10 files out of thousands. If you have hundreds of  thousands or millions of crashers (which was trivial with objdump in the  beginning) valgrind is too slow. Replacing it with gdb improve the  situation (we loose full analysis but get the stacktrace for the crash  faster).  --  Alexander Cherepanov  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
