This message provides details on the issue, including resolution. Kindly  update the CVE database accordingly.  Description:  When importing data with the plugin, user input passed through the  "description" field (and the "issuelink" attribute) of the uploaded XML  file isn't properly sanitized before being used in a call to the  preg_replace() function which uses the 'e' modifier. This can be  exploited to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code when the  Import/Export plugin is installed.  The XML Import/Export "official" plugin comes bundled with MantisBT  releases.   Affected versions: >= <=  Fixed in versions: (not yet released)  Patch: See Github [4]  This fix is a backport of an existing commit [1] from master branch,  which has been confirmed as addressing the issue.  Credit: Issue was discovered by Egidio Romano (http://karmainsecurity.com/) Original fix (master branch) by Dominik Blunk Backporting fix to 1.2.x branch by Damien Regad (MantisBT Developer)  References: Further details available in our issue tracker [2] See also related issue/vulnerability [3]   [1] [2] [3] [4]   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
