A side issue is that by itself, only modified the demos/autocomplete/combobox.html file. We realize that the demos are shipped in the jquery-ui distribution. However, the demos typically wouldn't be part of the deployed product, so there's a question of whether combobox.html could have its own CVEs. In this case, the question seems largely irrelevant because changing the combobox.html code wasn't a useful way to address a vulnerability.
