I named since it pretty much enumerates best DNS security practises of the last 20 years. systemd never states to implement and so everyone can sleep well and hide behind the word 'stub'.  But in fact systemd's aim is to replace core system components like the system-resolver. What other reason could exist, that the proper nsswitch modules are provided as well or that the project itself exists at all?  So replacing core DNS components of Linux in mass setups shows up on the horizon; at least it is attempted. Thats enough reason for us to look at the code.  Even when I agree that DNSSEC should be used to address all the shortcomings, its not acceptable to throw away last 20 years of DNS security evolution en passant.   > > the problem with systemd-resolved as i understand it not that it's > accepting packets from DNS servers it didn't request from, but that it's > caching unrelated responses in those records.  Exactly. Now one can argue that an upstream DNS will filter such (well formed) garbage. But how many desktop users set up their own filtering bind9 on or on a dedicated host (properly shielded by ingress filtering, otherwise its useless)? I bet _a lot_ will just use or its v6 alternative, also because systemd-resolved comes with these DNS servers pre-configured (!).  How easy do we want to make it to the agency to twist the MX records on SMTP servers??  I'd be happy with no CVE being assigned. At the end I just want to have the cache hardened.
