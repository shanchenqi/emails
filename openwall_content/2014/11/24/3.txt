I don't know if the project is dead? On this[1] site it claims: "KeePassX is no longer maintained." However version 2.0 is still alpha, so maybe the safest way for a local open source password manager is to use the original keepass from https://www.keepass.info/  I'll report some private fuzzing results, hopefully later this week.
