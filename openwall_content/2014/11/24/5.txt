This release also includes several bugfixes, including changes to the insecure-registry option. Below are CVE descriptions for the vulnerabilities addressed in this release.  Docker is available immediately for all supported platforms: https://docs.docker.com/installation/   Docker Security Advisory [24 Nov =================================================================  ===================================================== Archive extraction allowing host privilege escalation ===================================================== Severity: Critical Affects: Docker up to  The Docker engine, up to and including version was vulnerable to extracting files to arbitrary paths on the host during ‘docker pull’ and ‘docker load’ operations. This was caused by symlink and hardlink traversals present in Docker's image extraction. This vulnerability could be leveraged to perform remote code execution and privilege escalation.  Docker remedies this vulnerability. Additional checks have been added to pkg/archive and image extraction is now performed in a chroot. No remediation is available for older versions of Docker and users are advised to upgrade.  Related vulnerabilities discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security and independent researcher, Tõnis Tiigi.  ================================================================= Security options applied to image could lead to container escalation ================================================================= Severity: Critical Affects: Docker  Docker versions through allowed security options to be applied to images, allowing images to modify the default run profile of containers executing these images. This vulnerability could allow a malicious image creator to loosen the restrictions applied to a container’s processes, potentially facilitating a break-out.  Docker remedies this vulnerability. Security options applied to images are no longer consumed by the Docker engine and will be ignored. Users are advised to upgrade.  ================================================================= Other changes: =================================================================  Besides the above CVEs, the release allows administrators to pass a CIDR-formatted range of addresses for '—insecure-registry'. In addition, allowing a cleartext registry to exist on localhost is now default behavior. This change was made due to user feedback following the changes made in to resolve   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
