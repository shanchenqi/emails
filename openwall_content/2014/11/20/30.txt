I would argue that "is also valuable" is underplaying it a little ;) IMO having the input (and information on how was it loaded in some cases) is much more valuable than having anything else (be it stack traces or whatever) as it allows devs to actually look at the crashing app in using any tool they like to use (be it gdb, valgrind, windbg, or what not), which speeds things up.  If it came from a mutation-based fuzzer, the original (not-mutated) sample can be useful too.  In most* cases the above is enough for the devs to reproduce the problem even without a detailed report. * - in case of weird environment/context setting sometimes a report is a must  So, personally I would phrase it like this "crashing sample is a must; everything else is good to have".  ym2c :) -- Gynvael Coldwind   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
