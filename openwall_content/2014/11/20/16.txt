I wanted to lay out my rough plans / brainstorming and welcome any feedback and especially if people have worries about such a project.  * The core of the project will be a list of free software projects that   in one way or another parse fileformats (I'll leave fuzzing network   and other input out for now). It should have rough categories (ok =   fuzzed and no unfixed issues in latest release, wip: fuzzed and issues   are being worked on or already fixed in source repo, stale: fuzzed and   issues don't seem to be worked on, unavalable = project with no   developers to contact, wontfix = developers don't feel memory access   issues and crashes need to be fixed / declare their product   unsuitable for untrusted input, unknown = no known fuzzing efforts)   I feel that it's important to make the limitation of this info   transparent (e.g. about to change rapidly, always further /different   fuzzing strategies that might turn up more issues, fuzzing is not a   good indicator for overall security etc.). * A sharing place for stuff that might be useful for fuzzing, I think   especially about patches that disable sanity checks (CRCs etc.) that   make fuzzing harder. And maybe file collections with small example   files for various file formats. * Some introduction tutorials that should give people with no fuzzing   experience a starter. Preferrably so easy that everyone with some   basic linux/unix knowledge can follow them. Explain zzuf, asan, afl. * All kinds of pointers/links to further information.  Data and things like file archive should preferrably be public domain / cc0 to make data sharing as easy as possible.  I welcome your feedback. I also welcome all reports (preferrably with links to public sources where this is documented - bugtrackers, mailing list archives etc.) of fuzzing. The good ("I fuzzed this for so long and it seems just nothing turned up") and the bad ("I found unique crashers and reported them all upstream, nobody cares").  cu, --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
