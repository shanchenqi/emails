IMPACT ======  Malicious or buggy stub domain kernels or tool stacks otherwise living outside of Domain0 can mount a denial of service attack which, if successful, can affect the whole system.  Only domains controlling HVM guests can exploit this vulnerability. (This includes domains providing hardware emulation services to HVM guests.)  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen versions from at least 3.2.x onwards are vulnerable on x86 systems. Older versions have not been inspected.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.  This vulnerability is only applicable to Xen systems using stub domains or other forms of disaggregation of control domains for HVM guests.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only PV guests will avoid this issue.  (The security of a Xen system using stub domains is still better than with a qemu-dm running as an unrestricted dom0 process.  Therefore users with these configurations should not switch to an unrestricted dom0 qemu-dm.)  NOTE REGARDING LACK OF EMBARGO ==============================  A draft of this advisory was mistakenly sent to xen-devel.  The Xen Project Security Team apologises for this error.  We are working to share best working practices amongst the team to reduce the risks of recurrance.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Andrew Cooper of Citrix.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.         xen-unstable, Xen 4.4.x, Xen 4.3.x, Xen 4.2.x  $  $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =LDjw -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
