Compared to "starting from scratch" starting such a fuzzing project is not herculean, it's more like grabbing the low hanging fruit.  But arguments alike come up every now and then. Basically you'll hear two things: "We have to mitigate / sandbox" and "please rewrite everything in [insert favorite non-C programming language]".  I don't want to downplay either of these approaches. It's just that you have to be realistic. Nobody will rewrite everything from scratch in rust/go/haskell/whatever any time soon. There are a few interesting projects that try to rewrite key sofware in safer languages (mitls and servo come to mind), but they are few and none of them is in a production state.  Our systems we have today - the ones we use to have this discussion, manage our bank accounts and surf the web - have imperfect software written mostly in unsafe languages. I feel fuzzing can improve the state of things a lot.   --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
