Well, the answer to that is: the people who do the fuzzing.  My main aim is to make more transparent what's already going on. That's not going to change who does the fuzzing and how it gets reported.  There lays deeper a question that I asked myself already: What's an "okay" way of reporting these things? Basically what I usually did is just sending crash samples to upstream devs and add some valgrind/asan output. One could argue that I'm offloading the real work to the upstream devs, however I feel they know their code better than I do (and often I'm just not qualified to create the fix). Until now I feel most upstreams were okay with that.   --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
