If so this will ease tracking the two issues. For reference they are:  > Session hijacking (Drupal 6 and 7) >  > A specially crafted request can give a user access to another user's > session, allowing an attacker to hijack a random session. >  > This attack is known to be possible on certain Drupal 7 sites which > serve both HTTP and HTTPS content ("mixed-mode"), but it is possible > there are other attack vectors for both Drupal 6 and Drupal 7. > > Denial of service (Drupal 7 only) >  > Drupal 7 includes a password hashing API to ensure that user > supplied passwords are not stored in plain text. >  > A vulnerability in this API allows an attacker to send specially > crafted requests resulting in CPU and memory exhaustion. This may > lead to the site becoming unavailable or unresponsive (denial of > service). >  > This vulnerability can be exploited by anonymous users.  They are fixed in Drupal7 and Drupal6   [1]   Regards,  Salvatore  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
