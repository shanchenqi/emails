This is a critical security release for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.  Can I get CVEs for vulnerabilities fixed in this release, thank you. I am not sure if some or any of these has been requested already.  - --- Henri Salo -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =LQyo -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
