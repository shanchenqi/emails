I see it pretty much as a given condition that you give the copy of the crashing input to the upstream devs. I can hardly think of a reason not to do so (the only thing that comes to mind are confidential or copyrighted files, I try to make sure I always start fuzzing with inputs that are freely licensed or created by myself to avoid that).  --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
