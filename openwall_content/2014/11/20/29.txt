From a naive perspective. I don't mean to diminish your idea/contribution. I like the ideas you've put forth but I'm not qualified to address them technically. But what I read from this is a real need to start something completely new from the ground up. In other words replace the system that's in place. Starting from scratch. Perhaps it's already being worked on but is only a seed. Like Linus' work as a student those years ago.  Maybe my problem is that your proposal seems herculean to me but can't help to think it's a reminder or sign that we need to think past the current state of things.  I look forward to the section on how to "get fuzzing for beginners" and best of luck to you all on this idea/project.
