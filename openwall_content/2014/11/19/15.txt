Security audits depend greatly on the configuration and use of the machine. Having a generic security audit is practically useless.  A company would usually pay to have a security audit produced (either via internal or external auditors) and contains very specific details about their particular installation. These audits are regarded as sensitive and proprietary information and not publically distributed.  Nobody has an incentive to produce generic security audits of out of the box OS distributions and then make them publically available.
