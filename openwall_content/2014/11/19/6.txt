So you'd think based on what people use clamav for it would have been heavily fuzzed by now (scanning all sorts of random/malicious input) but I guess people don't report stuff upstream.  Perhaps if we could get people to report crashes in stuff like this more reliably that would be a good start "your program crashed when I processed this file, here's a copy of the file, thanks" (assuming the file doesn't contain sensitive info of course).  --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
