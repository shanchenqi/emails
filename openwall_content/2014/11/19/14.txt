I must be  I am not Vietnamese but I have spent a lot of time in Vietnam and occasionally do business there.  No, there are no non-western OS in use there. It is pretty much all pirated Windows. The hacker culture there is very small, nearly non-existent, although the Saigon Linux User Group are very bright and capable albeit only maybe 4 regulars:  https://saigonlug.org/  I am not aware of any non-western operating systems in use anywhere in the world.
