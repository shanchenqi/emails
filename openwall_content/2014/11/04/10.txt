Consider an archive created with the following command:  $ printf '//' 8 '/0' 0 >  test.a  then runnig strip/objcopy on it will unlink ./file (e.g.  ).  Consider this:  $ printf '//' 12  '/0' 0 > test.a  then runnig strip/objcopy on it will unlink ../../file (e.g.  unlink("staOxyFW/../../st4KIqLm/../../file") ).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Could CVEs please be assigned to these issues?  --  Alexander Cherepanov  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
