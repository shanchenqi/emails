I need a CVE number.  I understand you are an authority that can provide this.  Let me know if I can help provide anything else.   KDE Project Security Advisory =============================  Title:          kde-workspace: Risk Rating:    Medium (??) CVE: ??? Platforms:      All Versions:       kde-workspace < Author:         David Edmundson <davidedmundson@....org> Date:           4 November  Overview ========  KDE workspace configuration module for setting the date and time has a helper program which runs as root for performing actions. This is secured with polkit.  This helper takes the name of the ntp utility to run as an argument. This allows a hacker to run any arbitrary command as root under the guise of updating the time.  Impact ======  An application can gain root priveledges from an admin user with either misleading information or no interaction.  On some systems the user will be shown a prompt to change the time. However, if the system has policykit-desktop-privileges installed, the datetime helper will be invoked by an admin user without any prompts.   Workaround ==========  Add a polkit rule to disable the org.kde.kcontrol.kcmclock.save action  Solution ========  Upgrade kde-desktop to once released or apply the following patch:   Credits =======  Thanks to David Edmundson for finding and fixing the issue   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
