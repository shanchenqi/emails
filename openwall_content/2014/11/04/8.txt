This doesn't seem to cross privilege boundaries; there's no way for untrusted users to specify the supplementary groups.  Incidentally, when there's a statement such as "I am not familiar enough to know whether any privilege boundaries are crossed here, or if a user can influence anything" in a CVE request message, it's probably useful to be even more explicit about what parts of the message that statement applies to.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =T37i -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
