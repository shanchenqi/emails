You're preaching to the choir; I highly value the good work they do. And I am sensitive to the fact that assignments are sometimes made with imperfect/incomplete information with time and other resource constraints limiting the amount of analysis that can go into any given report.    > If you care about CVEs being assigned only for meaningful security > issues, it's good to research practical exploitability first, or help > them evaluate other public reports if they seem unclear. If you don't > care about it... well, that's a perfectly valid stance :-)  I used Alexander's post as a springboard for a follow-up question. The case of libbfd, because of the variation in the issues, can be illuminating as to CVE allocation - broadly speaking.  But, my take differs from Alexander's. He seemed to be questioning the justification of some of the libbfd CVE assignments. My preference, on the other hand, is a more liberal approach to allocation when dealing with libraries. My earlier email explains why.  Your reply made me worry my email came across as some kind of rebuke. So let me go on record by saying that though not taxonomic by design, the CVE project is an extremely valuable vulnerability tracking tool and MITRE should be commended for their leadership in this area.    > There's a bit of weirdness around assigning CVEs to groups of issues > ("multiple crashes with evidence of memory corruption"), not assigning > them to proactive security improvements (e.g., the Shellshock thing); > but ultimately, they are just a tool (mostly for looking up original > patches and advisories later in the game), and most of the situations > where they are relied on for something more (e.g., comparing the > security of competing software) are misguided. >  > On Mon, Nov 3, at PM, mancha <mancha1@...o.com> wrote: > > On Mon, Nov 03, at Alexander Cherepanov > > wrote: > >> On cve-assign@...re.org wrote: > >> > >> Thanks for assigning CVEs for these issues but I have a couple of > >> questions regarding CVE-worthiness of various things.
