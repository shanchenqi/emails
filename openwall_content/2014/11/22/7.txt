"sudo service tomcat6 restart" would be a pretty obvious example that I suspect is not uncommon in server environments.  In general, Java is a general-purpose programming language, so I think there are plenty of examples of this just like there are with any other programming language.  Any large system written in Java probably has a few Java command-line tools or ways to spawn Java daemons, and in the normal course of setting up a system, it's likely that someone is granting access to run those tools via sudo.  --  Russ Allbery (eagle@...ie.org)              <http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/>  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
