Oh, AFL itself looks pretty blindingly easy to use: CC=... CXX=...  and go with it. It's our packaging and building infrastracture that I think would make it more complicated: they're designed to make repeatable builds easy, not necessarily to allow arbitrary changes to the compiler.

That does sound nice, not every Bad Thing is necessarily visible to the fuzzer, but asan is more likely to recognize Bad Things.  > I agree that it's not the best proxy for code quality.

Oh my yes; having a contact readily visible, having someone respond quickly, both are very strong indicators of quality.
