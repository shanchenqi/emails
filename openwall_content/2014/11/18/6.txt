I had something alike this already in mind. I thought about some "mapping" of open source tools parsing fileformats.  They would roughly fall into four categories: 1. ok extensive fuzzing has been done and all known memory corruption issues are fixed (this would probably apply to well-proven libs like zlib, libpng etc.) 2. work in progress fuzzing has revealed issues but the devs are actively working on fixing them in a timely manner (binutils/libbfd would fall into this category) 3. unfixed Known memory corruption issues exist and there is no upstream developer available fixing them (abandoned software) or the upstream developer is not willing to fix issues / thinks the tool is not suitable for untrusted input. 4. unknown No extensive fuzzing done.  I will probably come up with some project like this.  --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
