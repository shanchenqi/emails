Even certification by NIAP doesn't guarantee that it's bug free.  Nor that it's secure.  But it does make it relatively more likely to have fewer bugs and be more secure.  Same with OSS tool fuzzing and some kind of database indicating the level of fuzzing that has happened on them.  If I were a Linux distro maintainer, looking at packages to include, I would appreciate this information.  (For that matter, I'd appreciate it for my own use, though that's less relevant.)  If there is a distro maintainer on this list, please chime in.   ________________________________________ From: Ĺšmicier Januszkiewicz [gauri@....by] Sent: Tuesday, November 18, AM To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: [security-vendor] Re: [oss-security] Fuzzing findings (and maybe CVE requests) - Image/GraphicsMagick, elfutils, GIMP, gdk-pixbuf, file, ndisasm, less  Robert Watson <robertcwatson1@...il.com>:  > What about using fuzzing to find those tools withOUT vulnerabilities and > "certifying them" in some way as safe for all inputs?  I think the main issue with this approach would be that one cannot prove that something DOES NOT exist. One can easily prove that something DOES exist by producing evidence: you can prove a bug exists by providing reproduction steps or a proof-of-concept file that triggers the issue. On the other hand, it would be very problematic to prove a program is bug-free -- what evidence can you bring to support that? Since one can theoretically produce an infinite amount of test cases given e.g. a grammar, how would you test a program against "all inputs"? If it's via fuzzing, who can "certify" that a fuzzer you used indeed produced "all inputs"? Would we need fuzzer certifications, then?  I think every time after a product passes an audit, a certification, or whatever, another guy comes about and spots a security issue nobody else has spotted before. Is the product still secure? Does that kind of certification actually mean anything with respect to "having no bugs"? I strongly doubt that.  Cheers, Z.
