ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The emulation of far branch instructions (CALL, JMP, and RETF in Intel assembly syntax, LCALL, LJMP, and LRET in AT&T assembly syntax) incompletely performs privilege checks.  However these instructions are not usually handled by the emulator. Exceptions to this are - - when a memory operand lives in (emulated or passed through) memory   mapped IO space, - - in the case of guests running in 32-bit PAE mode, when such an   instruction is (in execution flow) within four instructions of one   doing a page table update, - - when an Invalid Opcode exception gets raised by a guest instruction,   and the guest then (likely maliciously) alters the instruction to   become one of the affected ones, - - when the guest is in real mode (in which case there are no privilege   checks anyway).  IMPACT ======  Malicious HVM guest user mode code may be able to elevate its privileges to guest supervisor mode, or to crash the guest.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen and onward are vulnerable on x86 systems.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.  Only user processes in x86 HVM guests can take advantage of this vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only PV guests will avoid this issue.  There is no mitigation available for HVM guests.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.         xen-unstable, Xen 4.4.x     Xen 4.3.x, Xen 4.2.x  $   $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =u7Zi -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
