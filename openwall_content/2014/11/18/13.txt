You may overestimate the complexity of afl. Once you get used to it it basically takes minutes to start a fuzzing job. And Michal is very open to suggestions to improve it (and it is improving on a daily basis right now).  A bit sad is that afl+asan is somewhat tricky business, because that'd be the ultimate combo.  > The results of a fuzzing project would not greatly influence our > decision to support a package.

I agree that it's not the best proxy for code quality. But for me what is a good proxy for *project* quality is how they handle the bugs that result from fuzzing. While libbfd was in a terrible state, Nick did a marvellous job in fixing everythin we reported in a timely manner. Whilst for others you simply don't get a reply (or there is noone to report to).  That's the difference between a healthy and an unhealthy project.   --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
