I have a few reproducer zips but I have not looked further at exploiting this. Fortify catches this crash on both Red Hat and Ubuntu.  Although this is in the same area (compression) as the "unzip -t" thread I don't think they are directly related: mancha's patch doesn't solve this problem and "unzip -l unzip_t_malloc.zip" doesn't crash.  I'll drop a line to the InfoZip guys via their web interface so that they see these two conversations.
