I would also find it instructive if MITRE shed light on its CVE assignation heuristics for libbsd. Response to libbfd issues can be particularly enlightening because the issues vary largely in scope & type.  In the past, I've noticed a liberal approach to CVE allocation when dealing with libraries due to what you said: it is often difficult to assess the security impact of flaws because they ultimately depend on the context of applications using the library. As case in point, the NULL pointer dereference crasher (zero-size S-record) DoS'es manchabfd (small network daemon I just wrote). That flaw didn't receive a CVE.  --mancha  unedited post:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
