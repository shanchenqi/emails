Use for this issue in which a plain HTTP session is used, and a man-in-the-middle attack can lead to remote code execution (or retrieving sensitive configuration information).   > When this option is enabled - and it is enabled by default(!) - > various information ... are submitted to Percona along with the > server's IP address ... without bringing it to user's attention or > asking for their consent.  There is no CVE assignment specifically for the transmission of data to Percona without user confirmation. This is potentially unwanted behavior, but it does not seem that this a mistake (in the sense that a developer was trying to implement a different behavior).  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =s5z5 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
