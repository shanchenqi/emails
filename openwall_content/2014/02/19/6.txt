Incremental patches to also address 32-bit ones are now being provided in addition.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  AMD CPU erratum "Specific Combination of Writes to Write Combined Memory Types and Locked Instructions May Cause Core Hang" describes a situation under which a CPU core may hang.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest administrator can mount a denial of service attack affecting the whole system.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  The vulnerability is applicable only to family 16h model AMD CPUs.  Such CPUs running Xen versions 3.3 onwards are vulnerable.  We have not checked earlier versions of Xen.  HVM guests can always exploit the vulnerability if it is present. PV guests can exploit the vulnerability only if they have been granted access to physical device(s).  Non-AMD CPUs are not vulnerable.  CREDITS =======  This issue's security impact was discovered by Jan Beulich.  MITIGATION ==========  This issue can be avoided by neither running HVM guests, nor assigning PCI devices to PV guests.  RESOLUTION ==========  The attached xsa82.patch contains a software workaround which resolves this issue for 64-bit hypervisors. To also resolve the issue on 32-bit hypervisors (Xen 4.2.x and 4.1.x only), the respective attached needs to be applied on top.  Alternatively, the recommended workaround can be implemented in firmware, so a suitable firmware update will resolve the issue. If you require a firmware update please consult your vendor.  xsa82.patch             Xen 4.1.x, Xen 4.2.x, Xen 4.3.x, xen-unstable   Xen 4.1.x   Xen 4.2.x  $ xsa82*.patch    xsa82.patch $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =ie9o -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment "xsa82.patch" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
