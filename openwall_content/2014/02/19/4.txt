If eliminating the unsafe unserialize use would not completely address those issues, additional CVE IDs may be needed.  There are no new CVE assignments yet for possible other issues in the changelog entry, such as:    CalDAV/Calendar: fixed permanent auth request in iCal, if   accountselection is set to "selectbox with groupmembers" and rights   granted from group without being a member    SiteMgr: fixed not working anonymous user and using now a random   password  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =usF1 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
