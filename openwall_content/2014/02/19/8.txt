As far as we can tell, the code was attempting to implement and use djb33, and did actually implement and use djb33 without a "software mistake" in the traditional sense. Yes, we realize that there's a potentially important and potentially simple attack possibility that could have been avoided by not choosing djb33. That's not sufficient, however. Also, in this case, some aspects of making a better choice (e.g., with sufficiently fast and auditable pseudorandom hashing code) were probably not even understood in the research community at the time the software was originally written.  CVE does, as a secondary form of inclusion, cover vulnerability advisories from a vendor who was the original author of a piece of software and publishes a change as a required security update. That is unlikely here; nobody is anticipating  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =cfE8 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
