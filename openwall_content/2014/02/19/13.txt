Option 2 has now been chosen.  The clarified meaning of is now the vulnerability in older ImageMagick versions (such as that use the "L%02ld" string. The root cause here is that the code did not cover the case of more than 99 layers, which is apparently allowable but relatively uncommon. This has a resultant buffer overflow, e.g, is safe but is unsafe. When the overflow occurs, it can be described as "1 or more bytes too many."  A new ID of is now assigned for the vulnerability in newer ImageMagick versions that use the "L%06ld" string. The root cause here is that the code did not recognize the relationship between the 8 (or more) characters in "L%06ld" and the actual buffer size. This has a resultant buffer overflow of "4 or more bytes too many."  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJTBUBdAAoJEKllVAevmvms6DMIAKIPMAVIsUycaTjAgTdFoUmj =WQsh -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
