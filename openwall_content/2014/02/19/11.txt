Looks like it requires a CVE.  Copying-and-pasting from our bug [5]:   It was reported [1],[2] that the CGI::Application perl module suffered from a flaw where, in certain cases, it would unexpectedly dump a complete set of web query data and server environment information as an error page.  This could allow unintended disclosure of sensitive information.  A suggested fix is available [3] and the commit that caused the problem [4] was most likely introduced in version   [1] [2] [3] https://github.com/markstos/CGI--Application/pull/15 [4] [5]   Thanks.  --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
