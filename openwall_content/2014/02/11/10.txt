We recently published a blog post about the state of ASLR/PIE on Linux compared to how it is on Windows:  tl;dr: On x86 Linux, there's a significant performance impact to PIE, however on the platform it's not so clear whether the performance impact is significant enough to stop widespread use of PIE.  This is where we are looking for input from the Linux vendors.  It has been reported 2.4 PIE and x64 <snip>   ... "A quick evaluation for x64 reports an average overhead of and a geometric mean of for an -O3 optimization level on the same system using the "test" dataset of SPEC  For those environments that put a high value on security, it would seem that a 2-3% overhead might be acceptable.  Though being a compile-time option, it would seem that the "faster" vs. "more secure" decision would need to be made ahead of time by the vendor.  And obviously, one size does not fit all.  Thoughts?  What is stopping you from enabling PIE for everything, at least on the platform?
