A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause an application using Jansson to use an excessive amount of CPU time by sending a crafted JSON document containing a large number of parameters whose names map to the same hash value.  With regards to affected versions, I am guessing only and were checked (by Red Hat).  Many thanks to Florian Weimer and Petri Lehtinen (upstream) for their extensive work on the patch:   (Feel free to copy the above description paragraph in any of your bugs or advisories.)  Red Hat bug: (to be opened shortly)  Cheers,  -- Murray McAllister / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
