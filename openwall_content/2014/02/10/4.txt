By exploiting a hash table collision, an attacker has no way to trigger a DoS,  but he can actually do something way more interesting: force the resolver to  send the same query for the same TLD, over and over again, always to the same  set of servers, no matter what the intended TTL is and no matter what the  cache size is.  And suddenly, poisoning dnscache with a malicious TLD much, much, much easier  and faster. ===  Not sure if it qualifies for a CVE; the excerpt above deems it a likely  candidate.  Upstream fix: -------------    ->   Thank you. -- Prasad J Pandit / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
