The latter kind is much easier to exploit, at least on some systems,  because commandlines are not secret.  * eyeD3:  * Tom Duff's rc (part of 9base):  * Byron Rakitzis's rc:  * Gamera:  * RPLY (follow-up for  --  Jakub Wilk  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
