It is conceivable for a CVE assignment to apply to a combination of two products, and not apply to either product alone, but we prefer not to do that if there's any type of (partial) agreement that one product could be chosen.  Use for this issue in WebKit-GTK. When the issue is later listed on the web page, we will try to include a note that the WebKit-GTK behavior complies with existing W3C standards and existing practices for GNOME desktop integration.   > PulseAudio's security model is based on clients not sending malicious > requests to change the stream volume  If there ever happens to be a later vendor announcement that this model is incorrect, and that a different model is required as a security fix, then a second CVE assignment could be made.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =pkWX -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
