Please note that for CVEs assigned directly by Mitre this is the date Mitre created the CVE entry. For CVEs assigned by CNAs (e.g. Microsoft, Oracle, HP, Red Hat, etc.) this is also the date the entry was create by Mitre, not by the CNA. So in the case where a CNA requests a block of CVE numbers in advance (e.g. Red Hat currently requests CVEs in blocks of the entry date would be when that CVE is assigned to the CNA. The CVE itself may not be used for days, weeks, months or even possibly years (e.g. Red Hat maintains blocks of CVEs for older security issues in Open Source software that were not assigned a CVEs yet). =======  So late last year I asked for and received a block of CVE's from Mitre which we are now assigning as issues come to light. So yeah, we're all good.   - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =ypIU -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
