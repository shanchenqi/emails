We generally haven't been making CVE assignments for cases of desktop applications in which crafted input is entered interactively in the UI. The existence of a well-known flaw type (e.g., buffer overflow) and the existence of code to generate the crafted input haven't been considered relevant in the past.  Is the nature of the attack different here?  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =OhXv -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
