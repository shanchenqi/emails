It's uncommon to have different CVE mappings for Fedora-shipped versions versus upstream versions, but in this case we'll proceed to do that because the CVE abstraction was already stated that way, and the attack vectors are actually different.  catfish.py in the current working directory - Use  catfish.pyc in the current working directory - Use  bin/catfish.pyc under the current working directory - Use  bin/catfish.py under the current working directory - Use  If someone installs the upstream version of either catfish or catfish they get a script that unsafely looks for both catfish.pyc and catfish.py.  If someone installs either the Fedora 19 package or the Fedora 20 package, they get a script that unsafely looks for only catfish.py (twice).  This apparently occurs because of:  [Fedora 19 catfish.spec] %{__sed} -i.byte \         -e 's|pyc|py|' \         %{name}.in  [Fedora 20 catfish.spec] %{__sed} -i.byte \         -e 's|pyc|py|' \         bin/%{name}.in.in  We don't know why that was done. (Maybe Fedora has a policy against certain uses of .pyc files, and this policy is implemented in the .spec files of various packages?)  This specific case isn't very interesting because every one of the mentioned versions of catfish on every platform is actually vulnerable. However, probably no Fedora advisory should map to either or  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =3v2f -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
