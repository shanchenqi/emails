I reported and it is my opinion that this flaw needs a separate CVE ID to The Jenkins patch blocks DynamicProxyConverter from the Jenkins wrapper class XStream2, without changing the XStream library at all. This implements a less-general solution than the XStream patch for and the patch applies to a completely separate codebase (i.e. Jenkins itself,not XStream). Therefore it is my understanding that this flaw as it affects Jenkins qualifies for a unique CVE ID. When reporting this flaw to upstream, the Jenkins engineers agreed that it qualified for a unique CVE ID, and I offered to assign a CVE ID from the Red Hat CNA. This offer was refused, but then the advisory was released without a unique CVE ID, which is puzzling indeed. >  > Could someone from MITRE please weigh in and assign CVE IDs as appropriate for these flaws? >   Hi,  Is there any movement on this? The original request for CVE's came to oss-sec on the 17th.  Thanks.
