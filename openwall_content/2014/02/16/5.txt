[1]  Do some of the following need also a CVE assignment?  ----cut---------cut---------cut---------cut---------cut---------cut----- | In some places, Jenkins XML API uses XStream to deserialize arbitrary | content, which is affected by reported against XStream. | This allows malicious users of Jenkins with a limited set of permissions | to execute arbitrary code inside Jenkins master.   SECURITY-76 & SECURITY-88 / | Restrictions of HTML tags for user-editable contents are too lax. This | allows malicious users of Jenkins to trick other unsuspecting users into | providing sensitive information.   | Plugging a hole in the earlier fix to SECURITY-55. Under some | circimstances, a malicious user of Jenkins can configure job X to | trigger another job Y that the user has no access to.   | CLI job creation had a directory traversal vulnerability. This allows a | malicious user of Jenkins with a limited set of permissions to overwrite | files in the Jenkins master and escalate privileges.   | The embedded Winstone servlet container is susceptive to session | hijacking attack.  (issue in jenkins-winstone?)  SECURITY-93 | The password input control in the password parameter definition in the | Jenkins UI was serving the actual value of the password in HTML, not an | encrypted one. If a sensitive value is set as the default value of such | a parameter definition, it can be exposed to unintended audience.   SECURITY-89 | Deleting the user was not invalidating the API token, allowing users to | access Jenkins when they shouldn't be allowed to do so.   SECURITY-80 | Jenkins UI was vulnerable to click jacking attacks.   SECURITY-79 | "Jenkins' own user database" was revealing the presence/absence of users | when login attempts fail.   SECURITY-77 | Jenkins had a cross-site scripting vulnerability in one of its cookies. | If Jenkins is deployed in an environment that allows an attacker to | override Jenkins cookies in victim's browser, this vulnerability can be | exploited.   SECURITY-75 | Jenkins was vulnerable to session fixation attack. If Jenkins is | deployed in an environment that allows an attacker to override Jenkins | cookies in victim's browser, this vulnerability can be exploited.   SECURITY-74 | Stored XSS vulnerability. A malicious user of Jenkins with a certain set | of permissions can cause Jenkins to store arbitrary HTML fragment.   SECURITY-73 | Some of the system diagnostic functionalities were checking a lesser | permission than it should have. In a very limited circumstances, this | can cause an attacker to gain information that he shouldn't have | access to.  ----cut---------cut---------cut---------cut---------cut---------cut-----  Do some of these issue need a CVE assigned?
