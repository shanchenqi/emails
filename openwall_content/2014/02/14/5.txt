That CVE assignment would potentially be reasonable, but we wanted to first clarify what is being asked. We think you mean:    - adding a patch to initscripts to introduce more compatibility     between initscripts and systemd may be considered a security     enhancement, and probably would not be considered a vulnerability     fix, so no CVE ID is being requested for a problem in the     unpatched initscripts code    - this systemd commit              introduced the killall.c file. In the first version of this file, the         /* Non-root processes otherwise are always subject to be killed */        if (uid != 0)                return false;         ...         /* Processes with argv[0][0] = '@' we ignore from the killing         * spree.         *         * http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/RootStorageDaemons */         if (count == 1 && c == '@')                 return true;                 return false;      code was included.    - you are proposing that the above "return true" line is a     vulnerability because it may allow a not-fully-privileged root     user to cause data loss. This could possibly have one CVE ID. One     of the arguments against assigning a CVE ID is that this "return     true" could have been an intentional tradeoff between perfect     privilege checking and design complexity. For environments with     not-fully-privileged root users, we're not sure whether there's     general acceptable of a guideline that OS components must never     contain any program logic to make any security-relevant decision     on the basis of the uid value.    - versions of systemd before     in which killall.c did     not exist, may have had other problems because the right processes     were not killed at the right times. This could possibly have a     second CVE ID if there were security implications.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJS/kjTAAoJEKllVAevmvmsNHQH/AlPmrhJVIatj4vPKWj8bPSj =BYck -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
