The MediaWiki and release announcement notes:  * (bug SECURITY: Disallow uploading SVG files using non-whitelisted    namespaces. Also disallow iframe elements. User will get an error    including the namespace name if they use a non- whitelisted namespace.  An attacker could perform cross-site scripting attacks by uploading  crafted SVG images.  The versions of MediaWiki in Fedora and EPEL 6 are affected. I have not  tested EPEL 5.
