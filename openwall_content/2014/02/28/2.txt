In order to ensure full traceability, we need a CVE number assigned that we can attach to further notifications. This issue is already public, although an advisory was not sent yet.  Title: Trustee token revocation does not work with memcache backend Reporter: Morgan Fainberg (Metacloud) Products: Keystone Versions: up to and versions up to  Description: Morgan Fainberg from Metacloud reported a vulnerability in the Keystone memcache token backend. When a trustor issues a trust token with impersonation enabled, the token is only added to the trustor's token list and not to the trustee's token list. This results in the trust token not being invalidated by the trustee's token revocation (bulk revocation). This is most noticeable when the trustee user is disabled or the trustee changes a password. Only setups using the memcache backend for tokens in Keystone are affected.
