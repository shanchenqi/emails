The criticality of this issue is compounded by the fact that typically a  high-privilege account (i.e. having an access level >=  $g_view_configuration_threshold, which is set to ADMINISTRATOR by  default) is required to access this page.  Patches are attached to [1]. Can you please assign a CVE ID to this issue ?  Thank you  D.
