Use for changeset  There are at least two ways to handle the CVE assignments for the other issues. The problem is that was originally bound to the disclosure of "that's still 4 bytes too many" (in ImageMagick but this is apparently not an accurate description of the problem. (Possibly "4 bytes too many" was based on an incorrect interpretation that "L%02ld" meant two four-byte integer values, going into a single four-byte buffer.)  Option 1:  1a. REJECT  1b. Assign one new ID for the vulnerability in older ImageMagick versions that use the "L%02ld" string. The root cause here is that the code did not cover the case of more than 99 layers, which is apparently allowable but relatively uncommon. This has a resultant buffer overflow, e.g, is safe but is unsafe. When the overflow occurs, it can be described as "1 or more bytes too many."  1c. Assign another new ID for the vulnerability in newer ImageMagick versions that use the "L%06ld" string. The root cause here is that the code did not recognize the relationship between the 8 (or more) characters in "L%06ld" and the actual buffer size. This has a resultant buffer overflow of "4 or more bytes too many."  Option 2:  2a. Keep for the above-mentioned vulnerability in older ImageMagick versions. This preserves the original meaning of as a vulnerability affecting (for example) ImageMagick  2b. Assign a new ID for the above-mentioned vulnerability in newer ImageMagick versions.  (We will proceed with option 2 unless option 1 is substantially better for someone.)  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =2sDp -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
