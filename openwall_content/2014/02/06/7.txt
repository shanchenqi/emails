ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  libvchan (a library for inter-domain communication) does not correctly handle unusual or malicious contents in the xenstore ring.  A malicious guest can exploit this to cause a libvchan-using facility to read or write past the end of the ring.  IMPACT ======  libvchan-using facilities are vulnerable to denial of service and perhaps privilege escalation.  There are no such services provided in the upstream Xen Project codebase.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All versions of libvchan are vulnerable.  Only installations which use libvchan for communication involving untrusted domains are vulnerable.  libvirt, xapi, xend, libxl and xl do not use libvchan.  If your installation contains other Xen-related software components it is possible that they use libvchan and might be vulnerable.  Xen versions 4.1 and earlier do not contain libvchan.  MITIGATION ==========  Disabling libvchan-based facilities could be used to mitigate the vulnerability.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Marek Marczykowski-Gรณrecki of Invisible Things Lab.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.  After the patch is applied to the Xen tree and built, any software which is statically linked against libvchan will need to be relinked against the new libvchan.a for the fix to take effect.  xsa86.patch        Xen 4.2.x, 4.3.x, 4.4-RC series, and xen-unstable  $ xsa86*.patch  xsa86.patch $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =XbpF -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment "xsa86.patch" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
