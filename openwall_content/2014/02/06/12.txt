When a file  has an empty security context, listing it via 'ls(1)' could trigger this  crash. Only user/processes with CAP_MAC_ADMIN privileges are allowed to set  the SELinux security context of a file.  A user/process with CAP_MAC_ADMIN privileges could use this flaw to crash the  kernel, resulting in a DoS.
