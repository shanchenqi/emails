If the vulnerabilities in the OTRv1 protocol were completely resolved (perhaps this is, in practice, essentially impossible), then the downgrade would probably not be considered a security problem. That would mean that a separate CVE assignment would not be made, because of the lack of an independent vulnerability.  Occasionally a vendor who is the original author of software chooses to describe a protocol-downgrade issue as a software mistake, requiring a CVE, such as and In other cases, a protocol-downgrade capability was an intentional aspect of a design, and had some importance for compatibility, but became problematic once the earlier protocol was documented as insecure. In that case, preventing a downgrade could be seen as a security enhancement.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =jNKp -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
