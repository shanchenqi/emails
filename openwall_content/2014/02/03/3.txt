Unfortunately, your two attached files - nox32recvmmsg.c and Makefile - arrived each in a separate message, with the content yEnc encoded:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YEnc  Moreover, at least nox32recvmmsg.c definitely looks wrong - only 5 bytes of the encoding are present:  =ybegin part=1 name=nox32recvmmsg.c =ypart begin=0 end=5 =yend size=5 part=1  (where the portion is literal 8-bit characters).  The rest of nox32recvmmsg.c is nowhere to be seen.  The Makefile could be OK, but without the .c file it's useless.  As a moderator, I'll reject those other two messages since they're of little use.  Rather than post via Gmane's NNTP gateway, can you please reply to this message with the files MIME-attached, or include the files in message body with some sort of delimiters (e.g. Phrack-style)?
