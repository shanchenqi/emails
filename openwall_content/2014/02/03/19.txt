No one from another distribution responded with specific details that were different from this "aren't security flaws, precisely" statement. So, we will make the CVE assignments on the basis of the original report.  > The Enlightenment window manager (enlightenment.org) was found to ship > with (a) a setuid root helper that did not effectively sanitize its > environment and (b) a weak default configuration.

Use for this issue in which gdb is available unsafely in the unpatched codebase.   In this interpretation, "and (b) a weak default configuration. Users in select groups could exploit this to execute arbitrary programs as root" means that at least one not-equivalent-to-root user is able to execute the helper program. In other words, it is not an independent vulnerability.  A specific Linux distribution might, for example, have an implementation error in determining who is allowed to execute the helper program. If anything like that is reported, additional CVE assignments would be possible.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =Ft+z -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
