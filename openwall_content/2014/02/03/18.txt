Relevant code was: 1) never enabled, 2) never advertised in release notes, and 3) never had a configuration option. To enable it, a user would have to pro-actively edit code (more than merely a configure flag). Note: I *did* read MITRE's justification on this last point.  Also, an attacker would need to make EVP_Digest* fail. Is there a known way to achieve this?  Finally, the NVD entry doesn't make sense. J-PAKE experimental code wasn't in the code-base until OpenSSH 5.2 (iirc) yet versions back to 1.2 are listed as vulnerable. Also, a CVSS score of 7.5 (High)? I know this is  orthogonal to the actual CVE assignment. Still...weird.  I don't have a horse in this race but the entire situation strikes me incongruent.  --mancha       Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
