Please remember that many subscribers to this  list are not part of your project or company. As such, please clearly  identify the product in the subject line.  Just including a sub-component or vulnerable functions and/or a CVE does  not tell us what software the mail is about. This has gotten out of hand  and in at least one case in the past few days, the entire mail never  clearly stated the software that was vulnerable. Sure, most of us know the  poster and it followed other advisories, but to newcomers or anyone  reaching that post via a Google search it is not very friendly.  Thanks,  jericho / OSVDB.org    Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
