Are you possibly referring to the three Ruby advisories posted on   If so, I doubt Aaron will notice your request - I think he's not subscribed.  You might want to e-mail him privately, in case he intends to post more advisories in the future.  Or maybe you were referring to Vincent's CVE request for CGI::Application, which didn't mention Perl in the Subject line (but did in the message body)?  This one actually looks OK with respect to your request, since CGI::Application appears to be a product on its own (not bundled with Perl).   I find no other examples of this problem "in the past few days", although of course we've seen it numerous times before.
