I don't understand. How is it relevant that it was not well understood at  the time when software was written? It is still an issue. And that argument  could be true for many other issues. Like the JSON library example earlier  in this thread, or   ->  ->  | CVE does, as a secondary form of inclusion, cover vulnerability | advisories from a vendor who was the original author of a piece of | software and publishes a change as a required security update. That is | unlikely here; nobody is anticipating    Woh..woh..woh!!! Please note that the CVE is requested for 'New-djbdns'.  New-djbdns is a fully fledged, production quality, fast growing fork of  the 'djbdns'.    New-djbdns -> http://pjp.dgplug.org/ndjbdns/  I am the upstream developer and Fedora package maintainer of this project. I  assure you, version is brewing and brewing good. It'll be served when it  is ready.  I request you to kindly assign a CVE for this and the other issue in  New-djbdns. Lot of users depend of it.
