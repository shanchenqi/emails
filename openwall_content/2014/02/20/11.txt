Otherwise MITRE attempts to use the best available information in deciding whether "security improvement" is a better categorization. Across all types of products and problems, the original author is generally allowed to admit that they made a mistake when writing the code in a certain way.  > So now SipHash is 'the only' way to avoid hash collision ever?  At present, introducing SipHash is a type of patch that's very likely to be considered when a software maintainer is responding to hash-collision problems. Certainly other patch approaches are possible. Not all code originated with an implicit functional specification that the code would do a good job at resisting all types of intentional hash-collision attacks. So, in general, when a description of a new attack is published, any resulting patches can be considered security improvements.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =Ycsb -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
