I feel that they'd be partially out-of-context, and I feel that the discussion on the Debian bug might go for a long while (this is fine on its own, but not for having it all CC'ed to oss-security).  I reluctantly approved Petter's posting, although it was unclear if it was CC'ed to oss-security on purpose or accidentally.  FYI, the thread on oss-security started here:   and you may see follow-ups (which were _not_ CC'ed to the Debian bug) via the "thread-next" link.  Dimitri, since you were the one to add the CC:, what would you like us to do?  So far, Petter's is the only such comment CC'ed to oss-security after yours, but I suspect that many more comments will be posted to the Debian bug later (since there's no consensus), and many may/would be CC'ed to oss-security without specific reason (OK, maybe my bringing the question up will affect this and it won't be happening).  I think it may be appropriate to discuss non-security/development aspects of this issue on the Debian bug and maybe on the Distributions list:  http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/distributions/  and security aspects on oss-security.  Or is this separation not justified?  Maybe I am imagining the threat of this turning into a lengthy thread that is only tangential for oss-security?  I don't intend to spam the Debian bug by CC'ing it on many more messages like this, yet I felt I should keep it in the loop this time.  Thanks,  Alexander  P.S.
