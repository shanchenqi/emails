If we are going to implement this systemd compatibility, it might be better to implement it as a option for killall5, instead of faking omitpid values.  Anyone willing to write such implementation?  killall5 already know about all processes and their names, and asking it to ignore processes matching some regular expression should not be very hard.  --  Happy hacking Petter Reinholdtsen  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
