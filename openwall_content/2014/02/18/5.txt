First, the product ends up trying a cleartext login even though the --tls option is provided on the command line. This is assigned (Moving to a cleartext session in reaction to a certificate-verification failure would typically always be wrong for any product.)  Second, the product is trying a cleartext login even though the server sent LOGINDISABLED. RFC section says "A client implementation MUST NOT send a LOGIN command if the LOGINDISABLED capability is advertised."  (The discussion also reported a third problem: "The user is never notified of the certificate issue." That one is most likely, by itself, outside the scope of CVE. If a product refused to operate in an unsafe certificate situation, and did not tell the user why it was refusing, that would potentially be a usability problem. That would not be an independent vulnerability that could have a CVE ID.)  The patch in:     seems to change:     $imap->starttls(  ) if ( $imap->Tls(  ) ) ;  to:     if ( $imap->Tls(  ) ) {           $imap->starttls(  )           or die_clean("Can not go to tls encryption on [$host]:", $imap->LastError, "\n" ) ;    }  in two places.  The second issue (proceeding when LOGINDISABLED is advertised) would also be relevant if it occurred when the client did not include --tls on the command line. If anyone has observed that, a second CVE ID could be assigned. This is a protocol violation with security implications. Compliant client software is supposed to look for LOGINDISABLED in all cases, presumably including cases in which the end user is not explicitly requesting a TLS session.  Finally, https://github.com/imapsync/imapsync/issues/15 ends with     there's still something weird, since I found that:        --ssl1 --tls2 fails on host2 login with "Unable to start TLS: Cannot determine peer hostname for verification"    --tls1 --tls2 succeeds    --tls2 succeeds    --tls1 --ssl2 succeeds  We couldn't immediately determine if that's simply a functionality problem, or whether another vulnerability exists (e.g., if the correct behavior were "fails" in all four cases, but with some combinations of command-line options, there's no attempt to check a server hostname).  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =aR5P -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
