Specially crafted strings can be used to save data in PostgreSQL array columns that may not be intended. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier  Versions Affected:  4.0.x, Not affected:       3.2.x and older Fixed Versions:      Impact ------ Specially crafted strings may be used to save data to array columns in PostgreSQL databases. This vulnerability cannot be used to delete data or execute arbitrary SQL statements, but *can* be used to add data that could have an impact on the application (such as setting an admin flag). Only array type columns in PostgreSQL are impacted.  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the work arounds immediately.  Releases -------- The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds ----------- To work around this issue, apply this monkey patch:  ```ruby module ActiveRecord   module ConnectionAdapters     class PostgreSQLColumn       module Cast         alias :old_quote_and_escape :quote_and_escape          ARRAY_ESCAPE = "\\" * 2 * 2 # escape the backslash twice for PG arrays         def quote_and_escape(value)           case value           when "NULL", Numeric             value           else             value = value.gsub(/\\/, ARRAY_ESCAPE)             value.gsub!(/"/,"\\\"")             "\"#{value}\""           end         end       end     end   end end ```  Patches ------- To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.  * 4-1-beta-array_injection.patch - Patch for 4.1-beta series * 4-0-array_injection.patch - Patch for 4.0 series  Credits -------  Thanks Godfrey Chan for reporting this!  --  Aaron Patterson http://tenderlovemaking.com/  View attachment "4-0-array_injection.patch" of type "text/plain" bytes)  View attachment "4-1-beta-array_injection.patch" of type "text/plain" bytes)  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
