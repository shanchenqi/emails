This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier  Versions Affected: 3.0.x, 3.1.x, 3.2.x Not affected: 4.0.x Fixed Versions:  Impact ------  Strings sent in specially crafted headers will be converted to symbols. This can cause a denial of service since symbols are not removed by the garbage collector. All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the work arounds immediately.  Releases --------  The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds -----------  Users who cannot upgrade may apply this monkey patch as an initializer to work around the issue:  ``` ActiveSupport.on_load(:action_view) do   ActionView::Template::Text.class_eval do     def formats       [@mime_type.respond_to?(:ref) ? @mime_type.ref : @mime_type.to_s]     end   end end ```  Patches -------  To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.   * 3-2-render_text_dos.patch - Patch for 3.2 series  * 3-1-render_text_dos.patch - Patch for 3.1 series  * 3-0-render_text_dos.patch - Patch for 3.0 series  Please note that only the 4.0.x and 3.2.x series are supported at present. Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.
