To provide an initial response to this: MITRE will look into the relationships among and but at this point has not accepted the statement that must be marked as a duplicate.  Again, from:      http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~shmat/shmat_ndss14nofrak.pdf  The scope of is the following description of a specific change made by a vendor in response to a vulnerability:    On Android prior to API level 17, these interfaces are   generically insecure. Malicious JavaScript executing inside   WebView can use the Java reflection API to invoke any method   of any Java object exposed via 'addJavascriptInterface' and   take control over the local side of the application.   Starting from Android API level 17, only the methods explicitly   annotated with @JavascriptInterface are visible in the Java   objects exposed to WebView via 'addJavascriptInterface'.  The scope of is only the role of the searchBoxJavaBridge_ object as a specific attackable object.  The outcome with respect to will depend on several factors, including MITRE's assessment of whether the wider community has been using for purposes other than tracking updates offered by Japanese handset manufacturers.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =TFYk -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
