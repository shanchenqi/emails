MODX Revolution release announcement: says "Prevent XSS on actionVar in header.tpl in the Manager"  This is the git commit:  I haven't found any other public sources / advisories for the XSS, so I assume it was detected by the MODX devs themselves.   cu, --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
