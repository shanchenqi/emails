Could a CVE be assigned to this please?  A Debian bug report indicated that catfish suffers from some bad logic when loading the catfish.py script from the /usr/bin/catfish script.  This script intentionally looks to load catfish.py in the current working directory.  If a user were to run catfish in an untrusted directory that contained a malicious catfish.py, that script would be executed with the privileges of the user running catfish.  This script:  #!/usr/bin/env bash  APPNAME=catfish  if [ -e $APPNAME.py ]     then python $APPNAME.py "$@"     else         if [ -e $APPNAME.py ]             then python $APPNAME.py "$@"             else                 cd /usr/share/$APPNAME                 if [ -e $APPNAME.py ]                     then python $APPNAME.py "$@"                     else                         python $APPNAME.py "$@"                 fi         fi     fi  should probably be:  #!/bin/sh python /usr/share/catfish.py "$@"  The rest is just development fluff and very poorly written.
