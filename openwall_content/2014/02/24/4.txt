We recognize that there's a significant number of issues that fall into the general category of "it could be useful to draw attention to this aspect of a security model, because the documentation is arguably inconsistent or obscure, and this may result in risks to end users." Currently, the scope of CVE identifiers doesn't really extend to these types of "useful to draw attention" identifiers.  What we can do is assign a CVE ID if any vendor bundles a copy of Redis with a default directory of /tmp, and decides to make a security announcement about that. We feel there's a distinction between "there's nothing stopping an end user from choosing a world-writable dataset directory" and "it ships world-writable."  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =Gvye -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
