This would be the case if, for example, there was a January a2ps package that fixed part of the problem with temporary files. Admittedly, the practical value of two IDs at present may be extremely small.  The information does not seem to be in a2ps.git because data before is unavailable, e.g.,     Also:      You are not authorized to access bug  If (as we would expect) nobody is interested in checking that, we will assign one ID.  Finally, the earlier abstraction question is no longer relevant because Jakub Wilk is apparently not the original discoverer of any part of the problem.
