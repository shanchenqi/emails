This is another case where I have a hard time complying to them.  python-gnupg lists in the changelog: "Added improved shell quoting to guard against shell injection." Source: https://code.google.com/p/python-gnupg/  Sounds like a severe security issue, but further info is lacking. python-gnupg has no public source code repository, so I can't link to any commit. I could obviously download the last and current version, diff them and try to find out. But that's quite a lot of work for a CVE request.  Despite the lack of info, please assign CVE, as I think it's a severe issue.  cu, --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
