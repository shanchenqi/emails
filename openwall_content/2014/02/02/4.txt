The configuration file can specify a directory to load libraries from, so this would have been an issue if running fwsnort in an attacker-controlled directory.  Michael Rash has released to fix this issue:  http://www.cipherdyne.org/fwsnort/download/ https://github.com/mrash/fwsnort/blob/master/ChangeLog  The patch (with further issue details) for is:   For the affected versions, I had only tested (on Fedora and EPEL).
