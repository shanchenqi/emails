Hannes Sowa pointed out to me that djbdns deliberately does not prevent  cache eviction by crafted queries/responses:  "dnscache doesn't discriminate against additional records. Valid records  are accepted whether they're additional records in one packet or answer  records in the next; timing doesn't affect the semantics."  <http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/notes.html>  The issue raised in this thread only allows to carry out "attacks" that  are also possible by relying on a documented design decision, so it's  doubtful this qualifies as a security bug.  (Note that most resolver implementations also lack protection against  cache eviction.  Several vendors reviewed this topic in and deemed  it too difficult to implement as a general security feature.)  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
