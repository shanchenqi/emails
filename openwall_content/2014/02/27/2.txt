This says "Initialy reported by Daniel Kahn Gillmor on but that seems to be a typo of (aka because the actual report was in:      >  > This did not affect applications that used > verification flag, which instructs > GnuTLS to allow root CA certificates to be version 1 certificates. > This was set by e.g. gnutls-cli client application in GnuTLS versions > affected by this bug.  Is this setting in gnutls-cli itself a vulnerability, because is an unsafe flag for any general-purpose application? For example,     says:       This one is quite dangerous. It allows any intermediate V1 certificate   to be used as a signer. This means that if I manage to get a CA to give   me a V1 personal certificate, I can act as a CA if this flag is set.   (In other words, all three CVEs would have the same impact -- something roughly like "allows remote attackers to have an unintended ability to issue new certificates by using an arbitrary V1 certificate -- but two of the CVEs have a root cause of logic errors in flag operations, whereas the proposed third CVE has a root cause of a hardcoded unsafe configuration choice in gnutls-cli.)  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =a0uN -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
