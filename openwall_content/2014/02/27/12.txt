We received this bugreport for the KDE default webbrowser Konqueror:  Basically https://www.howsmyssl.com reports that even the weak EXPORT ciphera are in use by konqueror.  And yes, it is right... DES40, RC2, DES_CBC  (single DES) ... should definitely not be used these days anymore.   Do you think use of export ciphers should get CVEs these days?  It does not seem intentional, konqueror just uses everything openssl has without explicit filtering by default.  I also failed to find a module to configure the ciphers in the KDE configuration module jungle.
