Is the intent here to assign to all issues rooted in reliance on an incorrectly exposed Javascript bridge?  If so, please keep in mind that this issue is not as simple as pointing at Android itself. If a vulnerable app is compiled against a vulnerable API level of the SDK (even today) it would be vulnerable. At least that is my current understanding. As such, additional assignments on a per-app or per-ad-network-SDK may be necessary due to these exposure lifetime complications.  You may have seen recently released Metasploit module that allows a remote compromise of the Google Glass browser using an incorrectly exposed Javascript bridge via the "searchBoxJavaBridge_" object. This exposes an instance of android.webkit.SearchBoxImpl in older versions of the Android browser.  If this issue should have the same CVE assignment, please ack. Otherwise, please assign a new CVE.
