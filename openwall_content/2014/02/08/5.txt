The tracker only containing public data, it means that the ids are not embargoed.  Hopefully these lists can be useful to MITRE to catch up on those, or to anyone else. I can generate these and other reports regularly if desired.  Notes: * The year in the file name corresponds to the year in the CVE id, not necessarily the year of assignment. * The lists only contain the CVE id, probably a short description, and one line of data from our tracker. The full data can be obtained either by going to https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-YYYY-XXXX or by looking up on our text database.
