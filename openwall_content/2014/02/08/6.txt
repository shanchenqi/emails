The MantisBT SOAP API uses the unsafe db_query() function allowing a specially crafted tag within the envelope of a mc_issue_attachment_get SOAP request to inject arbitrary SQL queries.  The reporting of this specific issue was followed by an investigation that lead to additional cases of unsafe db_query() function use, being found by MantisBT maintainers, throughout MantisBT code.
