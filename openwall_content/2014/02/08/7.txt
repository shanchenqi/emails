There is no CVE assignment for this. Here, "no authentication is required" is probably best considered an opportunity for security enhancement. (For example, there are many other applications that provide other types of port forwarding in other contexts, and don't implement authentication.)   > Issue #2 - Lack of hardening when compiling for a host >  > When investigating whether or not this particular issue was > exploitable, it was determined that the "adb" binary supplied by > Google does not contain two crucial modern protection mechanisms. > Those are: non-executable stack protection and binary base > randomization (PIE).

Absense of these types of protection mechanisms can have a CVE ID in some cases, but the CVE project typically proceeds only in instances where an upstream vendor chooses to make an announcement that this was a software mistake. An example is A third-party report could be used in a limited set of scenarios, e.g., a build process that has a list of files requiring safe compilation options, with a typo in one of the filenames. Similarly, if the available information is that the vendor intentionally disabled this type of a protection mechanism, a CVE assignment can't be made.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =Nfx1 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
