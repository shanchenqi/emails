The scope of is the following description of a specific change made by a vendor in response to a vulnerability:    On Android prior to API level 17, these interfaces are   generically insecure. Malicious JavaScript executing inside   WebView can use the Java reflection API to invoke any method   of any Java object exposed via 'addJavascriptInterface' and   take control over the local side of the application.   Starting from Android API level 17, only the methods explicitly   annotated with @JavascriptInterface are visible in the Java   objects exposed to WebView via 'addJavascriptInterface'.  Our expectation is that a number of issues "rooted in reliance on an incorrectly exposed Javascript bridge" could have their own separate CVEs.  > You may have seen recently released Metasploit module that allows a > remote compromise of the Google Glass browser using an incorrectly > exposed Javascript bridge ... >  > If this issue should have the same CVE assignment, please ack. > Otherwise, please assign a new CVE.  We'll send a separate message soon about this Google Glass CVE request. We don't want to have CVE assignments for separately reported issues in this thread.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =STCe -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
