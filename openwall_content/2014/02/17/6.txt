Thank you for confirming. > >   So, does this qualify for a CVE?   I think I've come around to a yes for this one. Pushing attacker-chosen entries out of the cache after only packets is clearly not what the admin wants.  It makes a secondary attack (DNS over UDP blind cache poisoning) much more viable than it was.  I can think of some DoS scenarios where this vector would assist another attack.
