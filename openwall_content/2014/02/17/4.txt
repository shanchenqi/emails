An unprivileged local user with access to cifs share could use this flaw to crash the system or leak kernel memory. Privilege escalation cannot be ruled out (since memory corruption is involved), but is unlikely.  References:  Upstream patch:  Patches have been reported to the linux-cifs mailing list:   Only the first patch is required to fix the flaw.  The second patch is to ensure that this does not get hit again in the future by adding extra protection.
