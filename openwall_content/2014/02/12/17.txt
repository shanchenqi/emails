ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  If xc_cpumap_alloc() fails then xc_cpupool_getinfo() will free and incorrectly return the then-free pointer to the result structure.  IMPACT ======  An attacker may be able to cause a multi-threaded toolstack using this function to race against itself leading to heap corruption and a potential DoS.  Depending on the malloc implementation, privilege escalation cannot be ruled out.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  The flaw is present in Xen 4.1 onwards.  Only multithreaded toolstacks are vulnerable.  Only systems where management functions (such as domain creation) are exposed to untrusted users are vulnerable.  xl is not multithreaded, so is not vulnerable.  However, multithreaded toolstacks using libxl as a library are vulnerable.  xend is vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  Not allowing untrusted users access to toolstack functionality will avoid this issue.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Coverity Scan and diagnosed by Andrew Cooper.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.  xsa88.patch        xen-unstable, Xen 4.3.x, Xen 4.2.x, Xen 4.1.x  $ xsa88*.patch  xsa88.patch $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =1It2 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment "xsa88.patch" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
