The librsync attack is far easier to perform, since there's no whole-file checksum and it will simply copy the first instance of a collision into any place where the second collision is.  The rdiff utility that ships with librsync truncates hashes to 8 bytes, allowing a very fast and efficient birthday attack - so even if MD4 was replaced attacks would still be possible while the hash is truncted.  This also affects duplicity - they both use RS_DEFAULT_STRONG_LEN - so the _librsyncmodule that ships with duplicity will need recompiling after the fix ships.
