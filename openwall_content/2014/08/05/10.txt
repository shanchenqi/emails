In order to ensure full traceability, we need CVE number(s) assigned that we can attach to further notifications. These issues are already public, although an advisory was not sent yet.  Title: Multiple vulnerabilities in Keystone revocation events Reporter: Lance Bragstad (Rackspace) and Brant Knudson (IBM) Products: Keystone Versions: versions up to  Description: Lance Bragstad from Rackspace and Brant Knudson from IBM reported 3 vulnerabilities in Keystone revocation events. Lance Bragstad discovered that UUID v2 tokens processed by the V3 API are incorrectly updated and get their "issued_at" time regenerated. Brant Knudson discovered that the MySQL token driver stores expiration dates incorrectly which prevents manual revocation and that domain-scoped tokens don't get revoked when the domain is disabled. Tokens impacted by one of these bugs may allow a user to evade token revocation. Only Keystone setups configured to use revocation events are affected.
