However, we don't immediately see a security problem in version (only a usability problem), so a second CVE ID isn't assigned at this point.  Specifically, the latest version has:       system("head -$lines $fname | xmllint --recover - > $fname");  which looks unintended (maybe $fname will always end up as a zero-length file?).   This apparently also affects libxml-dt-perl from the https://packages.debian.org/sid/libxml-dt-perl page.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =dNlw -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
