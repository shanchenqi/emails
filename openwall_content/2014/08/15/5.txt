Just cutting-and-pasting from our bug entry:  It was reported that accountsservice invokes usermod with the -p parameter when calling SetPassword(), which can leak encrypted passwords locally (being that they are briefly visible via ps).  As noted in the upstream bug:  The relevant code is in src/user.c in the user_change_password_authorized_cb() function:          argv[0] = "/usr/sbin/usermod";         argv[1] = "-p";         argv[2] = strings[0];         argv[3] = "--";         argv[4] = user->user_name;         argv[5] = NULL;  strings[0] has been set to the crypted password in user_set_password(). The crypted password has been passed from the client (ie: gnome-control-center).  This has not yet been corrected upstream.
