[...]  As someone who helps operate a fairly large listserv myself, this has been coming up a lot lately with our subscribers. The official recommendations from the DMARC coalition (as far as I've been able to tell) are published at http://www.dmarc.org/faq.html#s_3  The "solution" my fellow sysadmins and I have been leaning toward is to unsubscribe and reject subscription requests for any address at an obviously DMARC-enforcing domain, and start building a blacklist (if someone else already has a DNS-based RBL for this, I'd be quite interested to use and possible help maintain it as well). MTA operators enforcing DMARC quite obviously wish to go play in their own sandbox where a small (statistically, though still quite important in my opinion) traditional E-mail use case is simply not considered worth supporting. I'm personally perfectly happy if nobody at one of those domains ever receives an E-mail message from me again. --  Jeremy Stanley  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
