S. Vicetto" <jmbsvicetto@...il.com> To: oss-security <oss-security@...ts.openwall.com> Subject: Fwd: ezmlm warning  Hi.  I'm forwarding this email to the ml as I just noticed this is the 3rd time since Jun 19th that because of DMARC emails from some members are being rejected by receivers domains, like gmail for me. As I don't recall reading about this topic before in this ml, I'm raising the issue in case others are unaware and start getting warnings for losing emails or are surprised by some members not getting their emails. >From the warnings sent to me, this seems to have affected messages with numbers and I'm not sure if at this point there's anything that can be done by members to avoid losing emails - except perhaps using a different mail service or hosting their own as it seems unlikely that gmail, yahoo and others can be forced to change their policies. I first heard about this from my colleague at Gentoo Robin H. Johnson (robbat2), who raised this issue with the IETF[1]. I see that gmail now has a support article about it as well[2].
