In short, only “students, the press (if the use is for  media coverage), private persons and hobby researchers” can  use/view/access Secunia vulnerability data.  Non-profit organizations, private companies, and public authorities and  entities are NOT allowed to access or use any Secunia data, for any reason.  The revised EULA can be found here: http://secunia.com/community/profile/ under the “Create Profile” tab.  You may wish to review their EULA to ensure that you're in compliance.
