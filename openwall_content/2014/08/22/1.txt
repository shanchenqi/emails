This is assigned  and are about one or more issues in which there is unexpected cleartext e-mail transmission unrelated to use of Bcc. This perhaps requires a non-default configuration. It is conceivable -- although perhaps unlikely -- that the problem is a UI bug (e.g., an encryption choice is presented even when the product is configured to never use encryption). In any case, none of this has a CVE assignment yet. There isn't enough information to determine whether to assign zero, one, or two additional CVE IDs. The scope of is only the behavior that occurs when all recipients are Bcc recipients.
