Yes, a product with an affected JSONP endpoint can have its own   individual CVE ID. It is also possible that the vendor of a   JSONP endpoint has determined that a successful attack is entirely   the fault of the SWF parser, and does not want to have a CVE ID.   This might, hypothetically, occur if the JSONP response from a   product is always noncompliant SWF data, but some SWF parsers accept   it anyway. ]   > * (bug SECURITY: Fix for XSS issue in bug Generate the > URL used for loading a new page in Javascript,instead of relying on > the URL in the link that has been clicked. > ** Standard Dom XSS.
