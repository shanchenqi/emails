Hi,  does someone happen to know in which released kernel version this bug got introduced?  Was it always there since remounting of bind mounts was possible?  according to debian this at least affects kernels in oldstable:   Sadly I can't find any other public available bugtracker from redhat, gentoo etc. who track these.  --  Mit freundlichen Grüßen / Regards  Sven Kieske  Systemadministrator Mittwald CM Service GmbH & Co.
