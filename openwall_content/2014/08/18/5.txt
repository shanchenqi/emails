It was found in software from the Monkey Project (monkey-project.com), which develop the open-source Monkey Web Server.  This is the first such request and the issue is (now) public; this message serves as an advisory as well.  Affected software: Monkey Web Server Description: When the File Descriptor Table (FDT) mechanism is enabled (the default setting), any HTTP requests that result in a custom error message being returned cause a file descriptor (to the custom error message content file) to be leaked. An attacker can therefore repeatedly send such requests so as to leak a large number of descriptors. Eventually, the server will reach the OS-enforced per-process limit on the amount of open file descriptors (as given by `ulimit -n`). From this point on, and until the server is restarted, any request that requires the opening of another file in order to be handled will fail; even valid requests from other parties for normal files will fail with an HTTP error. This is a simple denial-of-service attack. Workaround: Do not use custom error messages, or disable the File Descriptor Table by using the "FDT off" directive in the server configuration file (see http://monkey-project.com/documentation/1.5/configuration/server.html#fdt).
