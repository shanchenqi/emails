I see from the Enigmail "Announcements" forum [1] that some major changes have been made to the package over the last 24 months: specifically a decision was made to replace older C++ code (with maintainability issues) by new pure Javascript code, thus hopefully achieving platform, GPG and TB version independence  You can see how that sort of upheaval in the codebase might result in horrible problems like this.  [ I switched away from TB to Claws/Kmail some time ago, so this is all news to me, but up till that point the behaviour of TB V3 - 10 and Enigmail in encrypting my mail was never less than excellent for me. ]  More relevantly, the (primary ?) author specifically asked [2] for testers to step up and test the new Javascript version thoroughly    "In order to reduce the risk of severe errors in    the release versions, I will regularly ask for help    in testing after I completed such changes."  which leaves me wondering how many stepped up to perform that task. It would be interesting - and maybe alarming - to know.  [1] http://sourceforge.net/p/enigmail/forum/announce/ [2]  Nick --  "Bob has a problem requiring secure communication.
