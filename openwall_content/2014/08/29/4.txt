The affected code looks like:   [...]   7 my $tmpfilename = "/tmp/clipedit$$";     8 open my $tmpfile, ">$tmpfilename" or die "Failure to open $tmpfilename: $!";     9 print $tmpfile $orig;    10 close $tmpfile;  [...]  13 system($ed, $tmpfilename);    14     15 open $tmpfile, $tmpfilename or die "Failure to open $tmpfilename: $!";  16 my $edited = join '', <$tmpfile>;  [...]  49 unlink($tmpfilename) or die "Couldn't remove $tmpfilename: $!";  Could you assing a CVE for this issue?
