Use Some additional details, probably less relevant to most readers, are included below.   > (This may be similar sort of issue to  We don't think it is especially similar. is about information leaks in the caching implementation of Intel x86 processors. The existing CVE that is related to the above reference is  More specifically, is about the http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~tromer/handsoff/ document. This document says "We have disclosed our attack to GnuPG developers under suggested suitable countermeasures, and worked with the developers to test them. New versions of GnuPG 1.x and of libgcrypt (which underlies GnuPG 2.x), containing these countermeasures and resistant to the key-extraction attack described here, were released concurrently with the first public posting of these results. GnuPG version onwards, and libgcrypt onwards, resist the key-extraction attack described here." The authors of this document may have intended for to apply to both the acoustic attack vector and the "exposed metal" attack vector. Also, note that the primary reference does mention "exposed metal" (first line of page 5). However, that reference does not demonstrate how to use "exposed metal" to exploit a vulnerability. Furthermore, http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~tromer/handsoff/ says:    Q5: What's new since your paper on acoustic cryptanalysis?   New attack channels. The new channels discussed here are physically   different than the acoustic channel, and result in different attack   scenarios.  Thus, we think it is best to have a separate CVE ID for the new information about the use of "exposed metal" in practical vulnerability exploitation, and to maintain as bound solely to acoustic attacks. Please keep in mind, though, that the vector difference between and is based only on different science, not different software behavior. As far as we know, the acoustic attack and "exposed metal" attack are characterized by:    - the same affected and unaffected versions of every product   - the same underlying issue in the code   - the same code fixes (e.g., ciphertext normalization and ciphertext     randomization)  Specifically, the primary reference says "New versions of GnuPG ... and libgcrypt, containing these countermeasures and resisting our current key-extraction attack, were released concurrently with this paper's first public posting." We think this means that Libgcrypt had the fix, even though does not mention fixing an acoustic issue.  Finally, about other vulnerabilities that are different from both and  1. Both the primary reference and the primary reference mention that RSA key distinguishability remains present in all software versions. The primary reference adds that "mitigating it in software, without a large overhead, remains an open problem." There is currently no CVE ID for this key-distinguishability issue. At least at present, the rationale is roughly that preventing key distinguishability is outside the scope of what the software offers.  2. The Description section of refers to the above but lists as a reference. This CCS.pdf document seems to be completely unrelated to the acoustic and "exposed metal" issues. If anyone is interested in one or more IDs for CCS.pdf, please specify what aspects of the paper are about vulnerabilities that belong in CVE, and whether you feel that each is a vulnerability in GnuPG or libgcrypt, or a vulnerability in Xen.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =YPoP -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
