There is at least one specification suggesting that this is wrong:       Pathnames that end with one or more trailing <slash> characters must   refer to directory paths. Earlier versions of this standard were not   specific about the distinction between trailing <slash> characters   on files and directories, and both were permitted.  Without going into the question of whether Plack is responsible for following that specification, it seems that the vendor identified arguably wrong behavior that had a security impact, and fixed it. Use  (In some related but non-identical situations -- for example, if a product decided to reject a valid pathname such as /etc//// as a possibly misguided attempt at security hardening -- there wouldn't be a CVE ID.)  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =e2Sd -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
