It is also possible to bypass flags like nodev, nosuid, and noexec.  This problem affects sandboxing / containerization systems that do not expose the regular filesystem to the sandboxed process, but do expose a bind-mounted view of that filesystem using these flags to enforce security. This bug may enable a sandbox break-out. Sandboxes which have used seccomp-bpf to disable the "mount" system call or to disable user namespaces are likely safe.  Eric Biederman has proposed the following patches to fix the problem:   -Kenton Varda, Sandstorm.io   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
