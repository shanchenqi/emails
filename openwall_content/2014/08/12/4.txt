ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Some MMU virtualization operations on HVM guests must process every page assigned to a guest.  For larger guests, this can tie up a vcpu for a significant amount of time, as the operations are not preemptible.  For guests using Hardware Assisted Paging (HAP, see below) this is  For guests not using HAP this is  IMPACT ======  A malicious HVM guest with a large allocation of shadow/p2m RAM can mount a denial of service attack affecting the whole system.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  ARM systems are not vulnerable.  All x86 Xen versions are vulnerable.  The vulnerability is only exposed to HVM guests.  In the default configuration, the vulnerability is only exposed to large guests (guests assigned more than of memory).  MITIGATION ==========  Running only PV guests, or only smaller guests will avoid this problem.  Since the vulnerability actually depends on the guest's shadow memory, if you are overriding the default allocation (which is about 0.5% of guest RAM) by using the "shadow_memory=" VM configuration file option, you should adjust your idea of a 'smaller' guest accordingly.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich.  RESOLUTION ==========  For HAP-enabled guests, the attached patch resolves ths issue.  HAP (Hardware Assisted Paging, aka nested paging) is enabled by default if the system is suitably capable.  The VM configuration file can disable or enable HAP explicitly by setting "hap=0" or "hap=1". HAP can also be globally disabled by specifying "hap=off" on the hypervisor command line.  There is no resolution for guests using shadow pagetables (i.e., not using HAP) at this time.  xsa97-hap-unstable.patch                             xen-unstable                                  Xen 4.4.x                                  Xen 4.3.x      Xen 4.2.x  $ xsa97*.patch      xsa97-hap-unstable.patch $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =A/Ph -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment "xsa97-hap-unstable.patch" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
