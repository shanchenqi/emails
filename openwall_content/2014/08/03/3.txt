Hint: ISPs may be subjected to SORM-2 (been there, seen that, no t-shirt this time), Jindun Gongcheng, or other pretty things. Site owners may be interested in tracking their users' activity (that's why I prefer browsing online shops anonymously, without logging in). Other people may try to eavesdrop (or even intercept) connections from users to servers.   > It's not about the users wish. It's about the site's wish.

When people want to make their systems secure, they use client-side certificates. When people want to make their systems public, they normally don't care of who access them and don't track their users.  When a site allows anonymous access, that may be performed via HTTP. Authenticated (over HTTPS) users may (and normally should) work via HTTPS, but forcing all users to use HTTPS is "a VERY bad idea" // (q) Kurt Seifried,   --  Alexey V.
