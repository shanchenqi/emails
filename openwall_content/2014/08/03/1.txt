If you commit to encrypting the entire site then you can do things like:  http://dev.chromium.org/sts http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/net/http/transport_security_state_static.json  So anyone using Chrome will be forced, by their browser, to use HTTPS for cloudsecurityalliance.org for example. I never have to worry about SSL strip, becuase chrome will actually convert anything I type into the address bar from the default http to https, and if I specify http explicitly it will still send the request out as https.  You can also serve HSTS headers for browsers that don't have a whitelist that you can be added to easily (basically all of them other than chrome).  It's not about the users wish. It's about the site's wish. The site is providing the service, the site provides the TOS/AUP/etc. The site may choose optionally to leave it up to the user, but this is a VERY bad idea.   - --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1 Comment: Using GnuPG with Thunderbird - http://www.enigmail.net/  iQIcBAEBAgAGBQJT3ZlbAAoJEBYNRVNeJnmTtEUP+wRQxsSRb7rFcLFaHFqhCiSv =e6lX -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
