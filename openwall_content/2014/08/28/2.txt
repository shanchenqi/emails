There's a very large number of licenses out there that comply with every definition of Free Software or Open Source Software that you'll find in no list whatsoever, mostly slight variations of the various BSD-alike licenses that are only used for a single piece of software.  As for the original matter, I agree that we should go with open source licenses only, however given I know that it can sometimes be hard to decide, I think nobody should blame the list moderators if they decide in doubt to let messages through if they have unclear licensing situation. Because doing the research if something should be considered foss can sometimes be painful and a lot of work.  --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
