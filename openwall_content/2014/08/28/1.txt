My two coppers:  I'd say keep it limited to things that are at least mostly available under an OSI license or a very similar one.  These days there's really not that much open source code out there that doesn't fit that definition, so the edge cases shouldn't come up that often.  When they do come up, just make an "executive decision" as the moderator.  Thanks for asking for opinions on the matter.  tim  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
