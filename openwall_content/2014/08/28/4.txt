[root@tux ~]# rpm -q zarafa-webapp [root@tux ~]#  [root@tux ~]# rpm -ql zarafa-webapp | grep charts.swf | xargs md5sum /usr/share/zarafa-webapp/client/extjs/resources/charts.swf [root@tux ~]#  I don't know how to abuse this but upstream notice "This defect allows JavaScript injection exploits to be created against domains that host these affected .swf files, whether or not the .swf files are embedded in your application." seems to be important enough for this heads up.  Given that Zarafa WebApp 1.6 (final release) happened on there might be distributions/downstreams still shipping Zarafa WebApp 1.5. Zarafa WebApp does not use that file so removing it on packaging level is fine. Fedora is not affected; it doesn't ship Zarafa WebApp.   With kind regards  Robert Scheck --  Fedora Project * Fedora Ambassador * Fedora Mentor * Fedora Packager  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
