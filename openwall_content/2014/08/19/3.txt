Current is Fixed Version: N/A  Vulnerability Details:  Wp Source Control plugin for WordPress contains a flaw that allows traversing outside of a restricted path. The issue is due to the downloadfiles/download.php script not properly sanitizing user input, specifically path traversal style attacks (e.g. '../'). With a specially crafted request, a remote attacker can gain access to arbitrary files, which can be read by web server process.  Root cause:  Unsanitized user input to file_get_contents() function.  Proof-of-concept:  /wp-content/plugins/wp-source-control/downloadfiles/download.php?path=../../../../wp-config.php  Notes:  Vendor contact details unknown.  This vulnerability can be used to get WordPress database address, username and password, which can be used in certain environments to elevate privileges and execute malicious PHP code.  --- Henri Salo  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
