I posted a patch that I think actually addresses the issue but till now no-one cared to comment on it, apply it, or point out what's still wrong, despite the ping 3 weeks later It was - instead of the insufficient Linux ones - in fact meanwhile applied to the Xen clone of that code.   Perhaps the kernel folks want to look at it again if they missed it so far.
