For example, there may be situations in which the blank credentials can only be entered over a trusted interface (for some definition of "trusted" that is consistent with the vendor's security policy and otherwise reasonable for the product's context).  > So an attacker can easily race the admin to the WebGUI, set a new > password  Similarly, "race the admin to the WebGUI" situations don't always qualify for CVE IDs. There are many products in which the full functionality of install.php is available to the first client who visits install.php. A product can have a design constraint that installation must not require the person to have any ability to use a command line (or other non-browser method) for any part of the initial product setup. This design constraint was historically reasonable for some types of shared web hosting, for example.  For this FreeNAS case, the blank password seems unreasonable because    -- the requirement for a reboot implies that the product is not      intended for use in constrained scenarios such as shared web      hosting    -- the web interface exposes a root shell. This is quite different      from a case where use of install.php has a consequence limited to      "the machine ends up with a web application that wasn't supposed      to be there, and maybe some disk consumption or other minor      resource consumption."
