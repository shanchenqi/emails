Be it using packages or "mainstream" installation: https://wiki.icinga.org/display/howtos/Setting+up+Icinga+Web+on+Ubuntu. Such credentials give full access (root access) to the installation.  If Icinga wasn't configured yet, it's not such a drama, but otherwise, it can become rather critical: - -> Access to the whole infrastructure schema - -> Possibility to submit checks which can help to harass a host/service - -> Possibility to disable all the checks around to shut monitoring down - -> Possibility to overload the master host by issuing too many checks (master needs to handle them - MySQL dump, pnp4nagios, perf data analysis, and so on)  On cve-assign@...re.org wrote: > > My understanding is default/blank admin credentials now == CVE > > There isn't a precise rule of this type.
