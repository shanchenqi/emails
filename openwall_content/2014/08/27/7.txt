Simple: If we go with Open Source only then "is the code available under an approved license"?  http://opensource.org/licenses  Obviously if there needs to be an exception (e.g. a closed source/poorly licensed source interacts significantly with something Open Source it might be worth discussing).  The other aspect of this: in my experience the majority of closed source vendors just don't care about security. So discussing it, especially without their input/even being aware of it is quite pointless.  > Alexander  --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
