XRMS Description: ----------------------  The most advanced open source customer relationship management  (CRM), Sales Force Automation (SFA) suite: also features business  intelligence (BI) tools, Computer Telephony Integration (CTI), and  advanced plugin architecture. PHP/ADOdb/LAMP  Brief: -------------------------------  I tried to report this to the developers/get it fixed a month ago,  although I've had no response from the developers. This should work  against latest, was found a long time ago, and I recently found it  while brushing off some hard drives.  Details: ------------------------  We get SQL injection via $_SESSION poisoning which we use to  retrieve admin credentials. We then authenticate with these  credentials and exploit a trivial command injection. Attached is a  working POC.
