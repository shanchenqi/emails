R. Oldham" <cr@...tstack.com> To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: Revised: Salt released  Greetings,  We are pleased to announce the release of Salt. The release notes can be found here:    The sources are available on pypi:   Salt fixes security issues documented by Insecure tmp-file creation in seed.py, salt-ssh, and salt-cloud. Upgrading is recommended.  Special thanks to Kurt Seifried at Red Hat for investigating these issues and bringing them to our attention (and also letting me know that my first post got mangled somehow).  --  C. R.
