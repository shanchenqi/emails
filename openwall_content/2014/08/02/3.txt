HTTPS wouldn't help much: the attackers (most of which are known to use 3-letter names) can (and they really do) issue a fake certificate for their decoy servers.  In general, nothing received from the Net could be trusted. And the HTTPS doesn't guarantee anything beyond "this certificate was signed by this CA" - was that voluntary or forced.  Enforcing HTTPS for the whole site is even more stupid: normally only user-specific data (login procedure, personal settings for registered users, etc) should be forced to go through HTTPS; everything else should normally be left up to the users' wish.  But the terminal state of mental disability is... yes, using scripts from outer sources: intercepting one popular source like https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/*/jquery.min.js will allow the attacker to not bother of intercepting other sites directly.   > This issue was fixed in the git master branch (development branch  > for upcoming v. 2.2) with commit on  Not a vulnerability, not a fix.   --  Alexey V.
