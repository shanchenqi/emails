More background information on this amendment can be found at  Android Platform Release: 04 Aug  Cordova apps can potentially leak data to other apps via URL loading   Severity: Medium  Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation  Versions Affected: Cordova Android versions up to  Description: Android applications built with the Cordova framework can launch other applications through the use of anchor tags, or by redirecting the webview to an Android intent URL. An attacker who can manipulate the HTML content of a Cordova application can create links which open other applications and send arbitrary data to those applications. An attacker who can run arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the Cordova application can also set the document location to such a URL. By using this in concert with a second, vulnerable application, an attacker might be able to use this method to send data from the Cordova application to the network.  The latest release of Cordova Android takes steps to block explicit Android intent urls, so that they can no longer be used to start arbitrary applications on the device.  Implicit intents, including URLs with schemes such as "tel", "geo", and "sms" can still be used to open external applications by default, but this behaviour can be overridden by plugins.  Upgrade path: Developers who are concerned about this should rebuild their applications with Cordova Android  Credit: This issue was discovered by David Kaplan and Roee Hay of IBM Security Systems.
