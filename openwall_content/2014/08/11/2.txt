This in combination with the common pattern           of serving files with Plack::Middleware::Static could allow           an attacker to bypass a whitelist of generated files (avar)  See [2,3] for more details about this issue, which might lead to information disclosure.   [1]  [2]  [3]  Can a CVE be assigned for this isssue (as an example, was previously also assigned for CGI::Application).
