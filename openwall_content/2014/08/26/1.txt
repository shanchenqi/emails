The primary issue seems to be the one mentioned in the comment -- specifically, the code's decision on whether to verify server certificates depends on unusual circumstances that might occur, for example, if HTTPS communication also uses client certificates. This decision process apparently has no relationship to the design objectives of the async-http-client product.  Use for this issue involving an unexpected/improper decision process.  There is no CVE ID for the issue of whether the product should provide a simple way to disable certificate verification, given that enabling certificate verification is the default. The discoverer and vendor disagree about this.   > 2. async-http-client: No SSL HostName verification >  Here, mentions two closely related code problems. Better URLs for these are:       Also, jfarcand, representing the vendor, did an merge for "Fix for -- use a hostname verifier that does hostname verification." Use for this issue.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =9fRx -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
