Thus a corrupted isofs image can possibly have a CL     entry pointing to another CL entry leading to possibly unbounded     recursion in kernel code and thus stack overflow or deadlocks (if there     is a loop created from CL entries).      Fix the problem by not allowing CL entry to point to a directory entry     with CL entry (such use makes no good sense anyway) and by checking     whether CL entry doesn't point to itself.
