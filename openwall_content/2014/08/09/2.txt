The biggest aspect is not new and has been abused for years, which is the main reason why so many large companies physically remove (stick or desolder) USB ports : you're connecting a *device* to your system and there's no way to make that safe using software only. With a bogus driver and a DMA-capable device, you can end up accessing kernel locations and causing a lot more discrete harm such as unlocking displays, changing UIDs of running processes, etc. And that's much harder to detect, especially in closed drivers or with closed systems.  So I'd rather not clobber keyboard drivers for of the users in order to improve safety by a few percent for a few percent of users.  One more efficient solution could be to have a sysctl to disable hotplugging of USB devices, all of them. Software would then detect the new devices, and decide to load the drivers among a whitelist associated to a given port. The administrator could add new rules, and it could be the user for personal desktop PCs. But even then you still have the risk of the user not understanding what's happening and bindly clicking "OK".  Just my 2 cents, Willy   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
