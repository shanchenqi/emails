The correct way to do this is to do:  for bus in /sys/bus/usb/usb*; do   echo 0 > ${bus}/authorized_default done  to disable registration of new USB devices (kernel will still enumerate them, but no driver will handle them).  Echo 1 (or -1) to re-enable registration. Current devices will keep working. If you want to completely disable a bus (including power), use 'authorized' instead of 'authorized_default' sysfs entry.
