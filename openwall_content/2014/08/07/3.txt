PHP + libxml makes it pretty much impossible to parse an XML file safely. The issue was internal entity expansion (quadratic, not exponential). Not XXE and potentially not all that bad depending on server configuration.  Per their security advisory, Drupal submitted a CVE request for this as well. This is actually a vulnerability in an external library ( http://scripts.incutio.com/xmlrpc/). We use the library as-is, while they forked it. (Well, they took the class and broke it into individual functions â the code was the same and our patches differed only in coding standards.) Not sure how this should be handled.

Same reporter, same same line of code, but two separate issues here. One, when building CSRF tokens, the individual pieces were not separated by delimiter, so $action + $user_id could have been post_1 + user 23 or post 12 + user 3. Second issue: Nonces were not being compared in a time-constant manner. Neither are easy to exploit.
