The code added  to check that the server hostname matches the domain name in the  subject's CN field was flawed. This can be exploited by a  Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack where the attacker can spoof a valid  certificate using a specially crafted subject.  Note that Axis 1 is EOL upstream, and the incomplete patch for  was never merged upstream. It was, however, shipped by  various vendors, including Debian and Red Hat. I do not believe Axis 2  is affected.  The incomplete patch:   Is attached to this issue:   The flaw exists in the getCN(String) method. An attacker could craft a  subject that includes a CN in a field other than the CN, and this CN  would be used when validating the hostname.  Since Axis 1 is EOL upstream, I have assigned to this  issue from the Red Hat CNA. I have now made this issue public:   An upstream bug, along with a proposed patch, is available here:   Thanks -- David Jorm / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
