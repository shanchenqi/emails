However, as attacker does not control realm strings for any of the trusted repositories, that would require preimage attack.  The lack of (publicly) known efficient preimage attacks against MD5 should imply such attack is still only theoretical.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
