Depending on how vmstate_xhci_event is placed in the qemu binary, this issue can range from non-issue, infinite loop to (potentially) privilege escalation in case the we end up with fields that have info and/or field_exist members initialized in a way that is useful for exploitation (most probably unlikely).  In the worst case, attacker able to alter the migration data could use this flaw to to corrupt QEMU process memory.
