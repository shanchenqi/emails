An attacker with fortuitous network position could execute code on a local IPython notebook by modifying the mathjax javascript.  This issue was fixed in the git master branch (development branch for upcoming v. 2.2) with commit on   Mitigations: * Run the notebook with SSL (see http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/2/notebook/public_server.html#securing-a-notebook-server ). * Install mathjax     from IPython.external.mathjax import install_mathjax     install_mathjax()  Regards,  Kyle Kelley   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
