On the contrary, it's trivial to do on a whole bunch of USB devices as that is how they were _designed_ to work.  So much so that there is a whole USB spec on exactly how to do this in a way that will work across all different operating systems: 	http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/devclass_docs/DFU_1.1.pdf I don't remember when the 1.0 version of this spec was published, I think around or so.  So I really don't see how this ability is anything "shocking" to anyone.  > That's not to say that the research being discussed hasn't thrown up > some very interesting issues around hardware and trust.  Never trust hardware.  Until you have to.  :)  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
