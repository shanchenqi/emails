That's good to know. Not sure about the least of worries, the  overwriting of firmware seems to be the crux of what people are worried  about, isn't it? But I see your point, we don't need to worry since  you're saying firmware cannot be written unless it's initiated by the  kernel. But a lot of the discussion I've read on this issue seems to  assume that a "clean" USB device can have it's firmware replaced by the  bad guys with malware almost without the OS having a say in the matter.  e.g. USB stick with evil firmware infects USB controller, which in turn  infects other USB sticks subsequently plugged in. Although I've seen  people involved in USB hardware manufacture argue this is nowhere near  as easy as some of the hysteria surrounding this suggests.  But, theoretically, isn't it is possible for device and controller to do  their own thing between each other without the OS knowing anything?  After all, the OS controls the USB controller, but the controller is in  control of the device? Or does the kernel's control extend to the device?
