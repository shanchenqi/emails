That may be good for servers, but almost unusable on worstations: people tend to charge mobile devices while they work.  Personally I'd like to be able to shorten D+ and D- lines for all unused ports and keep them in "charge-only" state. However, that'll require disconnecting them from the socket to get this scheme:  Host                       Device  VCC    ----------------    VCC  D-     ---+        +---    D-           |        | D+     ---+        +---    D+  GND    ----------------    GND  It is possible, but adding even a single component to a system board causes a marketoids' butthurt.   >> Bus Device ID Logitech, Inc.
