Reading that thread, that's exactly what I thought about that. I guess it could be a good idea to set usbcore.authorized_default to 0 when the systems is locked (logind could provide that information). There's still the issue that it's then not possible to unlock the system in some situation (for example because you had to unplug the keyboard while logged out, or stuff like that). But at least that would be a possibility. >  > > In regards to the PCI stuff, don't miss Joe's talk at DEFCON on Sunday. > >  > > > >  > > People have much more exposed PCI on their laptops and servers than they > > realize.

I lost track of the current OSX status, but I had the impression that they would only enable Vt-d (where present) when the systems was locked, not always.  Note that on Linux, you can boot intel_iommu=on (or force it at compile time). I do that since a long time now (actually since I myself found bugs in network cards firmwares which I then used to bounce to the host, that raised my own paranoĂŻa quite a lot). I also discovered that I/OMMU (like any firmware) can be buggy too (for example on my ironlake system I need intel_iommu=on,igfx_off for it to work), but it's apparently better on more recent Intel systems.
