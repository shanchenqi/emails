By default you get a text based menu with some options (setup network/DNS/etc.), and one option is "Reset WebGUI Login Credentials".  The problem is at first boot (and if you ever pick "Reset WebGUI Login Credentials") the web admin has a blank password, anyone that can access it can set the admin password and then use the web GUI to fire up a root shell (there's a nice little web shell command line).  So an attacker can easily race the admin to the WebGUI, set a new password, login as root, setup a backdoor, then reset the WebGUI password so it's blank again and the admin would be none the wiser (log files won't help because the attacker has root can can easily sanitize them).  There is no way from the text GUI to set the Web GUI admin password. I don't think there is even a CLI tool to set the web GUI password (I can't find it easily).  Either way, does this deserve a CVE? Forcing a user to set the admin Web GUI password through the Web GUI, meaning it must be exposed to some degree prior to securing it. My understanding is default/blank admin credentials now == CVE.
