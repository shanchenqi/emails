I haven't looked at the actual code, but Adam Langley said this on another mailing list:  ---------- Forwarded message ---------- From: Adam Langley <agl@...gle.com> Date: Thu, Oct 16, at AM Subject: Re: NTP vs. HSTS To: Anne van Kesteren <annevk@...evk.nl> Cc: John Kemp <john@...mp.net>, "public-webappsec@...org" <public-webappsec@...org>   On Thu, Oct 16, at AM, Anne van Kesteren <annevk@...evk.nl> wrote: > On Thu, Oct 16, at PM, John Kemp <john@...mp.net> wrote: >> > > So the problem is that time synchronization does not happen over TLS. > That seems like a pretty big flaw in OSs. Hopefully someone audits any > other unauthenticated channels they may have.  This is the motivation for things like tlsdate (https://github.com/ioerror/tlsdate) as used in parts of ChromeOS.  However, in section seven, where the author claims that preloaded entries are added for days, that's only via the net-internals debugging interface. (The code screenshot shown is also of code for that debugging interface.) I believe that preloaded entries in Chrome will always be enforced, no matter what the system time is.
