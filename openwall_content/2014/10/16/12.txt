The reason: HSTS preloaded sites are handled exactly the same way as normal HSTS sites - they can expire. Chrome sets a maximum timeout for HSTS of days for preloaded sites. That was elaborated in the talk today. He demonstrated the attack on google mail which is in this whitelist. Set clock 3 years into the future and youre done.  It could be argued that it is wrong to expire preloaded HSTS sites. But the very same attack applies to HPKP which basically has to expire, because you don't want to use keys forever.  --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
