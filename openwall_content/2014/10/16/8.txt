The obvious solution being to whitelist your site (in the chrome/firefox source code)if you truly care:  email agm@...omium.org asking to be added to the whitelist, from the domain you want white listed (otherwise they tend to ignore it). Usually within a few business days they'll add it to the source code, and then in the next browser update they will update the list and you will now be white listed.  https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/chromium/+/trunk/net/http/transport_security_state_static.json  I've done this for my domains, you should too!  --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
