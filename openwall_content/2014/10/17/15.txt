Sure, I read up on this a while ago, but wasn't sure if it was catching on.  Thanks for the update.   > You're ignoring the attack vectors against DNSSEC.  Yes, true, but this is no different than the current situation with TLS.  Why bother subverting DNSSEC in order to remove HSTS-like controls, and then downgrade from HTTPS->HTTP in order to get at the traffic, when you can just get at the TLS traffic directly by subverting that PKI?  In order to address the nation-state scenario, I think we need the ability to apply multiple signatures to the same server key.  If a CA in Israel and a CA in Iran both signed the same key, what are the chances of collusion?  One way to achieve multiple signatures would be to leverage DNSSEC and stuff fingerprints in signed DNS records, leveraging two separate PKIs for the same TLS keys.  I'd be interested to know if you know of any attempts to do this already.  cheers, tim  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
