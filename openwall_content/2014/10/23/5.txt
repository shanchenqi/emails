The already-bad value of 'bytes' is assigned to 'sec->size' few lines before the crash, so perhaps there would be potential for exploitability later down the line; but the code ends up crashing soon thereafter in a 'while (bytes > 0)' loop that has no other exit conditions. That loop would need to go over the entire address space without SEGV to avoid the crash.  /mz  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
