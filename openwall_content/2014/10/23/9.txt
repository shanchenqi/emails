Zarafa has been already notified.  [root@tux ~]# rpm -q zarafa-webaccess [root@tux ~]#   [root@tux ~]# rpm -ql zarafa-webaccess | grep swfupload.swf | xargs md5sum /usr/share/zarafa-webaccess/client/widgets/swfupload/swfupload.swf [root@tux ~]#   Given that some distributions/downstreams are shipping that vulnerable .swf file this is just meant as a simple "heads up". There are two solutions:  a) Replace the bundled swfupload.swf by the fork maintained by WordPress    from https://github.com/wordpress/secure-swfupload (upstream will likely    do the same for a future release of Zarafa) or b) Remove the vulnerable SWFUpload e.g. at packaging time (this is what I    did for Fedora because I never managed it to build the .swf file from    source code to satisfy our Fedora Packaging Guidelines). Copy & paste    example from .spec file for removal:  --- snipp --- %if 0%{?no_multiupload} sed $RPM_BUILD_ROOT%{_sysconfdir}/%{name}/webaccess/config.php > \     $RPM_BUILD_ROOT%{_sysconfdir}/%{name}/webaccess/config.php.new touch -c -r $RPM_BUILD_ROOT%{_sysconfdir}/%{name}/webaccess/config.php{,.new} mv -f $RPM_BUILD_ROOT%{_sysconfdir}/%{name}/webaccess/config.php{.new,} rm -rf $RPM_BUILD_ROOT%{_datadir}/%{name}-webaccess/client/widgets/swfupload/ %endif --- snapp ---   With kind regards  Robert Scheck --  Fedora Project * Fedora Ambassador * Fedora Mentor * Fedora Packager  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
