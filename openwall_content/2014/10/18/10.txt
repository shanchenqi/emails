Use  This is within the scope of CVE because TYPO3 has published a Security Bulletin indicating that it's a vulnerability from their perspective. The Credits section says "Credits go to Georg Ringer who discovered and reported the issue and Armin Vieweg who quickly responded & resolved this issue," where Armin Vieweg is apparently the author of the extension:    http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/dce    Last upload comment: Changed new option disableUpdateCheck to   enableUpdateCheck and disables it by default.    Author: Armin Ruediger Vieweg  This might imply a security policy of "'installation environment data is ... reported to the infrastructure of the extension author' was intentional behavior, and can remain the intentional behavior of an apparently useful update feature; however, it must not be the default."  Documentation/PrivacyPolicy/Index.rst has:    The backend module of DCE may contain an image which is located on my   server. It shows the user if there is a new DCE version available.    It passes:    - the TYPO3 version   - the DCE version   - and the backend language    Based on these informations I'm able to say: "Yes, a new version is   available, but not for your TYPO3 version.". These values are passed   completely anonymously and help me to improve the extension.    Because I have the data I am also able to get statistics. Like: Which   TYPO3 version is used most often? I'm going to publish some   interesting graphs based on these data on the `Facebook page`_ of DCE   extension.  with Resources/Private/Templates/DceModule/Index.html rendering the following in the (currently) non-default configuration:    <a href="http://dce.v.ieweg.de/versioncheck/update" target="_blank">   <img src="http://dce.v.ieweg.de/versioncheck?t3=   {dce:be.currentTypo3Version()}&amp;dce={dce:be.currentDceVersion()}&amp;l={dce:be.currentLanguage()}"   alt="" /></a>  As always, a vendor is allowed to announce this type of previously default intentional behavior as a vulnerability; it's just somewhat unusual to do so.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =qsCz -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
