I hear this "we need to fix TLS/HTTPS with DNSSEC" a lot.  There are a couple of difficulties with that: 1. DNSSEC is currently mostly vapoware. At least since the kaminsky DNS attacks I'm hearing "DNSSEC is coming". The reality is: it's not. Adoption is very rare today. This may change, but I don't see anyone rushing to DNSSEC. 2. Even if DNSSEC would work: How exactly do you want a browser to check dnssec records? Should it have its own dns server? Because right now the usual setup is: * Provider runs DNS server * (sometimes) router is running a DNS server which is basically   forwarding requests to the provider DNS * Client has no own DNS, just queries router or provider DNS  Basically, the current situation doesn't really consider having DNSSEC verified on the client. This could of course be fixed by either having a local DNS resolver running or having the browsers ship their own DNS resolver. However that's a rather huge change and it will likely have some other implications (portal pages come to mind) - and I don't see anybody working on this.  That said: I wouldn't entirely throw the idea away of using dnssec to increase tls security. But it's not something we can do today or any time soon.  --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
