Other perspectives may exist. The two main options for handling this type of situation are:  1. The vendor fix can be mapped to either by just stating that the associated vulnerability is or by describing the fix as a workaround or something similar.  2. If the vendor feels that ror-e.com ror_ecommerce itself is responsible for the successful password-reset attack (i.e., the vendor considers the lack of to_s to be a security-relevant implementation mistake, regardless of any opinions about what Ruby on Rails could or should be doing), then the vendor can have a CVE ID specific to the ror_ecommerce product.  For option 2, it's not required that the vendor send e-mail here. We'll accept reasonable efforts at passing along what's been heard from the vendor. Right now, however, the available vendor statement is "add to_s just in case," and this isn't quite enough for us to conclude that the vendor wants to accept option 2.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =jvA3 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
