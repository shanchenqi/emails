A brief investigation and no panic, it's the perl-Razor-Agent, which on RHEL/Fedora is supposed to log to /var/log/razor-agent.log but doesn't due to some HOME shenanigans:   This log file grows slowly, basically one entry per day/reboot:  Oct 12 [ 2] [bootup] Logging initiated LogDebugLevel=3 to file:razor-agent.log  but it won't ever get logrotated, and on a system with a very tight /, e.g. a cloud system maybe using immutable images that only have a few spare k on / (and /var/log/ on another partition or whatever) this could be an issue.  I'm inclined to not call this a DoS as even over a year it'll only be a few tens of kb, and it doesn't appear that the attacker can trigger faster growth, but I can see situations where this could be a problem.   --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
