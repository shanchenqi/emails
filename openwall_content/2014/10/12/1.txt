E.g. sometimes it's easy: like one week after the MariaDB fork from MySQL it's obvious that any flaw affecting one will affect the other and they're basically the same code, but as time goes on MariaDB is diverging. One thing that would be hugely useful here to solve the CVE MERGE problem, and to let people know what related software packages they should look at would be a database of code considered "equivalent" by Mitre for the purposes of CVE MERGE and also for people to check if other things are affected by the same flaw.  I suspect there aren't actually that many entries, and populating it as they come up would be pretty simple, especially if there's an easy way to submit entries (just send an email?).  Would this be something Mitre can do perhaps?  --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
