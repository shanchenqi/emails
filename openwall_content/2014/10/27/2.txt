Sorry, not researched.  objdump-elf-crasher looks like a stack exhaustion with /usr/bin/strings, so probably not a big deal.  objdump-pe-crasher doesn't affect strings, but if you do run objdump -x, it looks like an attempt to do fprintf() with a bogus pointer, called from pe_print_edata(). Specifically, there's a line that goes like this:    fprintf (file,            " %s\n", data + edt.name - adj);  ...and edt.name, looks like, comes from:    edt.name           = bfd_get_32 (abfd, data + 12);  ...and the value is completely off-charts. So, probably another instance of essentially no range checking, although this particular crash may be not exploitable at a very quick glance, unless something interesting happened beforehand.  /mz  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
