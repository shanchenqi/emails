Sure, but at least with Haskell (and the like) you have to make it very explicit that this is what you want to do. A lot of our problems seem to come from the mixing happening by accident.  > But mixing code with data is probably an *overused* approach, > given the risks that come with it.  Right. Which is why it should be a little more work to do and require that it be made explicit that the mixing is what is intended.  > We need to help developers know what is safe, and what is less safe. > Then they can avoid easily-avoided problems, and know when they have > extra work to do.  Educating developers will be equally hard as switching to safer languages but at least it is something people will stomache getting started on.  --  Tracy Reed, RHCE     Digital signature attached for your safety.
