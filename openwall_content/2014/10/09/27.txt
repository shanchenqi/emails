Not in this case.  A Haskell implementation of the POSIX "sh" specification, that then added function imports, could have made the same mistake just as easily.  > Educating developers will be equally hard as switching to safer languages but > at least it is something people will stomache getting started on.  I'm all for switching to safer languages where it makes sense; many problems are completely prevented by them.  Heartbleed, for example, would have been prevented in almost all languages *except* C and C++, as I have already publicly noted here:  http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/heartbleed.html#safe-language  But let's not oversell the tools.  Shellshock was the running of data as a command in program whose *purpose* was to be a command interpreter. A rewritten Haskell version (for example) could do it just as easily.  Also, I think you're underestimating the cost of language switching. It is a *big* deal to switch languages in an existing code base. Educating developers is less risky, way faster, and costs less too.  --- David A.
