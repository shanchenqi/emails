If so, could that harm anything?  It is obviously much better if the communication does not use shared resources (like the environment). But this is all logical - in the end all of this is in the same memory. The goal is to maximize the separation enough so that attackers cannot misuse it.  The better the separation, the less risk later.    --- David A.Wheeler  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
