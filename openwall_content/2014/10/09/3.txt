The current namespace change is one option, obviously,  But that's not really separating code and data, right? It doesn't feel like it follows the spirit of this phrasing:  "When an existing construct in a system is widely expected to be used for storing data, avoid overloading it for use of storing code."  ...because it very much overloads the syntax to store code alongside with the data, in a way that theoretically shouldn't but in practice may collide. It's not a whole lot better than the "separation" of CSS and JS in HTML, in the sense that both of them are sort of guarded by delineated by specific syntax structures.  > 1) A single dedicated environment variable for all function exports. > e.g.:  Ditto?  > 2) A bash-specific file handle.

What if control passes through an intermediate program that isn't bash?
