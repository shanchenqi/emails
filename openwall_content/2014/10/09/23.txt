Due to the way that Linux handles filesystem business, it is unlikely to work on filesystems that have anything open for writing.  (It works on my Fedora system targetting /dev.)  The upshot is that it may be difficult to exploit in any meaningful way on some systems.  It may also work more reliably against network filesystems.  I'm not really sure.  That output means that you're vulnerable.  You would have gotten something like "Permission denied" if you weren't vulnerable.  --Andy  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
