That's not right, a french trader went to jail for taking to high risks and loosing some billions at the market:   (okay it turns out he did get out, but needs to wear some electronic tag still).  Also:  Even if you would be right and there would be no rules in the financial sector I would argue that this is no counter argument at all to not make new rules. I would argue those rules should also applie to financial sectors as well.  kind regards  Sven -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v2  =ch9P -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
