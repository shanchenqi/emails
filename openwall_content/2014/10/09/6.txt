Well, I just honestly don't understand how adding the prefix to environment variable fits in the mold of the rule you cite ("When an existing construct in a system is widely expected to be used for storing data, avoid overloading it for use of storing code"). It strikes me as the epitome of overloaded, in-band transmission of code alongside with data - pretty close to the menace of HTML + JS, just done in a slightly smarter way.  If what Florian has implemented embodies the spirit of the rule we're preaching here, I'm all for it, but not sure if most developers would interpret it this way. A natural interpretation would be, "don't put functions in the environment", which is fine, except that there aren't many other places to put them if you really want to implement exports in the first place.  /mz  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
