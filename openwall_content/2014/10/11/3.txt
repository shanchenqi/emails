A difference in the product name does not always require a separate CVE.  In this case, is noted as similar to is a frequently seen type of mistake (width * height leads to integer overflow) and it's entirely plausible that this mistake would occur independently in different codebases that have related purposes.  Use for   Also, is noted as similar to is a frequently seen type of mistake: essentially, there's a number that can be sent in a manner compatible with a protocol specification, and the number might even be sensible in an environment with huge resources, but the number is used for a malloc argument without checking whether malloc succeeds. (In other words, it's not necessarily worthwhile to validate the number before calling malloc.) It's entirely plausible that this mistake would occur independently in different codebases that have related purposes.  Use for   MITRE didn't try to find the specific vulnerable TigerVNC code in an attempt to prove that that code wasn't a derivative of LibVNCServer. We happened to notice a piece of code that may or may not be related to and decided that it didn't look like a derivative. Specifically:         xim->data = (char*)malloc(xim->bytes_per_line * xim->height);     if (!xim->data)       throw rfb::Exception(_("Not enough memory for framebuffer"));  looks different from:     - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =5TIi -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
