This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier  Versions Affected:  >= Not affected:       <= Fixed Versions:      Impact ------ Specially crafted requests can be used to determine whether a file exists on the filesystem that is outside the Rails application's root directory.  The files will not be served, but attackers can determine whether or not the file exists.  This only impacts Rails applications that enable static file serving at runtime.  For example, the application's production configuration will say:    config.serve_static_assets = true  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the work arounds immediately.  Releases  --------  The & releases are available at the normal locations.   Workarounds  -----------  To work around this issue, set config.serve_static_assets = false in an initializer.  This work around will not be possible in all hosting environments and upgrading is advised.  Patches  -------  To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series.  They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.   * 3-1-sec-static-files.patch - Patch for the 3.1.x release series * 3-2-sec-static-files.patch - Patch for the 3.2.x release series * 4-0-sec-static-files.patch - Patch for the 4.0.x release series * 4-1-sec-static-files.patch - Patch for the 4.1.x release series  Please note that only the 3.2.x, 4.0.x & 4.1.x  series are supported at present.  Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.  Credits  -------   This vulnerability was reported by multiple researchers working independently.  Thanks to each of them for reporting the issue to us and verifying the fixes.  * Eaden McKee * Dennis Hackethal & Christian Hansen of Crowdcurity * Juan C.
