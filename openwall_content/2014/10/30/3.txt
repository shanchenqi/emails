May not be Apache-specfic, but as it's the most popular server out  there...  What is it trying to do?  I've never seen it in my logs before.  - - "GET HTTP/1.1" "-" "Python-urllib/2.6"  The perp (or rather, the 0wn3d box) is somewhere in China.  When decoded, it comes out as  GET ?redirect:${#w=#context.get('com.opensymphony.xwork2.dispatcher.HttpServletResponse').getWriter(),#w.println('[/ok-helo.wang]'),#w.flush(),#w.close()}  but I'm none the wiser.  --  Dave Horsfall (VK2KFU)  "Bliss is a MacBook with a FreeBSD server." http://www.horsfall.org/spam.html (and check the home page whilst you're there)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
