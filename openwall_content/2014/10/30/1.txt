Possibly. I've been having my posts to the list dropped for many months, unable to get ahold of anyone who could fix or diagnose the problem. I eventually figured out that cross-posting to BUGTRAQ and F-D causes the posts to end up in their spam folder. If that's true for everybody, that's hilarious.  But even if I don't cross-post, it usually takes 3+ days for things to go through, and the number of bounces you get in response is the worst I've ever seen on the list.  /mz  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
