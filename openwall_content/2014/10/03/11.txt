Wheeler" <dwheeler@...eeler.com> To: "oss-security" <oss-security@...ts.openwall.com> Subject: Shellshock timeline (was: remote code execution  through bash)  FYI, I've created a timeline of major Shellshock events here:    http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/shellshock.html#timeline  If anyone has corrections or key additions, let me know.  I hope to eventually document "how to detect or prevent something like it in the future" as part of the same paper, but that is unfortunately a harder task :-(.  --- David A.
