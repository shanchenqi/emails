What about the DoS impact claimed here, though? -    sysklogd  ~~~~~~~~  A segfault seems possible in sysklogd if a negative facility value (due to  integer overrun in facility parsing) is used. This could be used to  carry out a remote DoS.  If this can be used to crash syslogd, it's "real security impact", even if rather limited.  Have you tried triggering this condition (getting syslogd to crash)?
