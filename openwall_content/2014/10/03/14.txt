[...]  About the discovery.  I discovered it in the morning (UK) of and reported it at Fri, 12 Sep to Chet, and the security contacts of Debian, Red Hat, Ubuntu and Mandriva (SUSE added later) including details of the bug and the SSH and HTTP (Apache header) vectors and mitigation and a bit fat warning that it was very serious and not to be disclosed.  First patch by Chet at but was easily bypassed. Ensued a discussion on that original list, several patch iterations, whether or not to harden at this point and how, whether or not to output error messages on parsing error, additional vectors, scope, detection methods (IDS...), other affected shells, local privilege escalation?, whether localisation can bypass the fix, the impact of two env vars with the same name, backward compatibility, who to contact early... Of course, I have no visibility of what was discussed internally at Red Hat/Ubuntu/Mandriva...  I suggested the name "bashdoor" on that list on Sun, 14 Sep  A release schedule with public disclosure on the 24th at UTC and early notification to other unix and linux vendors on the 22nd and select infrastructure provider notification (such as CDNs including Microsoft) on the 23rd proposed on the 16th by Florian.  Chet had patches for the final (before disclosure) fix for the current and all past versions of bash up to 3.0 by  (from diff dates)  I was out of the loop after the 19th  bashdoor.com was registered (not by me) with a creation date of UTC sometime before according to whois. Florian also said here that someone brought the early notification sent to vendors/infrastructure to the press, so someone obviously intended to take it to the press. I don't know whom.  To answer the other post. The feature was definitely not in nor (the source of which can be found on the web), but was in Chet confirmed (to me and news outlets) that it was added in  Cheers, Stephane   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
