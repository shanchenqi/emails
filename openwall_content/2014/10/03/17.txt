We have multiple release lines to which the fixes have to be released simultaneously, and overall this overhead is significant. That's why we did one massive release that contains all the fixes.  Wrt a week ago we got a report from somebody that he did a security scan and found that we are still using a vulnerable version of the library to which is assigned. In this release we use a newer version of the library that addresses the problem, and I thought it'd be appropriate to raise a flag to the users that if they continue to use older versions, they'd remain vulnerable to That's why it's in the advisory. It is not because we sat on a report for more than a year.  When you say the timeframe is especially concerning, perhaps you mean you are concerned that we fail to notice this vulnerability in our library for more than a year, and if so, you are of course right. Jenkins project has gotten a long list of library dependencies, and I haven't found any practical means to get notified when vulnerabilities are found in any one of them.
