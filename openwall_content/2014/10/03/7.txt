So, that overflow vector doesn't exist in sysklogd (which never adapted rsyslog's first fix). At most you get a facility of while f_pmask has size 25, ergo OOB access.  I have done enough testing that I am relatively confident no security impact exists other than the aforementioned message-processing issues which would apply to the would-be attacker's own message. That said, applying the fix eliminates all doubt.    --mancha  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
