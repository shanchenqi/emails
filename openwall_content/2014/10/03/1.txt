Many thanks to Rainer Gerhards, rsyslog project lead, for identifying a problem with how rsyslog's rsyslogd and sysklogd's syslogd check for invalid priority values For details please refer to Rainer's well-written issue description. [1]  In sysklogd's syslogd, invalid priority values between and (directly or arrived at via overflow wraparound) can propagate through code causing out-of-bounds access to the f_pmask array within the 'filed' structure by up to bytes past its end. Though most likely insufficient to reach unallocated memory because there are around bytes past f_pmask in 'filed' (mod packing and other differences), incorrect access of fields at higher positions of the 'filed' structure definition can cause unexpected behavior including message mis-classification, forwarding issues, message loss, or other.  I've been unable to contact sysklogd's maintainer (the project is no longer active) but, given some vendors ship sysklogd as their system logging daemon, it was important to share a fix.  Fix for sysklogd 1.5 is available at:  Note: publication of this patch was intentionally delayed to afford the rsyslog project time to correct their initial fix set which was vulnerable to integer overflows [2]  --mancha  === [1] http://www.rsyslog.com/remote-syslog-pri-vulnerability/ [2]  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
