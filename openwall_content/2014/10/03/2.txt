This looks to be related to ("here document" http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/here-docs.html) but the correction is in make_cmd.c Is this a new vulnerability?

No specific patch yet.  > * - command injection RCE found by me. No specific patch yet.  But Florian's unofficial patch or its upstream version & co)  mitigates *ALL* these six so far known CVE, right?
