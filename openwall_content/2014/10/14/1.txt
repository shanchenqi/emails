This means that a potential attacker can be able to execute evil JavaScript/HTML code only within its own session, not affecting the security of other Joomla! users or website visitors. Even though the same "issue" might be exploited as a reflected XSS vulnerability, in my view it still cannot be considered a security threat because, in order to do that, the attacker needs to know the session token of the victim user, since the ContactControllerContact::submit() method calls the JSession::checkToken() method [5] to prevent cross-site request forgeries (CSRF).  Please let me know if you believe I'm wrong or I'm missing something. Thank you.
