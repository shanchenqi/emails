Indeed, Solar, input appreciated.  *all* the bash patches, including the latest ones released on Oct. 05, in this particular instance < http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-4.3-patches/ >) are included in a:  git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/bash.git  And then proceeding to build bash locally...  >> Thus agreeing with Sona:  > This shows the widespread confusion.  There is no more confusion.
