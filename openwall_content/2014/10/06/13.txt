The patch set I mentioned (here on list and in the advisory) contains patches for versions we will never touch.   > * even if is vulnerable and always will be, a downstream vendor >   like Debian or Red Hat might release a derived version like >   which incorporates the recommended patch from the >   upstream project, or a patch from the vendor or a third party, and so >   is not vulnerable > > same here  Yeah, so to solve the obviously vague wording:  - is not vulnerable, all previous v7 are. - is not vulnerable, all previous v8 are. - all older ("totally dead") versions are vulnerable to the extend as described in the advisory and patches as linked to in the advisory can be used to solve the issue for some of these versions. - for v7 and v8 no specific patch files exist because we have released new stable versions. Nobody should ever use an old stable version, because the difference to the current stable is missing bugfixes.
