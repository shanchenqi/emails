Then, some naive question: are we sure that OpenSSL as shipped in distributions is tested against such regressions (if such test actually exists)? It's indeed something that a compiler might break (be it due to a bug or due to an optimization). He might be using OpenSSL as shipped in his distribution. This would be quite damaging.  Reproducibility in behavior is kinda critical here to make sure we're always cryptosecure.
