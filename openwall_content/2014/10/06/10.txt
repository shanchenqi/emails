Getmail introduced support for secure mail retrieval (IMAP4-over-SSL and POP3-over-SSL). However, it lacked certificate verification which rendered SSL/TLS transport entirely vulnerable to MITM attacks. [*]  Getmail added IMAP4-over-SSL certificate verification against trusted root stores and/or digests. However, it lacked certificate hostname validation such that adversaries in possesion of arbitrary certificates signed by trusted root certificates could still level MITM attacks. POP3-over-SSL remained vulnerable to MITM attacks. [*]  Getmail added IMAP4-over-SSL certificate hostname validation. POP3-over-SSL remained vulnerable to MITM attacks. [*]  Getmail added POP3-over-SSL certificate verification against trusted root stores and/or digests as well as certificate hostname validation. [*]  Please allocate CVE ID(s) for the above issues, as needed.  Thanks.  --mancha  [*] http://pyropus.ca/software/getmail/CHANGELOG  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
