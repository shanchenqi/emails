I doubt that (or more realistically, I hope it's not true).  Even the  edition of “Practical UNIX and Internet Security” mentions that you  have to reset IFS as well (a significant omission if “at” does something  even if it hasn't received any parameters).  The authors also point out  that putenv and setenv may only replace the first occurrence of an  environment variable in the environ array, while the system shell could  well pick up the last occurrence.  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
