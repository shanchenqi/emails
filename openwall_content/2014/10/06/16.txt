If so, then we will assign another CVE ID.  The ssh_execute method is indeed prone to password leak if: - passwords are used on the command line - execution fail - calling code catch and log the exception  So far investigations shows that ssh_execute usage does not contain any passwords but we can't guarantee Cinder and Nova releases are not affected as the vulnerable code is still there so it may be safer to considered these releases affected.
