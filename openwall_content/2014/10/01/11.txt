Normally, we just unsubscribe people who happen to ask for that in an attempted posting (instead of unsubscribing themselves via the list robot), and then we reject messages like the above.  There are not a lot of requests like this, but it does happen once in a while.  However, let me use this opportunity to inform any others wishing to unsubscribe that we have instructions on doing so here:  http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security/unsubscribe  And in case anyone reads this in the list archives on the web and wants to subscribe, those instructions are here:  http://oss-security.openwall.org/subscribe  Actually, we simply run ezmlm-idx, so its usual commands work, and instructions are also included in the "welcome" message that the list sends when one subscribes.  The web pages above are just extras.  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
