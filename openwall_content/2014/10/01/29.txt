Another kernel bug which did not get a CVE yet, but should be considered to get one (sorry for the late notification):   Basically it allows a local user to corrupt a xfs filesystem by just creating directories. Depending on whether it is the root filesystem or not the kernel panics or just oopses and forcefully disconnects the filesystem.  The commit states that xfs_repair repairs the filesystem but IIRC further access to that directory would still cause the kernel to either oops or panic. So xfs_repair could not correctly fix the filesystem in all situations. But I am not sure anymore and didn't follow up on this (I had a relocation coming up).  My initial report here:  Reproducer:  Thanks, Hannes  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
