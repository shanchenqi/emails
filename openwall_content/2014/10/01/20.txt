I keep arguing and try to talk to managers that they need to become more active in Open Source, as they would also benefit in terms of less downtime, and better vulnerability management. Having a good Open Source strategy helps IT managers have better control of their IT infrastructure. On top of training IT staff, maybe it's a good time to introduce the idea of "Strong Open Source rating", and committing 10% of their IT employees working hours to improve relevant Open Source projects.  --  This message is strictly personal and the opinions expressed do not represent those of my employers, either past or present.
