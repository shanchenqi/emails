ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The MSR range specified for APIC use in the x2APIC access model spans MSRs. Hypervisor code emulating read and write accesses to these MSRs erroneously covered MSRs. While the write emulation path is written such that accesses to the extra MSRs would not have any bad effect (they end up being no-ops), the read path would (attempt to) access memory beyond the single page set up for APIC emulation.  IMPACT ======  A buggy or malicious HVM guest can crash the host or read data relating to other guests or the hypervisor itself.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen 4.1 and onward are vulnerable.  Only x86 systems are vulnerable.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only PV guests will avoid this vulnerability.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered Jan Beulich at SUSE.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.         xen-unstable, Xen 4.4.x, Xen 4.3.x, Xen 4.2.x  $  $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =m0tK -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
