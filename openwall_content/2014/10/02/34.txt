If an authenticated user places an instance into rescue, and then issues a suspend command it will cause the instance to enter an ERROR state. Nova does not clean up an instance in this state correctly upon deletion. An attacker can use this to launch a denial of service attack. Only setups using the Nova VMware driver are affected by this flaw.  Juno (development branch) fix:  Icehouse fix:  Notes: This fix will be included in the Juno release and in the upcoming release.
