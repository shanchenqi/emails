No specific patch yet.  According to shellshock  test (https://shellshocker.net/shellshock_test.sh)  Florian's patch (Gnu patch  and all other GNU patches ,    & ) seems to have solved all so far known shellshock   vulnerabilities.    root@...uarm:~# ./shellshock_test.sh (original shellshock): not vulnerable bash: shellshocker: command not found (Florian's patch): not vulnerable (taviso bug): not vulnerable (exploit 3 on http://shellshocker.net/): not vulnerable (redir_stack bug): not vulnerable (nested loops off by one): not vulnerable  I guess in the "shellshock_test.sh" should be right?
