The reasons for this, and a good test case to check if you're covered, are discussed here:   If you want to learn a bit more about what these test cases are doing and why it matters, I have an earlier post here:   ...and last but not least, the details for the last two bugs are here:   /mz  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
