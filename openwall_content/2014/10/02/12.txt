Oh, I think Michal's > latest already got a CVE too?  Does this once again render the > (previously) exposed parser not CVE-worthy? ;-(  Whoa :-) So to be clear, I felt that it makes sense to ask for CVEs and report these externally because up until that point, we had no conclusive evidence that the original patch is truly inadequate, and that Florian's patch is anything more than a nice-to-have that several people on oss-security are fond of. Tavis' EOL find was troubling, but fixed upstream with a one-liner in not with Florian's patch.  (In fact, Florian's patch wasn't upstreamed when I started fuzzing the parser and hit the bugs.)  Anyway, I think that the confusion stemmed mostly from fairly inaccurate "vanity" pages, news articles, and "vulnerability checkers" that pulled off stuff like this (https://shellshocker.net/shellshock_test.sh):  -- snip! -- # -c 'true <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF' 2>/dev/null || echo "vulnerable") | grep 'vulnerable' | wc -l)  echo -n (redir_stack bug): " if [ -gt 0 ]; then         echo -e else         echo -e fi -- snip! --  Assigning CVEs + maximum CVSS scores to the two probably non-risk one-off bugs probably didn't help.  At this point, it definitely makes no sense to keep assigning CVEs to additional prefix-requiring problems in the parser at this point, since hopefully everybody got the message to upgrade.  /mz  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
