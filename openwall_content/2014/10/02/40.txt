Although we don't   believe any of the issues you reported could lead to a privilege   escalation (as some of the resulting bugreports suggest), we consider them   to be security issues. Currently, there are two pull requests open [1] [2] potentionally fixing   all mentioned issues. We're waiting for peer review from the other   developers and possibly yours, too.  Cheers, Martin  [1] [2]  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
