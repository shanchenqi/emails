Our understanding from is that "the prtsc key is not disabled when the screen is locked" is intentional behavior. Thus, that's not the root cause. It might be reasonable to argue that, as a consequence, anyone with physical access to that key is implicitly allowed to consume memory and disk space. In many environments, anyone with physical access to that key also happens to be able to turn off the computer.  There could be a CVE assignment for - "for that short period of time those windows are not only shown (which is a bad enough privacy issue on it's own), but also accept input (which makes the already-bad issue even worse)." However, the bug discussion doesn't suggest that there's a reasonable way to solve this within gnome-shell itself. In other words, gnome-shell doesn't have any direct or immediate ability to control the screen when it's not running.  Possibly we're left with the following, which is unusual for a CVE but still valid: "PrtSc is an unauthenticated request that's available to untrusted parties. It's also a very expensive request. The combination of this PrtSc behavior and the existence of the oom-killer allows authentication bypass for command execution. Therefore, PrtSc must be rate limited, and the lack of rate limiting is a vulnerability." Unless there's a better alternative, the CVE ID will be assigned for that vulnerability characterization.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =QrXH -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
