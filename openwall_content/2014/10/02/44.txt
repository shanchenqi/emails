When a job that includes the executable calling tm_adopt() exits, the adopted processes are killed along with the job processes during normal job cleanup. This can enable a non-root user to kill processes he/she doesn't own including root-owned ones on any node in a job.  The issue has been fixed in the following commit numbers for the listed TORQUE Resource Manager versions:  4.2-dev  4.5-dev  5.0-dev  develop  -- Chad Vizino Adaptive Computing   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
