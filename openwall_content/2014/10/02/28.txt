There are no CVEs assigned for general hardening (e.g., Florian's patch) and the ordering of CVE IDs isn't necessarily chronological (because larger vendors get their own ranges to allocate without consulting any central authority).  In true chronological order, it went like this:  * - original RCE found by Stephane. Fixed by and corresponding Sep 24 entries for other versions.  * - file creation / token consumption bug found by Tavis. Fixed by & co (Sep 26)  * - a probably no-sec-risk 10+ here-doc crash found by Florian and Todd. Fixed by & co (Oct 1).  * - a non-crashing, probably no-sec-risk off-by-one found by Florian.  Fixed by & co (Oct 1).  * - uninitialized memory issue, almost certainly RCE found by me. No specific patch yet.  * - command injection RCE found by me. No specific patch yet.  *All* of these are mitigated by Florian's unofficial patch or its upstream version & co, released on Sep 27). If you have that patch, there's no point in obsessing about the status of individual bugs, because they should no longer pose a security risk.  And you don't have it, patch your system now instead of waiting for any additional patches for '77 and '78 =)  /mz  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
