I didn't really feel like writing a self-contained test case to initialize a KVM vCPU, so I turned QEMU into an exploit instead.  Apply the attached patch to QEMU, build it, and run it -machine accel=kvm).  --Andy  View attachment of type "text/x-patch" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
