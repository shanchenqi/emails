If we're going to advocate for accessing keyservers via https (which i think is a lovely idea, even if it doesn't mitigate all possible attacks), it's worth advocating for the well-curated hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net [0], rather than encouraging everyone to flood either https://keybase.io or https://pgp.mit.edu with traffic.  I agree with David and Thijs that OpenPGP v3 keys are long overdue for the chopping block.  	--dkg  [0] https://sks-keyservers.net/overview-of-pools.php#pool_hkps   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
