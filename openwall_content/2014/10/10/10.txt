I'd like to believe that also, but i think that some of the members of the CA cartel might be "too big to fail" in the current infrastructure.  There's no chance that the CA will go bankrupt if they aren't delisted (since the CA market is a lemon market), and every web site certified by the bigger CAs has an incentive to argue against that CAs' delisting (because it will break their web site).  And you're still relying on the targeted keyserver operators themselves to resist malicious intrusions on their keyservers (whether via legal or financial or technical coercion).  Furthermore, pointing everyone at one or two servers which may not have the capacity to withstand heavy load (or reliable uptime) runs the risk of DoS of all those users, and increases the likelihood that OpenPGP certificates simply won't get updated when those heavily-targeted machines go down.  For years, a lot of people suggested pgp.mit.edu because it was well-known, short, and easy to transmit.  in practice, pgp.mit.edu was often bogged down, and wasn't even brought up to a recent version of the modern keyserver implementation (sks) until sometime last year, i think.  (many thanks to the current pgp.mit.edu admins, btw, who appear to be currently doing a great job and providing an often-unappreciated public service!)  	--dkg   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
