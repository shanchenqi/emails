My problem with the HKPS pool is that I don't know Kristian.[1] And I don't have any reason to believe that he'd suffer serious financial damage if the private key for the "sks-keyservers.net CA" got used maliciously.[2]  (While I know that if a root CA were caught intentionally issuing an MitM cert for keybase.io or pgp.mit.edu would face likely delisting/bankruptcy.)  I'd be really happy if Kristian published a GPG-signed log of every valid certificate for servers in the HKPS pool; then it would be possible for the distrustful -- or targeted -- to, say, query multiple HKPS keyservers. This is even better than trusting Root CAs + Kristian.[3])  [1] Most hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net don't have an alternative trust path to a standard root CA.  [2] This is different from saying that I think he *would intentionally* sign a malicious cert, which I don't. I just have no idea how secure the private key for that CA is. And I know that a fully isolated, physically secure facility, and a good HSM are really expensive. (But maybe he is doing this?)  [3] If this is already available somewhere, apologies; I haven't managed to find anything like it.
