Basically that's one of the scary parts of this: 1. We have an in-protocol downgrade mechanism 2. People develop broken SSL implementations that don't work with that 3. Browsers have a non-protocol workaround that allows out-of-protocol downgrades 4. These downgrades cause compatibility issues 5. People put more duct tape around this workaround (that's not part of the protocol) by inventing a new protocol (SCSV) that adds more complexity to TLS 6. These downgrades cause security issues (NOT the first time! One of the Blackhat Virtual Host Confusion attacks also relied on these downgrades)  Basically I'd group POODLE together with BERserk as the "we could've avoided it"-vulnerabilities in SSL/TLS.  --  Hanno Böck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
