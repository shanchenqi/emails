No. If you could brute force the key then this would indicate a completely broken ciphersuite. We're usually talking about AES or 3DES here. These are considered reasonably safe.  You only get the cookie. The reason this matters is that cookies often contain a secure token that is used to indicate the session. So you can takeover a session e.g. for a mailaccount.  --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
