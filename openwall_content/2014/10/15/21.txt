There already might be a confusion from how this is presented in relation to Poodle, e.g "Here's a patch for the OpenSSL branch that adds support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV, which can be used to counter the POODLE attack"  when in fact TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV is a fix for downgrade dance. Additional CVE will help tracking these two issues and their fixes separately. --  Jan Rusnacko, Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
