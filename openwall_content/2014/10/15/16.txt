Buffer reuse is common in languages with memory safety (so that I/O  throughput is not bounded by garbage collector throughput).  The impact  is reduced (you only leak prior buffer contents, whatever that might be,  not anything which happens to be in the vicinity on the heap).  But I  don't think it's true that memory safety prevents such information leaks.  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
