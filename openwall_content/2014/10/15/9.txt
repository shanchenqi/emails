Even if no details are released at that time it would be good to have 4 hours heads up. In most circumstances this is not sufficient time to reverse and start exploiting but would allow responders to enumerate the products/systems affected and contact the owners.  In a production environment this might mean cancelling planned change requests and in development environments this might mean preparing the necessary engineering teams and test environments.  In some cases this will also make it easy for people from other time zones to have the proper incident managers engaged (provided they have less senior stuff or automation monitoring this list).  So if you are working with embargoed info consider encouraging the owners to disclose affected versions prior to the full report.
