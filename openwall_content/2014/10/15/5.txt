By the time you posted this morning, Twitter was already aflame with rumors and news orgs were already starting to post them (again, all unproven at the time), so I think it's perfectly reasonable to post here to see what others have heard (if they aren't embargoed).  If you're talking about Hanno's reply, then by the time he posted, the embargo was already lifted, and those were the official links to the issue and to the associated paper.  ~reed  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
