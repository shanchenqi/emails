Posting the exploit code a week ahead of time, maybe, but reposting that there is a problem in a 15 year protocol that uses parts with known weaknesses, which was to be released less than 12 hours later, doesn't look like a problem.  What is this list's policy on Full Disclosure?  What is this list's policy on sourced/unsourced security rumors?  Why do people on lists like this seem to think that censoring themselves and others will actually do any good. That somehow the oss-security post will be the straw that broke the camel's back and not the Internationally read news site (or all the black hat/pirate sites)? How many posts to oss-security are patient zero for embargo breaking? What about just responsible for any cracking happening in the real world?
