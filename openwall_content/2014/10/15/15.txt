It says you can recover plain text of ciphered text, using a specific method. But, in the end it means you'll have plain text + ciphered text of the same text. Does that mean you can easily bruteforce the key that was used? So that you can actually, if you logged the complete session, decipher the whole session of the user? And not only the cookie? Or breaking the key would be too complex yet?
