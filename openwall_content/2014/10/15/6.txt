Without knowing anything about the vulnerability itself, you were at least aware that something totally wrong was coming with SSLv3. So, it was letting a few hours to disable (for instance) SSLv3 on the infrastructure (or to check it had been properly done a while ago) before the issue comes out publicly with all the details and eventually PoC to exploit it. That's kind of great opportunity to make sure we're safe before it gets wrong.  Just my 2 cents.
