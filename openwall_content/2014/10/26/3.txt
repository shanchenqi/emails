The information in the comment is a bit scarce, it seems he hasn't published his sample (?). Anyway I checked the radare2-testsuite he was pointing to and found a crasher in the PE parser, I don't know if this is the same one, but I reported it upstream:  As this is a write to uninitialized memory it seems to me a CVE is deserved.  --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
