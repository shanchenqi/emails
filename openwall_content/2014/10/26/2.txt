More CVE assignments may occur later (in particular, see below about versados.c). Affected programs apparently include strings (on some but not all platforms) as well as objdump and nm. The readelf program is not affected.  is for the incorrect decrements in cases of S-records that are too short. References are:           The available information at the moment is that this is fixed in binutils (not yet available on the http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/binutils/ site), whereas new discoveries in October might not all be fixed in Regardless of the actual content of will remain a separate CVE.  (i.e., the five-byte file) is not, by itself, an attack that crosses privilege boundaries in realistic circumstances, so this report is not currently part of any CVE.   is for the current content, i.e., incorrect "--n_elt / ++idx" code that makes the attachment and attachment attacks possible.   The much earlier research by Tavis Ormandy is already covered by There is also which is an unrelated discovery.  There is currently no CVE ID for the psa-dont-run-strings-on-untrusted-files.html "0xdeadbabe October 25, PM" comment about "another one related with PE file headers parsing." In general, a separate discovery that's potentially exploitable for code execution could have its own CVE ID. Does anyone want a CVE ID for that?  Similarly, there are currently no CVE IDs for the versados.c report. Does anyone want that report covered in CVE? Depending on exploitability, it would have approximately two CVE IDs.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =+vIX -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
