Then you do in fact have a valid reason to test for and patch the individual bugs even when they're no longer security relevant.  My advice is that if you feel you're a "non-expert" in bash bugs, you simply apply all bash upstream's patches, and keep adding them to your package of bash as more upstream patches become available.  You do not need to issue security advisories (or whatever you normally do when fixing security vulnerabilities) each time: it's sufficient to do that once, when you've just included the prefix/suffix patch or equivalent).  Once you have further patches to bash are no different than e.g. the many patches that are issued for VIM (a project that tends to release hundreds of post-release patches, most of them non-security).  I hope this helps.
