I think you're exaggerating my contribution when crediting me for this simple test, and it's not that new either - I previously included it in:   and Michal included it in:   (I linked to Paul Vixie's reply here because it specifically focuses on this test rather than on the rest of Michal's lengthy posting.)  As to your timeline, you may add:  Mon, 22 Sep - notification by Florian Weimer to the (private, PGP-re-encrypting) distros list, with no detail and an offer to request detail from the Debian security team.  Specifically, the message had in bash" as the Subject and it said only:  "At UTC, we are going to disclose a significant security vulnerability in bash.  Please contact the Debian security team at <team@...urity.debian.org> to receive details and upstream patches.  Today, this alias will be staffed at least until UTC PDT)."  (Personally, I chose to wait 2 days until public disclosure, so I did not request the detail on behalf of Openwall.)  September 25, PM (unclear timezone) - Antti Louko suggests in a comment on Bruce Schneier's blog how bash could be binary-patched, but provides no analysis as to why this works (so it was likely unclear and not convincing to readers), nor a specific way to apply the patch.  September 27, AM (unclear timezone) - Antti Louko posts "a simple Python script to make the patch", still without analysis.  I mentioned the above two comments in:   And if you really want to credit me for anything, then:  PM - 28 Sep (unclear timezone) - @solardiz [hey, that's me] tweeted a one-liner bash binary patch, which turned out to be patching bash in the same way as Antti Louko had suggested:   Mon, 29 Sep - oss-security posting on the above, including analysis of why it works and what risks are involved.
