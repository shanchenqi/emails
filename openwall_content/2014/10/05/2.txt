At a quick glance, and test cases will stop working with Florian's patch (probably fine, since even if you don't have patches for these bugs, you're at almost no risk). At the same time, the test case for will claim that you're vulnerable even with Florian's patch. Next, the test case for and will probably always claim that you're vulnerable, even if you have the patch installed (haven't tested, but looks that way). And finally, the test cases for and are incomplete and won't work if pasted as-is - you'll just get a syntax error.  /mz  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
