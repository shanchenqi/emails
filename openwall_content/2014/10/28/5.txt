BTW, I changed OpenBSD's ftp(1) a while ago to just use the "filename" part of the original request, rather than taking a name from the redirection target (this also matches what curl -O does) - it's a bit less convenient in some cases, but it felt like a bad idea to allow the output filename to be under control of the remote host (though I was more thinking of the situation where someone might run it from their home directory and write to something like .profile).
