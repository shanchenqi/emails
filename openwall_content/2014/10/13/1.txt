I can confirm this is a real bug,  and I would like a CVE assigned.  I appreciate Mik reporting this.  Since it's now been discussed in public I don't see any point treating this  as embargoed.  I'm working on his patch adding BLAKE2 (eg making it pass tests, having an  option for back-compatibility) so that it can be released.   -m   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
