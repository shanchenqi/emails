Although commonly cited in the press as going back to bash we confirmed the bug exists all the way back to bash  We had to do some fairly obscure digging for this, because the old bash versions are very difficult to compile on modern setups.  Rather than just statically analyse the source, we wanted to actually test various builds. We started by building version of slackware, and got and building, confirming the bug existed in and earlier.  We also found a few binary images containing built versions of and confirmed the bug existed in those: http://images.rymate.co.uk/images/ihewGLM.png  We then worked further back in time, unearthing bash on an ancient Atari ST image: http://images.rymate.co.uk/images/iwaSGPo.png  This was also vulnerable.  This version is relevant because the first version of bash ported to linux was bash - here's the original post by Linus at the tender age of  advertising his first build of linux on the minix newsgroup in explicitly mentioning bash  This datum told us that shellshock is older than all of linux, which makes for a nice soundbite for the press.  Going back further proved very difficult because few archives including these early versions exist anywhere, and by all accounts the early releases were buggy and not particularly portable.  We eventually managed to locate an image for an obscure Japanese Human68k containing bash  Here it identifies itself as bash http://images.rymate.co.uk/images/kH8VnTo.png  The file is dated and of course it's vulnerable: http://images.rymate.co.uk/images/zTYm05I.png  That was the earliest release, either source or binary, we were able to get hold of.  We were also unable to find any documentation or even casual mention of any version between and and one of few mentions of bash is the release announcement by Brian Fox, the original developer, at the gnu.announce newsgroup:  This was announced as a beta, and we've been unable to find any mention of any earlier version.  The path to look for is but we've been unable to locate this in any archives, and at this point consider it lost - please do keep an eye out for this file!  If anyone has a way of contacting Brian Fox, he might just have an old archive of ancient versions of bash banging around which could put the question to rest once and for all - at which point exactly was shellshock introduced.  But so far, all indications lead to the implication that the bug has been in bash since its very inception in the late 80s, and before it was ever released to the public.  Regards, Riot  P.S.
