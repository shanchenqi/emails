On Fedora 20 I tried it, held the key down, it continues taking screen shots for some time after I let go, what was interesting is the screenshot files started out full size but then got smaller, then full size again, then smaller, so even on an SSD it appears that it's taking the screenshot, writing it to disk, but getting interrupted, I never got it to OOM.
