I think most of the users would say yes and most of the developers would rather work on the latest code.  :)  In the Cyanogenmod case, as of today, is labelled as "stable". Judging from the updates I've seen on my Cyanogenmod tablet, CM 11 "releases" are pre-beta snapshots.  Would you, as a Cyanogenmod user, expect that get security fixes?  FWIW, late last year, that's what Cyanogenmod said they'd do:   but if I were to judge from this, that's fallen by the wayside.    This certainly isn't an issue limited to Cyanogenmod.  As just another example, release of ntpd deemed "stable"/"production" is 3 years old, and missing the fix for the monlist amplication vulnerability (though granted that has workarounds).    It mught behoove us to call out opensource projects whose "stable" releases are way out-of-date with respect to their security exposure.  -Mike  :After reading el reg's article regarding a cyanogenmod MITM flaw, I started :looking through the code to see if I could find it. It didn't take long. :This finding was not what users are led to believe by cyanogenmod's blog :post. I reported the issue to cyanogenmod, but got a rather unsatisfactory :reply.
