It didn't take long. This finding was not what users are led to believe by cyanogenmod's blog post. I reported the issue to cyanogenmod, but got a rather unsatisfactory reply. They didn't seem willing to modify the blog post to more accurately reflect the problem. Below is my email exchange with cyanogenmod's security address:   Lord Tuskington,   Thank your for your response. Truth is we assumed as much, but the lack of meaningful information in the Register's sensational article didn't leave us much room to interpret it besides what it presented at face value.   As you noted, this has already been addressed in our shipping code branch (cm-11), prior to the article's publishing. This was the net result of the messaging provided in the blog post, with CM 11 being 'safe' from this issue.   We normally do not patch non-shipping code (in this case and prior), though we may in this case.   We do not expect to make a advisory on the item at this time.   Thank you, Abhisek Devkota    On Oct 17, PM, "Lord Tuskington" <l.tuskington@...il.com> wrote:   Hello from Greenland!
