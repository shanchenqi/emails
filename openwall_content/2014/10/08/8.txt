However, if you misconfigure the server and don't use ChrootDirectory, the user will be able to access all parts of the filesystem that he has access to - including procfs. On modern Linux kernels I think), /proc/self/maps reveals the memory layout and /proc/self/mem lets you write to arbitrary memory positions. Combine those and you get easy RCE."  It involves a number of issues coming together, however in the end it is an RCE with a legit configuration.  Changelog: http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-6.7  * sftp-server(8): On platforms that support it, use prctl() to    prevent sftp-server from accessing /proc/self/{mem,maps}  --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
