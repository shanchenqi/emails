Probably very few people outside of Red Hat would understand whether "private entitlement keys" tend to cause problems for customers. If you had a situation where:    - disclosure of an entitlement key didn't matter much     because the key is node-locked to the hardware of     a specific customer    and    - bugs sometimes caused customers to have a wrong key  then you probably wouldn't want a third party obtaining a CVE ID based on a guess that "entitlement key" seems roughly the same as sending the full contents of the /root/.ssh directory.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =KayV -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
