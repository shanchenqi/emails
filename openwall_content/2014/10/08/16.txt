We do, but for public issues we prefer to ask here sometimes so as to prevent duplicate assignments (e.g. it is possible for a race condition to occur, Red Hat and Mitre both see something new, we see no CVE for it so we both assign one).  I believe this one is (but don't quote me, wmealing is in .au and asleep so I can't confirm).  > I also wonder why this bug wasn't reported to upstream > (wrong BZ "Product" at least it should get cloned to ovirt).  Because we learned about it from an upstream source.    --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
