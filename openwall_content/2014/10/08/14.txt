I think there should be something along the lines of "reasonable expectation of privacy" here. I admit that this is subjective, but cases like the Adobe one are pretty clear. Even if it's not clear whether the vendor has a legitimate need for the data (I would say they don't, but this is not the point right now), random third parties with the ability to intercept unencrypted network traffic certainly do not have a legitimate need for it. So at the very least, I think any transmission of data where the user might have a reasonable expectation that the data is "private", if it takes place over a non-encrypted channel, is CVE-worthy.
