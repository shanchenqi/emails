I reported this to the OpenSSH developers, and although they included my patch as a mitigation, they did not treat it as a vuln in OpenSSH.  I believe that treating this as a hardening patch makes sense. The SFTP server behaves exactly as documented, it allows access to the whole filesystem. And on Linux, that happens to equal write access to the process RAM, so you should never give that access to someone who shouldn't be able to run arbitrary code.
