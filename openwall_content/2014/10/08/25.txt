Compilers  While it is too late for our hardware etc. perhaps strong type systems such as found in Haskell can help here? It is known to be very good at avoiding undefined or unexpected runtime behavior. Too late also for current languages to have this bolted on but if anyone wanted to write "secure" software I'd be looking at languages which provide some more guarantees. Too late for bash also, of course which I suppose points us back at the original problem.  --  Tracy Reed  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
