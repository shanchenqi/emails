The protocol from RFC is completely broken:   http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/security.html   http://zero-entropy.de/autokey_analysis.pdf  The symmetric schemes are probably fine but hard to set up. But it looks like the NIST provides authenticated NTP:  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
