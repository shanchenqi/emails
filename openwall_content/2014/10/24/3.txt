I think it does deserve a CVE, because it's an instance of The problem is a max 11-byte out-of-bounds read on a heap-allocated array. For debug builds this trips an assert in Qt (resulting in denial of service), otherwise it's an information leak to the user of Quassel (who may or may not be trusted).  Should a CVE be assigned, note that Quassel took the code (cipher.cpp) from Konversation, and the same issue has been reported there [1].  --  Bas Pape (Tucos)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
