Unfortunately, the buggy code can be arrived at via multiple entry points (e.g. objdump -p or nm on stringme, stringmetoo, and strings-bfd-badfree). Those are also commonly used on untrusted binaries (e.g. forensics). Fixing the core issues seems the way to go.  --mancha  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
