In the particular case of shellshock, "everyone knows" that calling eval on untrusted input is a really bad idea.   It's bad in anything that has an eval mechanism.   The problem, still, with bash is that happens without you having any control over it.  For example,     env 'BASH_FUNC_ls()=() { echo hi there; }' bash -c ls  Obviously that's artificial and the Florian's fix ensures that it's difficult to trigger remotely.   This doesn't mean that the eval over which you have no control is a good idea.  In this particular case you could argue that any application that could possibly exec a shell or possibly cross a trust boundary should clean its environment: we even have a nice easy to recognise pattern (anything that begins BASH_FUNC_ which also happens to strip out the other two implementations of the wrapper).  However, I deliberately included "possibly" twice to encompass practically all non-trivial applications.  If you're going to try to pin a class of bug on shellshock then it's something like "uncontrollable eval on untrusted input" and bash is still doing this. it's not been fixed (excepting NetBSD and FreeBSD).  jch  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
