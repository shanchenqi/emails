Well understood and yes,   it should be possible to implement mitigations against these kinds of   things.  It is not only possible, I have already posted a list of ways to find Heartbleed: http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/heartbleed.html  I think identifying specific ways to counter classes of vulnerabilities is really important.  > What class of bug is Shellshock? "Weird feature invented in   pre-Internet era"? How do you conquer this class of bugs?  I am still struggling with this one.  I am trying to create that list here: http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/shellshock.html#detect-or-prevent  But to be honest, that list is pretty pathetic. This is a challenging class of vulnerability to detect or prevent ahead of time. Ideas would be very welcome.  --- David A.Wheeler  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
