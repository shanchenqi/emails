I've been thinking about this for the past week and agree with your problem identification. However, the lesson I rescue is diametrically opposed to the one you arrived at.  An effect few mention is how dramatically things changed post-embargo. Sure, Chet's been burning the midnight oil (many thanks, Chet; you're owed many beers) but on some level, or maybe only after the dust settles, he'll be very appreciative of the way the community rallied in a highly dynamic way to ultimately help make Bash a better product.  From the identification of key breach points (thanks Stephane, Tavis, and Michal) to the development of critical hardening (thanks Florian), the level of engagement has been, and continues to be, extraordinary.  I don't know how long the initial report was embargo'd but I'm pretty sure the process became infinitely more productive after the veil of semi-secrecy was lifted (be it in metrics like LoC/hour or reports/day).  It's amazing how productive people can be when incentives are properly aligned.  Your solution is to add Tavis and Michal to distros@. What about the next flaw when the two researchers who turn out to be key are Bob and Fred? Add them next? You'll be playing catch-up.  I think the overarching lesson here is there are costs to the embargo paradigm some have grown to love and over-use. Few consider the negative effects that removing one aspect of "open" from open source can have and how energetic the process can become once it's reintroduced.  --mancha  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
