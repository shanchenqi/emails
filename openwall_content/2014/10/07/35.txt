So I was looking at Firefox and noticed on Fedora it has the Health check and crash reporter enabled by default, meaning that if Fedora crashes a bunch of information gets sent back to Mozilla (I assume), I don't know if the UI/etc pops up and lets you see what is being sent and so on, on RHEL the crash reporter appears to be disabled by default.  Also having looked at spamassassin (which has a component to retrieve and update rules) and clamav (which has freshclam to update the AV DB) both of these explicitly disable the updates, you must manually enable them.  Then I see this: which is rather timely.  So we have a continuum, at one end we have programs that explicitly make you configure them before they'll connect out, and on the other end we have apps that connect out whether or not you want them to (and being closed source on locked down hardware you probably have little to no choice in the matter).  Additionally we have the type of information and expectations, e.g. if I enable ntp or chrony I expect it to make outgoing connections to the NTP servers, which may be semi random if using the ntp.org pool servers. If I fire up a web browser and point it at openwall.com I expect traffic to go there and any ad networks/etc, I may not be expecting it to send random health reports somewhere.  So my question is basically this: where on this grey scale does it go from mildly annoying to security vulnerability (and CVE worthy), the main things being:  -what kind of information is leaked (e.g. PII? system config? just the fact that you're asking what time it is?) -assuming it makes these outgoing connections by default, how informed are users, e.g. in firefox you get a brief one time warning you can look at or does it maybe warnt he user, show them the info and then require them to confirm sending it (e.g. sosreport).
