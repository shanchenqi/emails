My question would be: Can we get that attention somehow *before* an event like shellshock happens? We probably all could name products that could have sec bugs with similar severity.  I outlined a vague idea: Would it work if we'd say we make a "sec people, please have a look at software XY"-day? Would people do that?  Heartbleed and Shellshock give me the feeling that there probably are, right now, security bugs with simliar severity active on our systems. Let's have a discussion how we can find them.  cu, --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
