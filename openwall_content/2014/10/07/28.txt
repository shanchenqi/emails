Well, that's the thing: ideas that sound good on paper are dime a dozen. Most of them have been tried, too: people have designed systems that fit Bell-LaPadula, created languages like Ada, reinvented the web to strictly isolate code & data and each site from each other, etc.  Sometimes, efforts like this fail simply due to bad timing or bad luck; but most of the time, they just produce solutions that are unusable, unappealing, or otherwise difficult to work with.  Usable and practical security is hard, and we don't really have all the answers there - we can barely scratch the surface today.  /mz  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
