So for example the article would indicate to me that this is CVE worthy under #4 for example. I also assume that "makes no statement" means the company actually has to make it easily viewed/available, e.g. not buried in some huge 60 screen long EULA/TOS, or in some random source code file ("# and here is where we send information back").   --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
