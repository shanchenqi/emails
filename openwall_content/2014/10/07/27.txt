"Weird feature invented in >    pre-Internet era"? How do you conquer this class of bugs?  There are two bugs: Calling “eval” on untrusted input (a relatively  common issue), and the fact that this particular code path should never  have been exposed to the network at all.  The second part is not  strictly a bash bug, even if we addressed that with a change in bash.  If this issue had been discovered when the first CGI-enabled web server  was implemented, maybe it would not have been called a bash bug, but a  bug in how CGI used environment variables.  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
