As you say, you use "arguably" so it would help if you'd clarify your position more explicitely.  > Unfortunately, those same people were also less productive than usual > at their other duties (including security-related) during this time > period.  That's a fact of life: resources are constrained. The question isn't whether there are 24 hours in the day but whether the overall good was being maximized in an embargo framework or not.  > It sounds like it's obvious to you that we've seen a case of > "over-use" of embargo and that "few" people "consider the negative > effects".  In this case was embargo under-used? over-used? just right? I don't know but one way to arrive at an answer is to consider things empirically. How did the process evolve in practice? Did things improve (by various metrics) post disclosure, or not, etc.  > Also, you're quoting only part of the context.
