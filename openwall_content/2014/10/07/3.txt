This is the bit from Stephane:   -- snip! -- A release schedule with public disclosure on the 24th at UTC and early notification to other unix and linux vendors on the 22nd and select infrastructure provider notification (such as CDNs including Microsoft) on the 23rd proposed on the 16th by Florian.  [...]  bashdoor.com was registered (not by me) with a creation date of UTC sometime before according to whois. Florian also said here that someone brought the early notification sent to vendors/infrastructure to the press, so someone obviously intended to take it to the press. I don't know whom. -- snip! --  The bashdoor.com thing sounds a bit damning (doesn't sound like something that would be in the notifications to CDNs & co?).  /mz  On Mon, Oct 6, at PM, Solar Designer <solar@...nwall.com> wrote: > Florian, > > On Mon, Oct 06, at Michal Zalewski wrote: >> I don't think it happened on Twitter - using advanced search with date >> ranges, I don't see any mentions that would predate this article, >> which already seems to be using the term: >> >> >> >> It's odd that an article posted at 8 AM on Sept 24 would have any idea >> of how the bug is already being called by the security community, >> especially ahead of any Twitter buzz.
