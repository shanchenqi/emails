I don't know who coined the Shellshock name, but I'd like us to know whether there was in fact a leak, and when.  (Luckily, I know it couldn't have been from the distros list, because no detail was posted to the distros list, thanks!)  I had raised this concern here:   It is insufficient that "it was an honest mistake" and that "apologies were made and accepted."  I have no intent to place blame, but at least the general public needs to know whether the information got to the press before or after the scheduled coordinated public disclosure date/time ("Wednesday, UTC").  If it's before, then this qualifies as a leak. If it's after, then it does not.  The article has "Sep 24, AM PT" on it, which is UTC. Did the article's author receive the information before or after and when exactly?  NB: Please do not provide any information on this to me in private. If you're able to address my question, please do so on the list.
