Possibly, but it probably wouldn't have stayed that way for long. Even though the bug was introduced long before the arrival of Apache, I would guess that it had affected Sendmail from day one.  In practice, it's usually counterproductive to try to precisely pin the blame; bash is the place where we can fix it more easily and produce more intuitive behavior with one less things for other developers to worry about it.  /mz  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
