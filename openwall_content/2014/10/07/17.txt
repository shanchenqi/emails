I am fully with you on that. I advocate CSP and prepared statements where I can and Softbound+CETS (trying to kill all C-memory-errors) looks really interesting.  However I won't go as far as claiming that fixing bugs is pointless. Two thoughts on that: * We have to live with what we have now. We can talk that it'd be   better to re-write all our operating systems in better languages, but   even considering that happens it won't happen any time soon. We have   to fix the bugs in the software we use today. * Heartbleed is an out of bounds memory read. Well understood and yes,   it should be possible to implement mitigations against these kinds of   things. What class of bug is Shellshock? "Weird feature invented in   pre-Internet era"? How do you conquer this class of bugs?  My point is: Even if we eliminate classes of bugs there will still be security issues that don't fit in your bug class cateogries.  --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
