Stored XSS. A persistent XSS vulnerability was found in Zenoss core, by creating a malicious host with the Title <script>alert("Xss")</script> any user browsing to the relevant manufacturers page will get a client-side script executed immediately.  Proof of concept: 1. Create a device with with the Title <script>alert("XSS")</script>  2. Navigate to the  Infrastructure -> Manufacturers page.  3. pick the name of the manufacturer of the device, e.g. Intel  4. select the type of the hardware the device is assigned to, e.g. GenuineIntel_ Intel(R) Core(TM) CPU _  5. the XSS Executes.     <tr class="even">       <td class="tablevalues"><a href='/zport/dmd/Devices/Server/Linux/devices/localhost/devicedetail'><script>alert("xss")</script></a></td>       <td class="tablevalues">GenuineIntel_        Intel(R) Core(TM) CPU _     </tr>    2. Open Redirect vulnerability. an open redirect is possible via http://zenoss http://malicious-website.com ]  allowing an attacker to redirect a user to a malicious website.
