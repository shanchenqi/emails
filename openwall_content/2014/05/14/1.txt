I am not familiar enough with cryptography to know if they need CVEs, or  are considered hardening (the last one sounds CVE worthy though)  Cheers,  -- Murray McAllister / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
