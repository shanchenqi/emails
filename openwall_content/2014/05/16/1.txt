References have been added to the issue description.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  When loading a 32-bit ARM guest kernel the Xen tools did not correctly validate the length of the kernel against the actual image size.  This would then lead to an overrun on the input buffer when loading the kernel into guest RAM  Furthermore when checking a 32-bit guest kernel for an appended DTB, the Xen tools were prone to additional overruns also leading to an overrun on the input buffer when loading the kernel into guest RAM  Also, the tools would access a field in the putative DTB header without checking for its alignment  When loading a 64-bit ARM guest kernel the tools similarly did not fully validate the requested load addresses, possibly leading to an overrun on the input buffer when loading the kernel into guest RAM  IMPACT ======  An attacker who can control the kernel used to boot a guest can exploit these issues.  Exploiting the overflow issues allows information which follows the guest kernel in the toolstack address space to be copied into the guest's memory, constituting an information leak.  Alternatively either the overflow or alignment issues could be used to crash the toolstack process, leading to a denial of service.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  ARM systems are vulnerable from Xen 4.4 onwards.  MITIGATION ==========  Ensuring that guests use only trustworthy kernels will avoid this problem.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Thomas Leonard.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.  xsa95.patch        xen-unstable, Xen 4.4.x  $ xsa95*.patch  xsa95.patch $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =ivP8 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment "xsa95.patch" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
