Summary: the openshift.sh installer script created default passwords for various services during install, this has been fixed. A current copy of the script is available at https://github.com/openshift/openshift-extras/blob/enterprise-2.1/enterprise/install-scripts/generic/openshift.sh  I also wanted to open up a discussion as well, what counts as shipped software, e.g. more and more projects have a bash script linked off the front page/install page, my take on this is if it's "officially" endorsed by the project and prominent it should probably count as "shipped" software and get a CVE (assuming it has a security flaw), but we shouldn't assign CVE's to every instance of install scripts found online (e.g. lots of them squirrelled away inside of GitHub).   - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  oFusqBwU3/mMIxdKQwE3 =pyOp -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
