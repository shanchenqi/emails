While waiting for the original reporter's PoC/more information, Guillem  Jover (dpkg maintainer) independently re-discovered the issue, and a second  one. This second issue has now been publicly reported as [2] to ease the  assignment of CVE id(s) given the combination of private and not-very- specific public information.  Both issues are independent of the version of the patch tool.  While figuring out whether one or two ids should be requested (at least from  our POV), it appears that we can say that [2] is a superset of [1] - this is  based on the minimal fixes needed to fix either vulnerability: the fix for [1]  does not fix [2], but the fix for [2] does fix [1].  Could a CVE id be assigned please?  CC'ing Guillem for any complimentary information.  Thanks in advance.  [1] [2]  Cheers, --  Raphael Geissert - Debian Developer www.debian.org - get.debian.net  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
