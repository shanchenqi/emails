[1]  I applaud both the Linux Foundation and all its corporate sponsors for their inspiring leadership and vision.  In the case of OpenSSL, some of the funding will be channeled through the Open Crypto Audit Project (OCAP) which is being charged with its security audit.  OCAP can benefit greatly from reviewing OpenBSD's ongoing OpenSSL audit/review process which was the genesis for LibreSSL. I am cc'ing OCAP so they might comment on how the LibreSSL effort will factor into their workplan.  Further, I am aware the OpenBSD Foundation has reached out to CII to request LibreSSL funding support. Given OpenBSD's solid track record and the leadership and initiative they've demonstrated through LibreSSL, I would appreciate if CII (also cc'd) would comment on that outstanding request.  Many thanks.  --mancha  [1]   Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
