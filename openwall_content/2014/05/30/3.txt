Use for this vulnerability in (only) Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. The points we considered from our perspective (not necessarily in order of importance) are:   - deciding whether an issue is within, or outside, the scope of CVE    can depend on practices of other vendors, not the change process    that is used by a specific vendor     Related to this, Red Hat could decide to not recognize the CVD ID    within its change process, A few years ago, Red Hat had been doing    this through the NVD Vendor Comments mechanism, for example: see    "Official Statement from Red Hat" under    and       - from the perspective of an arbitrary end user, the    document doesn't    really seem to imply that the sosreport data would commonly need to    be reviewed, because there is no discussion of potentially    sensitive information   - the "No space left on device" discussion seems to imply that    there's a big file in some cases, and people might reasonably    decline to review a big file unless told to do so   - on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (only), nobody is telling them to do    so   - although it's completely true that "An 'attacker' can only benefit    from the information if an authorized user makes it available to    them," making it available is the common and intended purpose of    using the sosreport feature   - it's reasonable for an organization to have an internal security    policy that no password may be sent to the Technical Support    branch of any vendor   - in a typical large enterprise, there may be dozens of software    products that have "prepare/send debugging information to Technical    Support" features, and often (because of the nature of other    software products), there is no possibility of sending a password   - thus, for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (only), the potential presence    of a password, coupled with the lack of warning, seems to sometimes    violate reasonable expectations, and some end users would probably    make use of a CVE ID to track this  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =tDOk -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
