Reported by Matthew Daley to security@...nel.org.  There apparently exists a proof of concept root exploit, that allows local users with access to a floppy device to execute code in the linux kernel.  (I think this needs a floppy driver to actually allow access to a floppy  device. My machine only says "floppy0: no floppy controllers found" today.)  Linux Kernel Mainline commits:  Author: Matthew Daley <mattd@...fuzz.com> Date:   Mon Apr 28      floppy: don't write kernel-only members to FDRAWCMD ioctl output      Do not leak kernel-only floppy_raw_cmd structure members to userspace.     This includes the linked-list pointer and the pointer to the allocated     DMA space.
