The lxml.html.clean module cleans up HTML by removing embedded or script content, special tags, CSS style annotations and much more. It was found [1] that the clean_html() function, provided by the lxml.html.clean module, did not properly clean HTML input if it included non-printed characters A remote attacker could use this flaw to serve malicious content to an application using the clean_html() function to process HTML, possibly allowing the attacker to inject malicious code into a website generated by this application.  This issue has been reported upstream at [2] and a patch is available at [3].
