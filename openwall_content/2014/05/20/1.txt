In order to ensure full traceability, we need a CVE number assigned that we can attach to further notifications. This issue is already public, although an advisory was not sent yet.  Title: Heat template URL information leakage Reporter: Jason Dunsmore (Rackspace) Products: Heat Versions: to and  Description: Jason Dunsmore from Rackspace reported a vulnerability in Heat. An authenticated user may temporarily see the URL of a provider template used in another tenant by listing heat resources types. This may result in disclosure of additional information if the template itself can be accessed. The URL disappears from the listing after a certain point in the stack creation. All Heat setups are affected.
