This includes Laravel, FuelPHP, Lithium, CodeIgniter and CakePHP and probably many others.  In most cases, this is only exploitable if the programmer (framework user) makes the (debatable) "mistake" of querying attacker-controlled column names, but in Laravel's case even simple mass assignment exposes this vulnerability, *even* if some fields are $guarded against being mass-assigned.  Unfortunately, most framework authors seem to dismiss this issue as purely a user problem and might not even bother fixing the issue or adding extra safeguards to the framework to achieve defense in depth. This attitude only contributes to the security crisis, IMHO.  For more information, see my blog post at my employer's research blog: http://www.codeyellow.nl/identifier-sqli.html  I don't know whether any of these deserve CVE IDs, especially considering the aforementioned attitude; authors believe this is not a bug (even in the case of Laravel).  I don't have the time, knowledge and energy to investigate every single framework in every single language, but I think it's a good idea if the community at large took a closer look at this particular class of bugs. So far, the only framework which seems to do it correctly is Ruby on Rails.  But I must confess I didn't look beyond PHP, Python and Ruby.  In Python, the situation is a little more complicated: Django uses bad identifier quotation but I have been unable to create a PoC, as it seems to perform whitelisting everywhere on field names.  This warrants further investigation, IMHO.
