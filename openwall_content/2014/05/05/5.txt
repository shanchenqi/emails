There doesn't seem to be a vendor response yet. Also, it seems that this might be described as a process crash, not a "system" crash.  Failure of client code to consider resource consumption, including resources consumed only when facing a malicious server, does not always result in a CVE assignment. For example, client application code isn't always responsible for deciding when a server seems to be sending it an infinitely large file. One case in which a CVE can be assigned is a client that expresses specific goals for abandoning server communication based on elapsed time, data rate, amount of data, etc., but has an implementation error in achieving those goals.  The main question at this point is whether an exception has to be made for Erlang. In other words, because of a "reliability model" or something similar in Erlang, is it always a vulnerability if an Erlang module lacks reasonable restrictions on resource consumption?  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =Wlpm -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
