I agree that this CVE still remains rather unclear.  The original assignment that is limited to:    - libxml2 internal entity expansion   - libxml2 external entities expansion  does not really help clarify what was the original intention of the CVE, and its current use does not seem consistent with what I believe the intention was.  > Patch for the entity expansion DoS: >  That commit is referenced by which currently has a sufficiently clear description of being a XEE DoS issue, really a billion laughs variant, or even a incomplete fix.  > Patch for not expanding external entities by default: >  That commit is indeed listed as reference for  Note that it's not about expanding, but about (not) loading and parsing external entities when entity expansion is disabled.  The initial assignment just says "libxml2 external entities expansion" with no other details, which I tend to read as "libxml2 performs expansion of external entities by default, which leads to the usual XXE issues".  Such assignment seems incorrect, as libxml2 does not expand entities (internal or external) by default, it only does so when entity substitution is requested using XML_PARSE_NOENT parser option.  Current CVE description "libxml2 through does not properly handle external entities expansion unless an application developer uses the xmlSAX2ResolveEntity or xmlSetExternalEntityLoader function, ...", which may mean "when libxml2 is instructed to perform entity expansion, there's no easy way to make it only expand internal entities and avoid external entities to avoid XXE issues".  That seems correct, as there is no option to make libxml2 only process internal entities and raise error when external entity is encountered. It provides XML_PARSE_NONET parser option to avoid using remote external entities, but nothing similar to block local external entities (i.e. issues with reading /etc/passwd, huge file, or fifo file).  However, the above commit does not make a difference here.  It does not prevent fetching of external entities when parsing with NOENT.  It is not a fix for the CVE if defined this way.  AFAICS, description should either be updated to correctly describe how the id was used (correctly or not) for issue fixed via commit, or a new id is required for  > Are both patches covered? The second one is quite important as it > kills the classic XXE vector <!ENTITY foo SYSTEM "/etc/passwd">  I don't believe actually makes a difference for this specific case.  When parsing without NOENT, /etc/passwd was loaded, but foo entity references were not replaced by the passwd file content.  When parsing with NOENT, does not change libxml2 behavior.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
