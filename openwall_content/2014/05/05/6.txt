When two processes/threads write to the same pty, the buffer end could be overwritten and so memory corruption into adjacent buffers could lead to crashes / code execution.  Jiri Slaby and Peter Hurley localized and fixed this problem.  has been assigned to this issue.  Jiri thinks this was introduced during development by (pty: Rework the pty layer to use the normal buffering logic) in Until then, pty was writing directly to a line discipline without using buffers.   Patch is also attached.
