That is, if you use DocumentBuilderFactory's setExpandEntityReferences method and supply "false", then it has a very similar behavior.  I'm about to release a comprehensive XXE paper, and here's a preview of what I have written about it:  "Java developers who use the default parser (or a newer version of Xerces-J) need to change one or more settings to make Xerces reasonably safe when processing untrusted XML.  One behavior to be aware of is the fact that the DocumentBuilderFactory's setExpandEntityReferences method does not provide protection as one might expect.  Calling this method with a "false" argument causes the parser to omit external entity data in the document when referenced, but it does not prevent definitions of external entities.  This means the parser will still fetch external URLs, which could obviously be used for blind SSRF attacks (even if the content isn't used later in the document).   Worse still, this setting does not prevent full use of external parameter entities, which would likely allow an attacker to conduct all of the same attacks that are possible with regular external entities."  Should we assign a CVE for this as well?  I believe I tested versions and though I'd want someone to verify this, since it has been some time since I observed the behavior.  tim     On Tue, May 06, at Tomas Hoger wrote: > On Tue, 06 May Nicolas GrĂŠgoire wrote: >  > > > libxml2 [...] incorrectly performs entity substituton in the doctype > > > prolog, even if the application using libxml2 disabled any entity > > > substitution.  > >  > > I'm not sure that I understand this bug.
