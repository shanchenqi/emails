Also, nobody has sent MITRE's cve-assign team a PoC in which running seunshare contributes to a privilege escalation. might be considered an "exposure." Essentially, running seunshare is a way to bypass a potentially important protection mechanism, and that wasn't a documented effect of installing seunshare.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =P4Px -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
