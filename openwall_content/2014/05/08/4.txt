One thing  I will ensure in future is to CC cve-assign@ to minimize the chanc of a duplicate.  Also as usual if you want to make a private request information on how to do so is available here:  http://people.redhat.com/kseifrie/CVE-OpenSource-Request-HOWTO.html  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =OJo4 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
