The outcome of is that C-style filenames aren't accepted. However, we probably can't assign a CVE ID for a root cause of "attempts to support C-style filenames," because supporting those filenames isn't inherently unsafe if an OS vendor is programmatically, or by policy, ensuring that the patch program is one that interacts safely with that support.  The    updated dpkg in squeeze + patch(1) from squeeze = vulnerable  behavior is something that seems to be best categorized as a release engineering problem. Although there are very few cases in which CVE IDs have been assigned for release engineering problems, these problems can be within the scope of CVE, and the current one is. Use for this issue. In other words, because squeeze's new dpkg program is incompatible, in a security-relevant way, with squeeze's patch program, the two should not have been allowed to exist together within any correctly maintained/supported squeeze environment.  However, there is another question that could possibly result in a second CVE ID. On wheezy, there's apparently a security problem in, at least, these two cases:    1. the installed patch program is an older version of patch that's      identical to squeeze's supported version of patch. Possibly, this      can happen on a correctly maintained/supported Debian system      because sometimes a system is in a partially upgraded state. In      particular, the vulnerability affects root's use of dpkg, which      may be a completely expected activity because the administrator      might want to unpack a source package even though an upgrade is      unfinished.    2. the patch program in root's path is not something obtained from      Debian, e.g., the administrator intentionally decided to install      a non-GNU patch program  We're not sure what can be done about case 1. The general issue is that, when doing an upgrade of an arbitrary OS, the system might intermittently be in a state in which incompatibility of old-OS-version programs and new-OS-version programs has a major security risk. Maybe the right answer is a policy that nobody is allowed to do anything while an upgrade is in progress. In other words, regular users may not be logged in, and root should only be running the upgrade program and nothing else. ("nothing else" is impractical; realistically, risk is reduced by running as little else as possible.)  Case 2 possibly violates the expectations of the concept of a Linux distribution OS or other OS. In other words, the dpkg program requires the patch program, and therefore the administrator must ensure that the patch program (at least, in root's path) is the one provided by the OS vendor. If the administrator decided to install any other patch program, the resulting security problem would typically be considered a site-specific problem and thus outside the scope of CVE. However, a CVE ID could be assigned of any of these is true:    - on wheezy, dpkg doesn't have any explicit requirements about the     patch program    - the dpkg documentation states that a non-GNU patch program can be     used if desired    - Debian has a general policy that a supported program (such as     dpkg) must be robust in the face of non-standard but reasonable     site-specific software changes. In other words, if Debian program     1 allows arbitrary code execution in situations where the     administrator replaces Debian program 2 with an     often-considered-equivalent non-Debian program, this is supposed     to be treated as a vulnerability in Debian program 1.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJTYustAAoJEKllVAevmvmswDgIAIhRUCoIuvrHcrVlhEH2aicu =PQIS -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
