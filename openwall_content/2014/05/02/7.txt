Speaking of which Theo: should we get you or an > OpenBSD deputy (Bob Beck?) onto distros@?  "So OpenBSD gets notified for sure"... That is kind of weird.  Read the commit message.  It is originally from the OpenSSL lists.  Do none of you read the lists?  It's obvious the OpenSSL developers don't.  The errata would have gone out same day Ted commited the fix, except I was in the Atlas mountains... and then it was forgotten until I got back home.  I'm sure you've all got your "processes" for handling these things. But then you get paid for handling these things in some way, don't you?  We don't get paid.  And therefore, I don't know where I should find the time to be on another mailing list.  It is not like I would have sent a mail to anyone.  In general our processes are simply commit & publish.  So I'll decline.  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
