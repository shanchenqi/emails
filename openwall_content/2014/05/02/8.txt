So the intention was to disable only hostname verification, for compatibility with Crypt::SSLeay (why?!), but the effect is that the SSL_verify_mode is set to 0.  So this probably needs a CVE. My thought being that you meant to disable hostname checks, and ended up disabling all verification, so I guess it's a fine line since disabling host name checks means an attacker can use any C you trust to get a cert for a hostname they control and mitm you, but if you are using an internal CA this would allow a mitm that was not possible without this flaw, so there can be a violation in a relatively not completely insane setup.  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =APK7 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
