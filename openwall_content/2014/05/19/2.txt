There does not seem to be much documentation available on the openfiler.com web site, at least not under the http://openfiler.com/learn page. http://www.openfiler.com/learn/how-to/graphical-installation says "You can learn how to manage the Openfiler system by browsing the administrator guide online which can be found here" and this is a link to the http://www.openfiler.com/docs/manual/ URL, which yields a "Page not found" error.  (possibly out-of-date) says "The official manual is not free."  As far as we can tell from the graphical-installation page, Openfiler is a Linux distribution, and all of the Linux accounts (including root) are under the control of an application-level account named openfiler. The attacks seem to require access to this account or possibly an equivalent account. Although the ability to use ` characters for shell commands is arguably a bug, an attacker with access to the openfiler account can apparently change the root password and other passwords, and then login directly to execute any commands as root.  For example (again, possibly out-of-date):      As far as the GUI is concerned, the 'root' account is just a normal   user. You need to log in as 'openfiler' to administer the system.  Maybe there's an argument that one only needs network connectivity to TCP port for the administrative web interface, but one needs connectivity to TCP port 22 (maybe?) to login as root.  Also, seems to be about XSS attacks conducted by the openfiler account against the openfiler account.  The issues can have CVE IDs only if there's privilege escalation in a realistic way.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =3gFo -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
