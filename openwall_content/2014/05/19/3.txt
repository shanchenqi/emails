It is possible that the and messages are referring to exactly the same issue: in that case, there will be only one CVE ID in total. (The messages are somewhat different -- for example, doesn't directly mention that exploitability is unproven -- but this may be a wording difference and not anything inherent about the code in versus prereleases.)  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =ysDB -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
