First, we should mention that a single CVE ID cannot be used for a set of related issues that have different affected versions. For the earlier message that mentioned and approximately two more CVE IDs will be needed. We will send those later.  For "a symlink attack that doesn't depend on a race condition," ultimately the answer is yes, you can have a separate CVE ID - use Probably at least a few oss-security readers would want us to explain why, so here's the explanation for them.  When there are discoveries of two instances of essentially the same composite, and there's any difference in the set of weaknesses for those two instances, we might want to have a general rule that two separate CVE IDs are always assigned. In practice, the Symlink Following composite is treated as somewhat of a special case in CVE. If we have one Symlink Following instance associated with two weaknesses, and a different Symlink Following instance associated with three weaknesses, we sometimes assign only one CVE ID. Possibly we will reevaluate that. (There's also often a complication that the available information is only that distinct Symlink Following instances exist; the information about the weaknesses is missing.)  For the code fixed in the commit, an additional factor is that the Symlink Following composite exists and is relevant, but there's a more important attack that does not rely on Symlink Following. In between when the temporary filename is chosen and when the temporary filename is used, the attacker can place something at the temporary pathname. One option is a symlink, and fish will follow that symlink and perhaps overwrite an important file. Another option is a plain world writable file. In that case, fish writes to the file, but the attacker can change the contents of the file immediately before fish proceeds to execute the file. Thus, even if we did the abstraction based on "same commonly used composite name," we would still end up with a different CVE ID than for the new "symlink attack that doesn't depend on a race condition" report, because the code isn't solely characterized by a Symlink Following composite. Finally, we probably don't want to have two CVE IDs for a single case where mktemp is introduced - even when both Symlink Following and (roughly speaking) code injection are possible from the same set of weaknesses.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =FOxU -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
