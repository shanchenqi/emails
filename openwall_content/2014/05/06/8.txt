The set of issues is unusual and may ultimately require more than one CVE ID.  At the moment, it seems that the most straightforward CVE assignment is for the following statement in    "If you google for HTTPS_CA_FILE you will probably only find    references to LWP/Crypt::SSLeay. So, in a way, it makes sense to    special case this because these are mostly users of the older LWP    versions."  This seems to be, more or less, equivalent to "the behavior of the product is determined by using somewhat arbitrary environment variables that, in practice, are correlated with whether the user may desire a 'compatibility mode' with different security properties, even though this correlation isn't especially strong."  Off hand, we don't know of any other product that does something like that. So, we're assigning for the Least Surprise violation.  There's a separate question of whether the "compatibility mode" behavior has an implementation that matches its design. A second CVE ID seems reasonably likely, but the issue itself is perhaps still being analyzed. says "contrary to what the name of the option suggests, verify_hostname is supposed to enable/disable both certificate verification and that the certificate matches hostname. But after this patch applied, it will affect only the latter."  At this point, it seems unlikely that there would be a third CVE for whether the "compatibility mode" behavior actually should not exist.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =HQLw -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
