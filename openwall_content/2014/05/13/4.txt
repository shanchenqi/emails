Too large L2 table sizes cause unbounded allocations. Images actually created by qemu-img only have byte or 4k L2 tables.  To keep things consistent with cluster sizes, allow ranges between bytes and 64k (in fact, down to 1 entry = 8 bytes is technically working, but L2 table sizes smaller than a cluster don't make a lot of sense).  This also means that the number of bytes on the virtual disk that are described by the same L2 table is limited to at most 8k * 64k or preventively avoiding any integer overflows.
