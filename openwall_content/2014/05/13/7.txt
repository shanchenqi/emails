In other words, although the patch corresponds to two bug discoverers, only one discoverer found a security problem.  To clarify: we are currently interpreting "dev->setup_len == sizeof(dev->data_buf) seems fine, no need to fail migration" to mean that "dev->setup_len >= sizeof(dev->data_buf)" is too strict a test, and "dev->setup_len > sizeof(dev->data_buf)" is sufficient. It does not imply that an attacker can cross privilege boundaries and cause a denial of service (i.e., a failed migration) by triggering the "dev->setup_len == sizeof(dev->data_buf)" condition.  The "dev->setup_index >= sizeof(dev->data_buf)" test was also removed. Similarly, we are interpreting this to mean that that test is superfluous. We are not interpreting this to mean that that test had allowed a denial of service attack.  Use for the "When state is DATA, passing index > len will cause memcpy with negative length, resulting in heap overflow" issue.  Note that a related recent commit:     has a assignment from Red Hat. See     The patch represents additional changes needed after that fix.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =TKjZ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
