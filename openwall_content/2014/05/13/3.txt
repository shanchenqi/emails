When state is DATA, passing index > len     will cause memcpy with negative length,     resulting in heap overflow  An user able to alter the saved VM data(either on the disk or over the wire  during migration) could use this flaw to to corrupt QEMU process memory on the  (destination) host, which could potentially result in arbitrary code execution  on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.
