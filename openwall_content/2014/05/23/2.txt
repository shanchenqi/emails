This actually needs two CVE IDs because there are two affected functions, with different sets of affected versions. (For example, there is a psub vulnerability in version but there is no funced vulnerability in because funced didn't yet exist.)  For the psub vulnerability, please continue to use  For the funced vulnerability, please use   >>   fish version restricts incoming connections to localhost only.

At present, we're not assigning an additional CVE ID for this "local users ... elevate their privileges" issue. Our interpretation is that you're not trying to make an announcement that is a vulnerable version. Instead, you're trying to document the machine environment on which fish_config in can be safely used (i.e., machines with untrusted local users are not fully supported for fish_config at the moment). If you actually wanted a CVE ID for versions and earlier, referring to the fish_config attack by local users, please let us know.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =hj0E -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
