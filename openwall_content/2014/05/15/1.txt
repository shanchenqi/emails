Prepend '.sig' to the advisory URLs for detached PGP signatures (signed with my key).  We would also kindly request that CVEs be assigned for the above issues.  Thanks, Mikkel Krautz on behalf of the Mumble Team PGP: -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Comment: GPGTools - https://gpgtools.org  =FRzo -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
