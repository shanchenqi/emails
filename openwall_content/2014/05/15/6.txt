In other words, although the concepts of missing validation are similar, and the impacts may be the same, the types of validation can be categorized separately. Thus, there are four CVE IDs.  > When loading a 32-bit ARM guest kernel the Xen tools did not correctly > validate the length of the kernel against the actual image size. This > would then lead to an overrun on the input buffer when loading the > kernel into guest RAM.  Use   > Furthermore when checking a 32-bit guest kernel for an appended DTB, > the Xen tools were prone to additional overruns also leading to an > overrun on the input buffer when loading the kernel into guest RAM.  Use   > Also, the tools would access a field in the putative DTB header > without checking for its alignment.  Use   > When loading a 64-bit ARM guest kernel the tools similarly did not > fully validate the requested load addresses, possibly leading to an > overrun on the input buffer when loading the kernel into guest RAM.
