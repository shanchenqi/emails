The file is then being exported to Red Hat, we don't really need or want the password, we also make an effort to sanitize the data sent, so if nothing else this falls into the "intended/advertised security feature that failed" and would qualify for a CVE as such as I understand things.   - --  Kurt Seifried - Red Hat - Product Security - Cloud stuff and such PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =s9TQ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
