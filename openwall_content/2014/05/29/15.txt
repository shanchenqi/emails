However, without more details about these "additional > vectors" we're kinda shooting in the dark. Can you share more details?  Matasano just released a paper on this particular vulnerability that you might want to check out.  "Jeff Jarmoc explains why the recent Ruby on Rails 'implicit render' vulnerability is more serious than many have been lead to believe. In this paper he shows how to go from an arbitrary file read under highly unusual configurations to RCE in more common setups."   ~reed  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
