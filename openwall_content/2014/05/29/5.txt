We realize that the eventual code changes might not include something exactly equivalent to this. At least at the moment, there are no CVE IDs for other issues listed in the post. Similarly, there is no CVE ID for the higher-level concept that "config AUDITSYSCALL" existed but was not marked BROKEN.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =ewfF -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
