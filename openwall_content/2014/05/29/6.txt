This may contain plain text  passwords (or a link to the file containing them), for example,  credentials for Samba mounts. This could leak passwords to an attacker  who is able to access the archive. Sensitive information in "/etc/fstab"  should be sanitized before being stored by sosreport.  Note that "/etc/fstab" is world-readable, so local attackers should not  be a concern (they can read the file anyway). This could be an issue  when the sosreport is sent to other parties.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Dolev Farhi of F5 Networks for reporting  this issue.  I think it should have a CVE, but I am less sure due to "/etc/fstab"  being world-readable, so I have not assigned one.
