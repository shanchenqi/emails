Can you clarify the scope of this CVE?  says:    OpenShift Enterprise openshift-origin-broker: default password creation    The OpenShift Enterprise openshift-origin-broker configures a default password:    /etc/openshift/broker.conf:MONGO_PASSWORD="mooo"   /etc/openshift/broker.conf:MONGO_PASSWORD="mongopass"    Please note that the optional installer also did this previously:    https://github.com/openshift/openshift-extras/blob/enterprise-2.0/enterprise/install-scripts/generic/openshift.sh   For the openshift.sh script, we think you might mean something like (this isn't really the right branch):     in which, possibly, the scope of the CVE is both:     enterprise/install-scripts/generic/openshift.sh  and     enterprise/install-scripts/openshift.ks  but not      enterprise/install-scripts/amazon/openshift-amz.sh  which has a different type of issue?  Possibly a more important question is the status of MONGO_PASSWORD="mooo" - there's no "mooo" anywhere in Instead, "mooo" apparently comes from:    https://github.com/openshift/origin-server/blob/master/broker/conf/broker.conf  and is not yet fixed in that github.com copy of the code.  So, we could potentially model this as:    1. "different affected versions" in the sense that if someone wasn't      using Red Hat's RPMs and instead updated everything from      github.com after seeing they would have the      patches but would still      have "mooo"  or    2. "different affected products" in the sense that "mooo" is a      vulnerability affecting the OpenShift Enterprise product (or      specifically the openshift/origin-server package), whereas      is a non-identical      vulnerability in the openshift/openshift-extras package  In other words, we don't know the interpretation in which "mooo" and end up with the same CVE ID.  (We didn't try to determine why your quoted broker.conf has two MONGO_PASSWORD= lines, but https://github.com/openshift/origin-server/blob/master/broker/conf/broker.conf has only one MONGO_PASSWORD= line.)   > I also wanted to open up a discussion as well, what counts as shipped > software, e.g. more and more projects have a bash script linked off > the front page/install page, my take on this is if it's "officially" > endorsed by the project and prominent it should probably count as > "shipped" software and get a CVE (assuming it has a security flaw), > but we shouldn't assign CVE's to every instance of install scripts  The unpatched code such as contained this comment:    # While this script serves as a good example script for installing a   # single host, it is not comprehensive nor robust enough to be considered   # a proper enterprise installer on its own. Production installations will   # typically require significant adaptations or an entirely different   # method of installation. Please adapt it to your needs.  Typically, if a piece of code is simply not intended to be used as-is, it can't have CVE assignments for its vulnerabilities. The situation would be different if (for example) any Linux distribution shipped openshift.sh with conflicting documentation, or executed openshift.sh automatically.  This might mean that the best scope of is only the default broker.conf file (because that issue is known to actually affect the Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 2 product).  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
