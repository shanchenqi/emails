The proposed CVE mappings for all four of these CVEs are indicated below; these would potentially start to be processed for the cve.mitre.org web site as early as today.   (revised CVE description to be published at soon):  dpkg on Debian squeeze introduces support for the "C-style encoded filenames" feature without recognizing that the squeeze patch program lacks this feature, which triggers an interaction error that allows remote attackers to conduct directory traversal attacks and modify files outside of the intended directories via a crafted source package. NOTE: this can be considered a release engineering problem in the effort to fix    (new CVE to be published at and soon):  dpkg before and before expect the patch program to be compliant with a need for the "C-style encoded filenames" feature, but is supported in environments with noncompliant patch programs, which triggers an interaction error that allows remote attackers to conduct directory traversal attacks and modify files outside of the intended directories via a crafted source package. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of reliance on unrealistic constraints on the behavior of an external program.    (new CVE to be published at and soon):  (reference is  Directory traversal vulnerability in dpkg-source allows remote attackers to modify files outside of the intended directories via a crafted source package that lacks a --- header line.    (new CVE to be published at and soon):  (reference is  Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in dpkg-source allow remote attackers to modify files outside of the intended directories via a source package with a crafted Index: pseudo-header in conjunction with (1) missing --- and +++ header lines or (2) a +++ header line with a blank pathname.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =jt0J -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
