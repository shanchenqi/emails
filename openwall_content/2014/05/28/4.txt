I believed in error, it seems.  Sorry, hectic; it had been raised as possibly a good idea, but not acted upon.  Process improvement forthcoming, we'll try to include linux-distros@ in future.  Todd's investigation has not discovered any Linux distribution other than Gentoo which even made EXPERIMENTAL_DMARC an available build option, and for Gentoo it was a use-flag.  Nor do FreeBSD, OpenBSD or DragonFlyBSD (DPorts checked), although PkgSrc in NetBSD also exposed DMARC as a build option.  - -Phil, pdp@...m.org -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----  =bBJS -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
