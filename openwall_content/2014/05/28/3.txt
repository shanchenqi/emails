Flaw introduced with that option in Exim which was previously the current release; no prior releases affected.  EXPERIMENTAL_DMARC is not on by default.  is with only this fix.  Exploitation difficulty should be considered "trivial".  (We're also about to start the RC series for which has many many  more changes; this issue warranted backport).  Heads-up went to packagers who've worked closely with us in the past and, I believe, belatedly to linux-distros@.  That included the new release tarballs and the separated out patch, also PGP-signed (by an Exim Maintainer key in the Strong Set, per our policy, to maximise chances of verifiability).  Root cause: lack of more experienced Exim developer oversight in reviewing commits, given the nature of the comment attached to the bad code:    Also: layer violation, a highly convenient language for configuration and a lack of tainting at the C level to catch this and scream, when untrusted data is inserted via %s formatting into a string which is then expanded with the full power of the configuration language.  Morally equivalent to "shell eval of header content".

This release is identical to except for the small change needed to plug the security hole.  The next release of Exim will, eventually, be which will include the many improvements we've made since but which will require the normal release candidate baking process before release.  You are not vulnerable unless you built Exim with EXPERIMENTAL_DMARC.  This issue is known by the CVE ID of was reported directly to the Exim development team by a company which uses Exim for its mail server.  An Exim developer constructed a small patch which altered the way the contents of the From header is parsed by converting it to use safer and better internal functions.  It was applied and tested on a production server for correctness.  We were notified of the vulnerability Friday night, created a patch on Saturday, applied and tested it on Sunday, notified OS packagers on Monday/Tuesday, and are releasing on the next available work day, which is Wednesday.  This is why we have made the smallest feasible changes to prevent exploit: we want this chagne to be as safe as possible to expedite into production (if the packages were built with DMARC).  _________________________________________________________________  The primary ftp server is in Cambridge, England.
