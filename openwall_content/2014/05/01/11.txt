I apologize but due to various reasons there will be no new versions released or further support for EZPZ OCB in the foreseeable future.  For a reliable, inexpensive alternative I recommend trying MyRepono and the MyRepono Plugin. This service, while not entirely free (the fees are as low as 2Â˘ a day for a small site), works great on WordPress sites as large as 5GB, maybe even larger. MyRepono gives a credit when signing up for the service so there is no cost to try it out.  Again, I apologize to all EZPZ One Click Backup users and wish you all the best.
