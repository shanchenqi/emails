Are there any other  > opinions on this?  If SECURE_NOROOT is meant to be usable to run entire Linux distros (whether "on host" or/and "in containers"), then it must not have an effect of excluding UID 0 from "appropriate privileges" for setuid(2).  Do we know reliably that in this case excluding UID 0 from "appropriate privileges" for setuid(2) was an effect specifically of SECURE_NOROOT? If so, yes, it sounds like it needs to be fixed, and this detail needs to be documented.  Do any implementations of containers, such as LXC, rely on SECURE_NOROOT?  If so, it sounds like they might have extra local root vulnerabilities (for in-container user to in-container root) as a result of this issue.  I also suggest that distros don't make things like seunshare available to non-administrator users by default, because these expand the attack surface even if an attempt is made to make them safe.  Only a subset of systems will benefit from having this functionality exposed by default, whereas all systems will suffer from the expanded attack surface.
