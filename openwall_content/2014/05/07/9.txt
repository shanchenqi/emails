The pattern of *action doesn't seem to popular, in fact searching github shows _0_ occurrence of "*action" in ruby code (lots of occurrences in non ruby code). So either this pattern is never used or GitHub is blocking that specific search term for Ruby, which doesn't seem to be the case, or it's incredibly rare.  So yeah knowing the other vectors would be good!
