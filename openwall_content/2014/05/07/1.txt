In that case, blocking mail from bob@...om wouldn't accomplish anything. But it's conceivable that the a.com administrator would start blocking the IP address of the b.com SMTP server.  That's a detail that doesn't have much effect on the CVE inclusion question.  Originating a new message to report non-delivery is valid according to RFC section 6.1. It's not really the case that there's inherently an integrity impact.  There could be a Postfix developer announcement that, according to their security policy, this is unintended behavior with an integrity impact. A CVE assignment would be possible in that case.  (To summarize: just because the RFC section 6.1 behavior is allowed doesn't mean that it's a good idea. An SMTP server should minimize the situations in which outsiders can trigger an arbitrary volume of outbound SMTP traffic to arbitrary destination IP addresses. Non-deliverability should be detected within the original SMTP dialog, and this case of the Delivered-To: header doesn't seem impossible to detect. However, there might be some type of architectural motivation for not checking the Delivered-To: header within the original SMTP dialog. Even if it was originally intentional, the developer might accept a feature request to change it.)  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =Xmjk -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
