I checked into a variety of programs using embedded copies of various things like XML/etc. Also other programs that use hashing for stuff, one of which is DBus.  The bad news: DBus has a vulnerable hash implementation  The good news: there doesn't appear to be many (any?) ways to inject data easily to trigger this vulnerability.  So I don't think this needs a CVE since it isn't really trigger-able, but posted this more as a reminder that hash DoS vulns are probably still lurking in various places.  With thanks to Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team who did the actual code audit bits.   - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =9i7N -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
