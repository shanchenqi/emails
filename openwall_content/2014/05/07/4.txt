We've been looking at this closely here at Heroku, and as far as we can tell it's only the original vector (*action/:action). What are we missing here?  We'd like to be better able to evaluate if we're vulnerable -- and, more importantly, we'd like to understand if this is a big enough deal for us to notify our customers and directly encourage them to upgrade (a step we've taken in the past). However, without more details about these "additional vectors" we're kinda shooting in the dark. Can you share more details?  Thanks!
