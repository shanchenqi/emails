There is currently no fix, but as the ntpd issue has been gaining some interest, I'm bringing this up here now for other who may ship chrony.  We assigned it  I noticed this as well when reviewing chrony quite a while ago, but I  did not press the issue because its restricted to localhost by default  and the amplification factor is low, especially in packet count terms.  At the time, I did not consider it comparable to the ntpd issue at all,  and I still don't.  Comparable levels of amplification are present in TCP itself and many  other UDP-based protocols.  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
