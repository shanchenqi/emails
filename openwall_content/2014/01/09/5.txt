A local attacker could use this flaw to perform a symbolic link attack to modify an arbitrary file accessible to the user running flite, or possibly obtain sensitive information as the temporary file may contain text-to-speech output (screen contents).  The issue is here:  src/audio/auserver.c contains:  static int play_wave_from_socket(snd_header *header,int audiostream) { âŚ fff = cst_fopen("/tmp/awb.wav",CST_OPEN_WRITE|CST_OPEN_BINARY); âŚ n = audio_write(audio_device,shorts,q); cst_fwrite(fff,shorts,2,q);  As this is debugging functionality and never read by flite, the fix is  just to ifdef the lines out...  A patch is available from   Cheers,  -- Murray McAllister / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
