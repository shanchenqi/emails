It is intended  for cross-domain applications, but it fails to achieve that goal because  it uses Storable, which is known to be insecure when deserializing  (thawing) untrusted data.  User name and password are transmitted using  Storable, so code execution can happen before authentication.  The cryptographic hook built into PlRPC is limited: there is no MAC, no  reply protection, and there's just a symmetric group key shared by all  users.  It's not really PlRPC's fault, considering its age.   PlRPC mainly lives on because it is a dependency of DBD::Proxy, which is  carried around by the DBI module.  This might warrant two CVE assignments (one for the Storable-based code  execution), and one for the weak crypto.  This was first reported in   The patches that exist just document the issues and are not real  fixes (for Storable itself, there is only a documentation fix, so this  has precedent).  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
