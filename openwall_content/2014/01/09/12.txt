The development version also supports TMUX_TMPDIR in which sockets are created without a subdirectory and which e.g. may be set to XDG_RUNTIME_DIR. The Debian patch makes tmux potentially less secure due to being setgid and it was rejected by upstream, see In Debian reverted to the upstream behavior and no longer carries the patch referenced in the above bug report. --  Guido Berhoerster  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
