The same choice was made in net/core/iovec.c (a file that you didn't ask about).  >  -> net/socket.c  Lack of "msg_namelen = 0" statements is not something that would really be considered a vulnerability in the previous net/socket.c implementation. From the perspective of net/socket.c itself, the "msg_namelen = 0" additions are a design improvement that can contribute to the security of other code.  >  -> net/rxrpc/ar-recvmsg.c  The complete absence of a "msg_namelen =" statement in the unpatched code seems to be a bug, but it's not the same as updating msg_namelen in an uninitialized-data situation.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =mqWd -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
