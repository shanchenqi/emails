This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that a module must be  enabled that relies on the Entity property access API and it must be  configured to expose either comment, user or node statistics properties.  One example would be the RESTful Web Services module (RESTWS) with the  permission configured to access the comment, user or node resource for  untrusted web service consumers.  2) Entity list property access bypass  The module's entity wrapper access API doesn't sufficiently check entity  access on referenced entities such as taxonomy terms. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that a module must be  enabled that uses the access() method of entity metadata wrappers to  determine access to a property which references multiple entities to  which access is not granted. One example would be the RESTful Web  Services module (RESTWS) with respectively configured permissions on an  entity property or (entity reference) field, for example a list of  (unaccessible) referenced user entities on a node entity.  3) Unpublished comments access bypass  The module's entity_access() API doesn't protect unpublished comments  from being viewed by unprivileged users. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact a module must be enabled  which uses the provided entity access API on comments and the comment  module must be enabled.
