For example,  and are fixed in the same version and are the same type: "updates a certain length value without ensuring that an associated data structure has been initialized."  However, we had information that these files were introduced to the kernel at different times.  While we don't list a specific minimum-version in the description, it's apparent that each affects a slightly different range of kernel versions.  also comes from the same commit, but it's a length inconsistency, so on the surface it's a different vuln type than the others, which could be characterized as a length-calculation and/or initialization error.  - Steve   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
