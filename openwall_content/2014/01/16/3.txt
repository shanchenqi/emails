Use for the vulnerability in the Taxonomy module. The other information seems to have at least two possible interpretations. One interpretation is that this vulnerability in the Taxonomy module affects whether it is safe for other modules to have these "similar lists." A second interpretation is that "tagged with a particular taxonomy term" means that the attack involves a crafted taxonomy term. In this second interpretation, a custom or contributed module may require its own vulnerability fix to block the crafted taxonomy term. In that situation, each contributed module may require its own CVE ID, because those issues would not be within the scope of    > 3) Security hardening (Form API - Drupal 7 - Not critical) > To facilitate this, a new, optional  > $form_state['programmed_bypass_access_check'] element has been added  There is no CVE for the action of adding this functionality to Drupal core.  > provides a method for custom or contributed code to fix security  > issues that would be difficult or impossible to fix otherwise.  If contributed code uses this element to address a vulnerability, each such vulnerability may be eligible for a CVE ID.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =1RjG -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
