We've declined making assignments for those. One of the criteria we're currently using is:    - cases in which a vendor of a UDP protocol implementation announces     that they made a security-relevant mistake by having configuration     or code elements that allow amplification attacks, and publishes     a fix for this mistake  One of the other CVE Numbering Authorities was also receiving similar reports. We coordinated with them and learned that they were looking at CVE eligibility in much the same way.  The "in which a vendor of a UDP protocol implementation" above was what we had for the ntpd issue (with some definition of "announces"). We don't know the ultimate outcome of how amplification attacks will interact with the scope of CVE, but we did want to point out that this assignment seemed inconsistent with what we've been doing.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =S4od -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
