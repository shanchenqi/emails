There are many UDP protocols in which the reply traffic is larger than the request traffic. A vendor can handle this in several possible ways, including (for example) a statement that the protocol implementation details were intentional, and that adverse effects are a network-operations problem, not a software problem. CVE is about software mistakes. So, at least at the moment, we are looking for vendors who characterize the issue as a software mistake, and fix it.  In the chronyd case, this seems likely, so we don't expect any long-term issue with including in CVE.  There may well be other reasonable approaches. An example approach might be making CVE assignments for any protocol implementation that's similar to one that already has a CVE (e.g., similar to ntpd). We're not currently using that approach.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJS2dYfAAoJEKllVAevmvmsCpcH/AlwpzADNsdZtfJsvLBontoq =Qby5 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
