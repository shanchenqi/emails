I have evidence that the vulnerability can be used in at least one F/LOSS integrated library system, Koha, to perform an application-level privilege escalation, and another one, Evergreen, is likely vulnerable to disclosure of the contents of arbitrary files on the server.  I am a committer to both of those projects.
