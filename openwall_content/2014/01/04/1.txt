The motivation for the CVE assignment isn't that the end result is ECB.  To try to make this slightly more general, we'll mention two scenarios in which a vendor writes some code, and the code has a certain characteristic for which the outcome is weaker security.  Scenario A: Based on analysis of the code itself, one can reasonably conclude that the vendor WAS NOT trying to have that characteristic.  Scenario B: Based on analysis of subject-matter references, one can reasonably conclude that the vendor SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN trying to have that characteristic.  We've written longer explanations here in the past, but: to a first-order approximation, CVE assignment is MOSTLY about Scenario A.  Flippant example of Scenario B: the code calls ROT13 once.  Flippant example of Scenario A: because of a logic error, the code calls ROT13 twice.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJSx2TEAAoJEKllVAevmvmsgbwIAIhNUKwcOestofrbZDiTtET6 =GxjR -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
