The bugs fixed by the following commit basically allow remote code execution when uscan is used to download upstream's tarball. With and without repacking (contrary to the commit message).   This was assigned  Two other changes were made that IMO should be considered as hardening:  At least I'm not aware of a way to exploit them.
