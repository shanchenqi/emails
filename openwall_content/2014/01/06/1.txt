[0]   Looking trough the git repository at [1], there is at least [2] which seems to indicate the fix for the 5.2.x branch (I cannot say tough if this the complete one).   [1] https://github.com/movabletype/movabletype  [2]  Debian Bugtracker reference is at [3].   [3]  Is there enough information to identify the vulnerability and to get a CVE assigned for this issue?
