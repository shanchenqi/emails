It could occur while setting or retrieving socket options via setsockopt(2) or getsockopt(2) calls. Though a user needs to have CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges to perform these IP_VS operations.  Upstream fix: -------------    -> ===  The bounds check added by the above patch are found to be redundant, as the  same is done in routine 'nf_sockopt_find'. [1]     + if (cmd < IP_VS_BASE_CTL || cmd > IP_VS_SO_SET_MAX)    +     return -EINVAL;    + if (len < 0 || len > MAX_ARG_LEN)    +     return -EINVAL;  [1]   That makes it a security non-issue. Please kindly reject this CVE.
