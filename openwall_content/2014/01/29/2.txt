Pointed out by Mark Dowd  As I understand it this can be enabled via code edit/gcc command line options, so not sure if this qualified for a CVE or not (vuln in code, yes, is code reachable? not under any default setup, and even on non-default you have to go pretty far off to enable it).  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  bClWQdKuzSxlPrjIp7AT =dkva -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
