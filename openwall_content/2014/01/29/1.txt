The github commit in the original  message is in php-horde-Horde-Util for us.  The same vulnerability is in our horde package too, but I could not find  this in github:  21 class Variables { 22 23     var $_vars; 24     var $_expectedVariables = array(); 25 26     function Variables($vars = array()) 27     { 28         if (is_null($vars)) { 29             $vars = Util::dispelMagicQuotes($_REQUEST); 30         } 31         if (isset($vars['_formvars'])) { 32             $this->_expectedVariables = @unserialize($vars['_formvars']); 33             unset($vars['_formvars']); 34         } 35         $this->_vars = $vars;  Mailing here in case anyone else is shipping in a similar way (or if  another CVE is needed?).
