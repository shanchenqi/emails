An impact on the default installation isn't necessary. Vulnerabilities that occur only after the user modifies code aren't eligible for a CVE. However, if there's some type of "installation option" mentioned by the vendor, someone may have chosen that option, and it may be worthwhile to track the issue with a CVE. The nature of an "installation option" obviously varies widely across both open-source and closed-source products.  In this case, there's:  > http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.bin/ssh/Makefile.inc  > Add support for an experimental zero-knowledge password authentication > method using the J-PAKE protocol ...  > This is experimental, work-in-progress code and is presently > compiled-time disabled (turn on -DJPAKE in Makefile.inc).  >  > #CFLAGS+=	-DJPAKE  This is close to the edge of what "installation option" means, but our feeling is that the vendor wouldn't have provided that #CFLAGS line at all unless it were expected that an end user might want to make the one-character change.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =Br7x -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
