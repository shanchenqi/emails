We've filed a bug [1] and it's also been brought up upstream [2].  There is currently no fix, but as the ntpd issue has been gaining some interest, I'm bringing this up here now for other who may ship chrony.  We assigned it  [1] [2]  Thanks.  --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
