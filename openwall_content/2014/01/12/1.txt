One some architectures, privilege escalation under non-common circumstances is possible, POC for escalation via shmem_xattr_handlers is available for about 5 days.  See [1] for information about discovery, exploitation, [2] about LKML discussion, [3] for patch.  hd  [1] [2] [3]  - --  http://www.halfdog.net/ PGP: AE98 B91F FE88  2BD8 feed a bee -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =ObvK -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
