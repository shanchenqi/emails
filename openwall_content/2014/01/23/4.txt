ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  When setting up the IRQ for a passed through physical device, a flaw in the error handling could result in a memory allocation being used after it is freed, and then freed a second time.  This would typically result in memory corruption.  IMPACT ======  Malicious guest administrators can trigger a use-after-free error, resulting in hypervisor memory corruption.  The effects of memory corruption could be anything, including a host-wide denial of service, or privilege escalation.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen 4.2.x and later are vulnerable. Xen 4.1.x and earlier are not vulnerable.  Only systems making use of device passthrough are vulnerable.  Only systems with a 64-bit hypervisor configured to support more than CPUs or with a 32-bit hypervisor configured to support more than 64 CPUs are vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  This issue can be avoided by not assigning PCI devices to untrusted guests on systems supporting Intel VT-d or AMD Vi.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Coverity Scan, prompted by modelling improvements contributed by Andrew Coooper.  The issue was diagnosed by Matthew Daley and Andrew Coooper.  The patch was prepared by Andrew Cooper.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.  xsa83.patch                 Xen 4.2.x, Xen 4.3.x, xen-unstable  $ xsa83*.patch  xsa83.patch $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment "xsa83.patch" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
