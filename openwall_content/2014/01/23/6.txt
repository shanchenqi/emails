Is anyone else in here convinced?  (Genuine question.)  I'm not convinced. There's a three digit number of Debian-derived distros  and many of them come and go. The oldest Qlustar advisory is less than  a year old and there's no visible participation in any security processes.  We maintain the http://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/kernel-sec/ repository which tracks all kernel vulnerabilities as soon as they're public. That's a good base for every Debian-derived distro with a modified kernel.
