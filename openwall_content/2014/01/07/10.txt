Hm, if this warrants a CVE for lightdm, then gdm3 needs one also:     Basically, when gdm3 is configured to not show a list of users (but instead shows a blank box for the login prompt), if the user clicks "cancel" or hits the escape key, then the greeter gets put into a mode without any way to log in (no prompts available).  I've tried to debug it but it appears to be due to some sort of timing-dependent case.  When i step through the code with gdb, i haven't been able to reproduce the issue.  It is definitely a bad situation for machines in public locations with this configuration.  	--dkg   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
