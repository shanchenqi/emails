Even though Hafez's posting reads a bit too much like an ad (yet does not include e.g. a table of contents for the magazine issue, which could have been helpful), the magazine does have some relevant content:  On Tue, Jan 07, at Hafez Kamal wrote: > Download Issue #10 - http://magazine.hackinthebox.org/hitb-magazine.html  The MongoDB article is based on Mikhail Firstov's materials first presented at ZeroNights  On page 26 of:   there is what was a minor zero-day back then (almost 14 months ago), and which I'm afraid was never handled as such.  This is in part my fault, as I dropped the ball on the e-mail exchange with Mikhail, trying to turn this into a CVE request on oss-security.  I guess better late than never, so:  There is a memory over-read bug that can be used by an authenticated user (if applicable) to obtain raw MongoDB server process memory contents via incorrect BSON object length.  I guess that under most deployments this does not cross a security boundary, but for some it could (differently-privileged MongoDB users, data already deleted from the DB yet staying in process memory, or/and metadata that is not normally retrievable).  I don't know if the bug has since been fixed or not, nor if it possibly already has a CVE ID by now.
