However, in this case there has not been any actual code to delete the user in this controller (user deletion is handled elsewhere in a separate admin section). The effect of the "  , :except => [:index, :destroy]" commit was simply to tighten up the routes, rather than leaving exposed a route that didn't actually perform a delete function.  Hope that makes sense. Let me know if you have any other outstanding questions.
