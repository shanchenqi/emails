UTF-16 encoding combined with Blowfish's  64 bit block size means there are just four password characters per  block.  Encryption is convergent as well.  This may enable recovery of  passwords through codebook attacks.  Should we treat this as a minor vulnerability?  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
