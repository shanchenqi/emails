This blog posting from already describes the attack: https://www.securepla.net/using-ntp-to-enumerate-client-ips/  | ADDITIONAL ATTACKS | HD Moore also discussed that he had figured out a way to DDoS a | system using NTP with very minimal requests.  Although he has not | released data on this type of DDoS, we put our heads together here | on what the attack could be.  When you make a monlist request, you | send 1 udp packet to the NTP server and responses are returned. | We think that using this request against all the NTP servers and | peers, you could send hundreds of thousands of UDP packets to a | victim with minimal request packets.  By spoofing the source address | and requesting monlists repetitively, all responses from those NTP | servers will be forwarded to the victim.
