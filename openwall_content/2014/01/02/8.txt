At this point, it seems very unlikely that the issue will have an additional CVE assignment. We were asking just because of the possibility of a clear implementation error in which security was weakened by using a "wrong" character width.  > Do you think MITRE or other folks should be recommending pre-whitening > the strings before encrypting them  It's possible that a group elsewhere at MITRE would work on recommendations in that area or other areas. For purposes of the CVE assignments in this situation, that type of opportunity for security improvement wasn't being considered.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =YscU -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
