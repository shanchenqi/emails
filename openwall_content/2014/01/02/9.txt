Christey" <coley@...re.org> To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: Re: Duplicated CVE assignment for bip   Moritz,  These are two slightly different issues, although a casual reading of the  descriptions does not make that sufficiently clear.  The original CNA assignment of did not consider that there  appear to be two different types of issues, which means a SPLIT of the CVE  ID.  The issues are disclosed in Bug here:   The first issue is that Bip will write to arbitrary sockets when run in  daemon mode because stderr is closed: "when using SSL (client_side_ssl =  true), bip will write an error to stderr when the SSL handshake fails.  However, if it is running as a daemon, stderr will have been closed."  We narrowed the scope of to this first issue.  Note that  while the bug was apparently filed and public in it was given a  ID, but we don't usually reject an ID simply because it is  out of sync with the disclosure date.  We also didn't see a need to REJECT  this CVE because of the scope change either, since it's in reasonably wide  use.  The second issue covers connections that are never closed: "Also, when an  SSL handshake error occurs, a socket is never closed, but remains in  CLOSE_WAIT state forever. This happens because a socket that is set to  have an error will never be closed."  A fix for the first issue would not necessarily guarantee a fix of the  second issue, and the bugs are of different types.  Therefore the second  issue is SPLIT from the first.  We assigned accordingly,  since at the time of assignment, we knew that was the disclosure  date.  When we published these CVEs, we probably should have notified  oss-security, or at least modified and  descriptions to reflect the close relationships.  I apologize for that.  - Steve   On Thu, 2 Jan Moritz Muehlenhoff wrote:  > Hi, > Seems there's a duplicated CVE ID for bip: > and > refer > to the same bugreport. > > Since was used for much longer, should > be rejected? > > Cheers, >        Moritz >  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
