Phusion Passenger creates a "server instance directory" in /tmp during startup, which is a temporary directory that Phusion Passenger uses to store working files. This directory is deleted after Phusion Passenger exits. For various technical reasons, this directory must have a semi-predictable filename. If a local attacker can predict this filename, and precreates a symlink with the same filename that points to an arbitrary directory with mode owner root and group root, then the attacker will succeed in making Phusion Passenger write files and create subdirectories inside that target directory. The following files/subdirectories are created:  * control_process.pid * generation-X, where X is a number.  If you happen to have a file inside the target directory called `control_process.pid`, then that file's contents are overwritten.  These files and directories are deleted during Phusion Passenger exit. The target directory itself is not deleted, nor are any other contents inside the target directory, although the symlink is.   It is fixed in upstream version   References:   --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
