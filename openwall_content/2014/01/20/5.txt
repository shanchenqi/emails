Use for the default configuration in which the external network interface is used with no access control for reading queued music files.  These could have been fixed independently. For example, fixing only means that a remote attacker could read "private" song data (but that might be irrelevant in some situations on a network within a home). Fixing only means that local users could read arbitrary files (but that might be irrelevant on a single-user system).  The other issues mentioned in are probably best considered suggestions for security improvement (e.g., availability of an HTTP service in fewer circumstances, defaulting to the lo interface, better access control, additional build options, etc.).  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =Arrv -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
