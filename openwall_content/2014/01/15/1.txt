In this situation, the cost of having two CVEs outweighs any possible benefit, so we've proceeded to make the change to a single CVE as follows:  > Use for this issue in which the product does not check > whether the connection is still open. This corresponds to > which apparently would be of > some value in some attack scenarios.  > Use for this issue in which the product does not > properly check whether the connection is still open. This corresponds > to which apparently is of > value in additional attack scenarios.  Both of these issues are now within the scope of has been REJECTed - it will appear at in the coming days with a brief explanation and a pointer back to   We wanted to clarify one point about CVE assignment by MITRE. The comments mentioned "Neither of those versions is released" and "the hourly builds are NOT supported releases." The guidance we currently provide to our CVE Numbering Authority participants is that assignments should only be for vulnerabilities in software that was "made generally available to the vendor's customers." This guidance does not include any restrictions on whether a vulnerability's context is in a release, or on whether any support is offered for vulnerability remediation. For example, beta software has been explicitly in scope for the past 14 years.  > GIT snapshots do not count as end user packaged releases - if you were > to take that view, then every single git commit would have be > considered a 'package' since gitweb has a link to download a .zip of > any revision.  The distinction is that downloads.html says "should be usable" but a gitweb page with a .zip link typically doesn't say that. Admittedly, the distinction may be practically irrelevant in the specific case of libvirt-git-snapshot.tar.gz. You understand your customers, but we don't understand your customers. If a new vulnerability were introduced in one snapshot and fixed in the next snapshot, you might have very good information that there's nobody at all who would even want to track that vulnerability.  One challenge for us is that not all codebases are the same. For this FFmpeg issue:      people might think the CVE is largely useless because no release was affected. However, some well-known third parties use git snapshots of FFmpeg. The end result is that the vulnerable code either was shipped to many, many end users -- or else it was "almost" shipped to those end users except that a delay caused a sufficiently later snapshot to be used instead.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =2K5m -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
