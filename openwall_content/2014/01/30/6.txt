The Enlightenment window manager (enlightenment.org) was found to ship with (a) a setuid root helper that did not effectively sanitize its environment and (b) a weak default configuration. Users in select groups could exploit this to execute arbitrary programs as root.  This was fixed upstream in 3 commits each for both e17 and e18 branches, with two new releases shipped shortly after:   Dec  4th [1], [2], [3]   Dec 21st [4], [5], [6]  Fedora has a bug filed against it at [7] referencing the e18 commits.  Thanks,  Martin.  [1]  [2]  [3]  [4] [5] [6] [7]     Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
