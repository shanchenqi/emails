Author: Larry W. Cashdollar, @_larry0  Download: http://rubygems.org/gems/echor  Description: Echo ruby wrapper  Vulnerability in file The function perform_request passes sensitive data to the shell and unsanitized user input, if this gem is used in a rails application a user could get remote command injection simply by putting a semi-colon in their username or password. At a minimum a local user can steal the login credentials just by watching the process table on the system.   45     def perform_request(data)  46       JSON.parse(`curl -u  {Echo.backplane_user}: {Echo.backplane_password}     --data-binary '#{data}' #{@...nnel}`)  47     end  Vendor: Not notified, I don't think this Gem is maintained anymore.
