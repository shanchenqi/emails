This is not a very frequent question, but I've seen this sort of confusion several times, in different places.  I don't know if it's addressed in some sort of FAQ list.  I think there's room for improvement for the language used on CVE ID pages like , which currently says:  "Date Entry Created Disclaimer: The entry creation date may reflect when the CVE-ID was allocated or reserved, and does not necessarily indicate when this vulnerability was discovered, shared with the affected vendor, publicly disclosed, or updated in CVE."  but follows this with:  "Phase (Legacy) Assigned  I'm not surprised the latter continues to confuse people, as it appears not to fall under the disclaimer.  I think the disclaimer should be worded such that it'd clearly apply to "Phase (Legacy) \n Assigned" as well.  (And even then some confusion will remain, just maybe less of it.)
