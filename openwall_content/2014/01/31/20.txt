"""      def __init__(self, command):         outfile = tempfile.mktemp()         errfile = tempfile.mktemp()         self.status = os.system("( %s ) >%s 2>%s" %                                 (command, outfile, errfile)) >> 8         self.out = open(outfile, "r").read()         self.err = open(errfile, "r").read()         os.remove(outfile)         os.remove(errfile)   tempfile.mktemp() should be replaced with tempfile.mkstemp() as it is documented as insecure.   I don't believe a CVE has been requested for this already.  Can one be assigned please?
