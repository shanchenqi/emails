Yup, was good for us too, so we could double-check that the proposed fix from your mail is working OK for others as well, since it hasn't arrived in the kernel.org stable-queue git yet. By the way, Ubuntu used the longer original patch, which we used [1] in the end as well (saw too late that Linus already committed the shorter one).  Coming back to our earlier discussion about linux-distros membership [2]: It definitely helped being on the list. Since the patch was trivial, we didn't suffer a significant time delay compared to other distros. In case of more complicated patches, this could have gotten tough though given the fact that the new builds need a significant amount of testing as well.  It would be nice, if we (and others in a similar boat) could get a head-start of at least a couple of days (that's how I understood your question in [2]). Maybe a "second-class citizen" list could complement the linux-distros list with notifications slightly earlier than on oss-security.
