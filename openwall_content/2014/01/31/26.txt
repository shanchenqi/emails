Google is offering bounties for responsible disclosure of bugs in Google's software, and I guess this includes use of Linux kernel by Chromium OS.  (I don't know if this specific vulnerability was relevant to Google's products, but I wouldn't be surprised if Google is generous enough to pay a bounty anyway.)  On a related note, Google is also offering bounties for security enhancements to some Open Source projects once such enhancements are accepted upstream.  This includes Linux kernel and many more:   ... but finding a vulnerability would probably not fall under the latter program.
