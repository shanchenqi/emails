These have been fixed in the new version, which you can get at .  One is an arbitrary file deletion and the other is two cross site scripting issues. Note that I was unable to exploit the XSS issues due to the inbuilt protection module, so I'm not sure if it qualifies for a CVE.  The tickets containing the information are available here   Unfortunately I can't paste the full report in this email as the Android Gmail client will mangle it. Please see the text file at more details.  Thanks in advance,  and thanks to the ImpressCMS team for being so responsive.
