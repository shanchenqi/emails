Hello,  Is a CVE needed for versions of libotr that support OTR v1? Quoting the  Debian bug[1]:  "" as you are surely aware of, it's been known [1] since that clients supporting both OTRv1 and v2 (such as libotr 3.x) are subject to protocol downgrade attacks clients. It's also been known for a while that OTRv1 has serious security issues (that were the main reason for a v2, actually). In short, support v2 only is the only safe way to go these days.
