Pretty sure, yes.  I am not aware of a reason to think otherwise.  It was kindly assigned by Petr Matousek (of Red Hat, even though their products are not affected) on Wed, 29 Jan  > It was assigned already beginning of Dec. last year.  The "assigned" date seen on CVE IDs often indicates when a pool of CVE IDs was created and then assigned to a CNA (Red Hat in this case), not when individual CVE IDs are assigned to actual issues.  It is perfectly normal (albeit confusing) for the "assigned" date to be earlier than the vulnerability discovery date.  This was discussed in here before:   CNAs:  http://cve.mitre.org/cve/cna.html  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
