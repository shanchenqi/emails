CVE assignment for the XSS issues requires that there is a possible configuration in which the issues are exploitable. (If they are not exploitable, but the vendor made applicable code changes anyway for security hardening, a CVE assignment won't be made.)  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =YGh+ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
