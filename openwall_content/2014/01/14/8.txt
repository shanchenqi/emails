Agreed, there is only one single issue here. GIT snapshots do not count as end user packaged releases - if you were to take that view, then every single git commit would have be considered a 'package' since gitweb has a link to download a .zip of any revision. Clearly that ways lies insanity.  > However, since you have already assigned both numbers, we can go ahead > and use them :(  It makes no sense for us to use 2 distinct CVEs for this. There is only one single issue we're going to document and manage here. Just use the first assigned  and discard  Regards, Daniel --  |: http://berrange.com      -o-    http://www.flickr.com/photos/dberrange/ :| |: http://libvirt.org              -o-             http://virt-manager.org :| |: http://autobuild.org       -o-         http://search.cpan.org/~danberr/ :| |: http://entangle-photo.org       -o-       http://live.gnome.org/gtk-vnc :|  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
