But the symptoms of the issue are identical (you either have the connection issue, or you don't, and it wasn't until the second patch that you get rid of the connection issue).  But this is no different to other cases of fixing bugs in unreleased code.  >  > 3. http://libvirt.org/downloads.html says "Once an hour, an automated > snapshot is made from the git server source tree.

No, the hourly builds are NOT supported releases; we can update the downloads.html page to explicitly mention that they are to be used at own risk.  However, since you have already assigned both numbers, we can go ahead and use them :(  --  Eric Blake   eblake redhat com    Libvirt virtualization library http://libvirt.org   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
