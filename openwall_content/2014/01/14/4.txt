Qlustar is a Ubuntu/Debian based distro targeted at HPC/Storage/Cloud clusters. We use our own kernels (typically based on vanilla) since many years, but have the need to supply timely security fixes to our users. So far we have to wait for other distros to come out with their announcements and then start analyzing the fixes they have done. This leaves us/our users with a vulnerability window that is way too large,  Please let me know what are the requirements to be included in the list.  Thanks,  Roland  ---- Roland Fehrenbacher, PhD Founder/CEO Q-Leap Networks GmbH Tel. : EMail: rf@...eap.com http://www.q-leap.com / http://qlustar.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
