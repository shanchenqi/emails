Use for this issue in which the product does not properly check whether the connection is still open. This corresponds to which apparently is of value in additional attack scenarios.  In deciding to SPLIT, all of these factors were considered but we don't want to try to precisely specify whether any one factor would be sufficient on its own:  1. There seem to be two distinct version-like identifiers, and which can be interpreted as different affected versions.  2. The first patch alone was accepted in the and messages.  3. http://libvirt.org/downloads.html says "Once an hour, an automated snapshot is made from the git server source tree. These snapshots should be usable." This suggests that a "version" with only the first patch was, in some realistic sense, "packaged for distribution," and could conceivably be in use somewhere.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =9kpY -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
