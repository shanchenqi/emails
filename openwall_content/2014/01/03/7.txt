The function in question is in the client code for the Remote Desktop Protocol Licensing Extension described on the web page. The code is part of the reading of a Server License Request packet. The integer overflow affects a malloc argument. After this, the client would normally make separate malloc calls and write (a potentially very large amount of) data from the server into that separately malloced memory. Effects depend on the malloc implementation and the architecture. Even if code execution were essentially impossible, other conceivable security impacts exist. For example, the client might later send unintended private information (license data for a different server?) over the connection to the current server.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_remote_desktop_software says "Multiple sessions ... Yes" but we don't know whether that refers to FreeRDP 1.x or FreeRDP 0.x (which is a different codebase and allowed the user to start multiple sessions with a single command as described in the post). If one server can send a crafted Server License Request packet that causes memory corruption and leads to a crash of multiple sessions, a CVE ID can be assigned. (The crash could perhaps not happen immediately, and instead happen after the user established important state in a session to a non-malicious server.)  Even without that, a CVE ID seems probably worthwhile for the largely unpredictable client behavior after the erroneous malloc call.
