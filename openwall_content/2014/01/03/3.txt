The server's documentation [2] mentions the following.  "By default, the Neo4j Server comes with some places where arbitrary code code execution can happen. These are the Section âTraversalsâ REST endpoints. To secure these, either disable them completely by removing offending plugins from the server class-path, or secure access to these URLs through proxies or Authorization Rules."  This could mean that the RCE itself is not CVE worthy as it is a documented/expected behavior. However, should the CSRF flaw be considered a vulnerability and assigned a CVE?
