ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The PHYSDEVOP_{prepare,release}_msix operations are supposed to be available to privileged guests (domain 0 in non-disaggregated setups) only, but the necessary privilege check was missing.  IMPACT ======  Malicious or misbehaving unprivileged guests can cause the host or other guests to malfunction. This can result in host-wide denial of service. Privilege escalation, while seeming to be unlikely, cannot be excluded.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen and as well as and later are vulnerable. Xen and as well as and earlier are not vulnerable.  Only PV guests can take advantage of this vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only HVM guests will avoid this issue.  There is no mitigation available for PV guests.  NOTE REGARDING LACK OF EMBARGO ==============================  This issue was disclosed publicly on the xen-devel mailing list.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.     xen-unstable, Xen 4.3.x             Xen 4.2.x             Xen 4.1.x  $ xsa87*.patch    $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =morx -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
