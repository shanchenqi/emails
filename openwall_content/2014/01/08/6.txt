I wouldn't be so certain.  :)  I've gotten dot files in email a fair bit while working on free software projects since it's a really useful way of expressing dependency trees and similar structures.  So the possibility of a targetted exploit is there, particularly given that mailing list traffic is generally completely unauthenticated.  It's not hard for someone to pretend to be another participant and mail a doctored dot file to a development team.  The deception would probably be discovered reasonably quickly, but possibly not before damage was done.  --  Russ Allbery (eagle@...ie.org)              <http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/>  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
