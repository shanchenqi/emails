I strongly believe that it should have been implemented this way from the start. Can anyone argument why making the import of functions explicit might be unwanted in any use case?  Importing implicitly looks to me like buying powdered drugs from anonymous shady street dealers - there's a slim chance you might get what you wanted, but the odds (& esp. implications) of getting something toxic "from your environment" are most probably higher.  best regards, Bernhard Hermann   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
