You can set both variable and export function with same name. $ f () { a; } $ export -f f $ export f=3 $ echo $f 3 $ ksh $ cat /proc/$$/environ|xargs -0 -n1|grep -w f f=3 f=() {  a $ echo $f 3  SUS says storing two environment varianles with same name is undefined behavour:  2. Bash partially hides environment variable holding function: $ f () { a; } $ export -f f $ echo $f [ nothing ]  Both things above look like good grounds for hackers.
