Filter   <style> elements; normalize style elements and attributes before   filtering; add checks for attributes that contain css; add unit tests   for html5sec and reported bugs.  If anyone wants to discuss if this is a real vulnerability, I think it is: Including malicious CSS by less-privileged users could lead to UI manipulation which could cause a more-privileged user to do actions like giving the less-prived user more privs.   Upstream Bug:  Code commit:  Please assign a CVE.  cu, --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
