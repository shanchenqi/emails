These could all be done by having the process with root privileges inherit them from a daemon parent that already has root, rather than requiring the kernel to elevate the privileges of a process via the setuid bit. This inherently eliminates all attacker control of the process's initial state and limits the input/attack surface to the communication channel clients have with the daemon (e.g. a single unix socket).  As a bonus, a kernel that completely lacks setuid/setgid support immediately allows you to do lots of other security/functionality enhancements, like allowing any process to chroot at any time, allowing bind-mount-like filters blocking/replacing a process's view of part of the filesystem, etc.  > I still think a large part of the answer is "consider it to be a serious > bug when a setuid/setgid tool does non-trivial things without first > filtering its attacker-controlled environment through a whitelist".  The problem with this is that the environmental state (I don't mean just env vars, but everything a process inherits) is not of fixed scope, but continually growing, and each new feature added is a potential channel through which an attacker controls the behavior of the setuid process.
