There were two issues fixed recently. Could you please assign a CVE to them?  Matthew Hawn found that libzmq (ZeroMQ/C++) did not validate the other party's security handshake properly, allowing a man-in-the-middle downgrade attack.  Code commit:  Matthew Hawn found that libzmq (ZeroMQ/C++) did not implement a uniqueness check on connection nonces, and the CurveZMQ RFC was ambiguous about nonce validation. This allowed replay attacks. Code commit:  Only ZMQ versions 4.0.x with x < 5 are affected. is about to be released.  Thanks,  Roland  ------- http://www.q-leap.com / http://qlustar.com           --- HPC / Storage / Cloud Linux Cluster OS ---  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
