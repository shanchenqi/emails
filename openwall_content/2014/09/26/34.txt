Since these patches look final and are updating the bash patchlevel number, is it OK for distros to use them as-is, with the patchlevel number update already?  They are not yet on ftp.gnu.org.  BTW, I notice that your earlier bash patch isn't there, either.  And while I am at it - thank you for providing detached signatures for bash patches!  This is something the VIM project fails at, whereas you do it right.  Appreciated!
