Yes, what I'm saying is that in that situation, we should blame the "some process", not bash. It is the "some process" that opted to act as a privilege boundary (by being setuid or whatever), so it should be responsible for taking extra care when it executes non-trivial code (e.g. bash) with its elevated privileges.
