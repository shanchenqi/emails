Using the two patches, and the one line eol-pushback.patch, I am  not able to reproduce what I expect should be happing with bash 4.2.  Should I be seeing a problem with the reproducers that were mentioned in an  earlier piece of this thread, either:  bash -c 'true <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF'  or  (for x in ; do echo "for x$x in ; do :"; done; for x in ; do  echo done ; done) > test-script.sh $ bash test-script.sh   The first one gives me a series of:  bash: line 1: warning: here-document at line 1 delimited by end-of-file (wanted  `EO')  But does not result in a segfault.. (perhaps my memory layout/allocations just  happen to be avoiding that)  And the test-script.sh runs w/o segfault or other error being present.. again  maybe I'm lucky?   (Or am I simply missing something in the reproducer steps?)
