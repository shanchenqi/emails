It'd open a whole bunch of security issues.  This could be an issue if you have a suid binary calling a script. There are even people writing howtos to do that to circumvent unix security measures. [1]  I don't know (and haven't tested) if this preserves env, but the point is: suid binaries shouldn't do stupid things. If they do that's their fault. There should be extra many security conscious eyes on setuid bins (we recently saw a memleak in a setuid bin causing trouble elsewhere [2]).  If you can pass any env var to a suid script and it executes something else you have a problem no matter what. LD_PRELOAD etc.  [1] http://www.tuxation.com/setuid-on-shell-scripts.html [2]  cu, --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
