If the server enables TLS client authentication using certificates (this is rare) and explicitly sets SessionTicketsDisabled to true in the tls.Config, then a malicious client can falsely assert ownership of any client certificate it wishes."  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/golang-nuts/eeOHNw_shwU/OHALUmroA5kJ  Could a CVE please be assigned to this issue?
