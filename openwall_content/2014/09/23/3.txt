ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The emulation of instructions which generate software interrupts fails to perform supervisor mode permission checks.  However these instructions are not usually handled by the emulator. Exceptions to this are - - when a memory operand (implicit for the affected instructions) lives   in (emulated or passed through) memory mapped IO space, - - in the case of guests running in 32-bit PAE mode, when such an   instruction is (in execution flow) within four instructions of one   doing a page table update, - - when an Invalid Opcode exception gets raised by a guest instruction,   and the guest then (likely maliciously) alters the instruction to   become one of the affected ones, - - when the guest is in real mode (in which case there are no privilege   checks anyway).  IMPACT ======  Malicious HVM guest user mode code may be able to crash the guest.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen versions from 3.3 onwards are vulnerable.  Only user processes in HVM guests can take advantage of this vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only PV guests will avoid this issue.  There is no mitigation available for HVM guests.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered Andrei Lutas at BitDefender and analyzed by Andrew Cooper at Citrix.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.         xen-unstable, Xen 4.4.x, Xen 4.3.x, Xen 4.2.x  $  $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =rTiy -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
