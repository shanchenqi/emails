Convert patch line endings from DOS to Unix style.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The emulation of the instructions HLT, LGDT, LIDT, and LMSW fails to perform supervisor mode permission checks.  However these instructions are not usually handled by the emulator. Exceptions to this are - - when the instruction's memory operand (if any) lives in (emulated or   passed through) memory mapped IO space, - - in the case of guests running in 32-bit PAE mode, when such an   instruction is (in execution flow) within four instructions of one   doing a page table update, - - when an Invalid Opcode exception gets raised by a guest instruction,   and the guest then (likely maliciously) alters the instruction to   become one of the affected ones.  Malicious guest user mode code may be able to leverage this to install e.g. its own Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT).  IMPACT ======  Malicious HVM guest user mode code may be able to crash the guest or escalate its own privilege to guest kernel mode.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen versions from at least 3.2.x onwards are vulnerable.  Older versions have not been inspected.  Only user processes in HVM guests can take advantage of this vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only PV guests will avoid this issue.  There is no mitigation available for HVM guests.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered Andrei Lutas at BitDefender and analyzed by Andrew Cooper at Citrix.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.         xen-unstable, Xen 4.4.x, Xen 4.3.x, Xen 4.2.x  $  $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =OoOJ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
