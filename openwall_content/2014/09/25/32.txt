I wanted to post this here.  We have found a few more issues (OOB memory access). Also I am posting  Florain's patch here which should fix the issue in a more deeper way  rather than just apply duct-tape.  Any feed back etc is welcome!   -------- Forwarded Message -------- Subject: Non-upstream patches for bash Date: Thu, 25 Sep From: Florian Weimer <fweimer@...hat.com> To: Huzaifa Sidhpurwala <huzaifas@...hat.com>, Joshua Bressers  <bressers@...hat.com>  Note that if you ship 4.3, you might want to reevaluate a decision to enable array variable import from the environment.  Internal analysis revealed two out-of-bounds array accesses in the bash parser.  This was also independently and privately reported by Todd Sabin <tsabin@...online.net>.  The redir_stack issue is this:  $ bash -c 'true <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF' bash: line 2: warning: here-document at line 2 delimited by end-of-file (wanted `EOF') bash: line 2: warning: here-document at line 2 delimited by end-of-file (wanted `EOF') bash: line 2: warning: here-document at line 2 delimited by end-of-file (wanted `EOF') bash: line 2: warning: here-document at line 2 delimited by end-of-file (wanted `EOF') bash: line 2: warning: here-document at line 2 delimited by end-of-file (wanted `EOF') bash: line 2: warning: here-document at line 2 delimited by end-of-file (wanted `EOF') bash: line 2: warning: here-document at line 2 delimited by end-of-file (wanted `EOF') bash: line 2: warning: here-document at line 2 delimited by end-of-file (wanted `EOF') bash: line 2: warning: here-document at line 2 delimited by end-of-file (wanted `EOF') bash: line 2: warning: here-document at line 2 delimited by end-of-file (wanted `EOF') bash: line 2: make_here_document: bad instruction type 33 Segmentation fault (core dumped)  The word_lineno issue is this (only visible with address sanitizer, but it's probably to come up with something better):  $ (for x in ; do echo "for x$x in ; do :"; done; for x in ; do echo done ; done) > test-script.sh $ bash test-script.sh  Both issues are fixed by the parser-oob patches.  I'm also including the function definition affix patch which has already been posted to oss-security.  (variables-affix-3.0.patch has only seen very light review and testing yet, but it's a fairly straightforward backport.)  You'll also want Chet's one-liner patch posted to oss-security.  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security      View attachment "parser-oob-4.2.patch" of type "text/x-patch" bytes)  View attachment "variables-affix-3.0.patch" of type "text/x-patch" bytes)  View attachment "parser-oob-3.2.patch" of type "text/x-patch" bytes)  View attachment "variables-affix-4.2.patch" of type "text/x-patch" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
