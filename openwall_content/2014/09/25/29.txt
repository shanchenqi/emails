Please look at the code in    http://git.infradead.org/users/jcooper/secsh.git/blob/HEAD:/match.c  line 70.  match_cmd() compares the contents of $SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND to the configured list of acceptable commands.  It returns the array index only if there is an exact match.  Then, in secsh.c, we execute the command from the array of allowed commands.  The buffer holding $SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND is never trusted, nor executed.  There is no shell, bash or otherwise, called ever.  While tinkering with this, I discovered that if you force ssh to provide a pty (ssh -t ...), even with secsh locked down, the hack works.  You *must* set 'no-pty' after 'command=' in your authorized_keys file to prevent ssh from launching a shell. :-/  thx,  Jason.
