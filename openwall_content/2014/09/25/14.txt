A user on Twitter posted[2] that the patch was incomplete. There is agreement on that much. Where I see different responses is on whether the first patch can still be exploited remotely via the CGI vector outlined in Florian's initial post, and what damage can still be done. I haven't seen a proof of concept yet, but I also haven't seen a trusted voice give a definitive statement that it can't be abused.  Could anyone lay out what's still possible for a remote attacker via CGI with only the first patch applied?
