The LibVNCServer project, an open source library for implementing VNC compliant communication, suffers from a number of bugs that can be potentially exploited with security impact.  Various implementation issues resulting in remote code execution and/or DoS conditions on both the VNC server and client side have been discovered.   1. A malicious VNC server can trigger incorrect memory management     handling by advertising a large screen size parameter to the VNC     client. This would result in multiple memory corruptions and could     allow remote code execution on the VNC client.   2. A malicious VNC client can trigger multiple DoS conditions on the VNC     server by advertising a large screen size, ClientCutText message     length and/or a zero scaling factor parameter.   3. A malicious VNC client can trigger multiple stack-based buffer     overflows by passing a long file and directory names and/or attributes     (FileTime) when using the file transfer message feature.  It should be noted that every described issue represents a post-authentication bug, therefore the server side conditions can be anonymously leveraged only if the VNC server is configured to allow unauthenticated sessions.
