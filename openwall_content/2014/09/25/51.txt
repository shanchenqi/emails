When the 'insecure' option is set in a paste configuration file it is effectively ignored, regardless of its value. As a result certificate verification will be disabled, leaving TLS connections open to MITM attacks. All versions of keystonemiddleware with TLS settings configured via a paste.ini file are affected by this flaw.  keystonemiddleware fix:  python-keystoneclient fix:  Notes: These fixes are included in the keystonemiddleware release and in the python-keystoneclient release.
