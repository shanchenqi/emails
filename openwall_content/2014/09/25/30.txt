I tested this with "env -".  > There is no shell, bash or otherwise, called ever.  Huh?

This isn't the case here.  What version/package of OpenSSH are you using?  I do have a habit to specify no-pty whenever I use "command=", but I also have a habit to start the actual command with "exec ..." specifically because the shell is invoked anyway (the "exec" then saves some memory on not keeping that shell around while the actual program runs).  I've tried specifying /full/path/to/program, like you do, but this does not prevent invocation going via the shell here.  My OpenSSH is rather old, though (with lots of patches).
