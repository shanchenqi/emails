I agree that keeping the error messages is the right thing if we can keep them contained to local usage (and local attack) scenarios under typical setups.  I think applying Florian's prefix-suffix patch will achieve that (besides its main goal of actually mitigating most attacks).  What do you think of distros' going with Florian's prefix-suffix patch right now?  I think it breaks function imports/exports between pre-patch and post-patch bash versions, but keeps them intact for patched versions.  Right?  If so, this sounds acceptable for immediate use by distros.  Do you agree?
