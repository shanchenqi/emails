I think that at this point the only salvation is to disable function import by default and provide a command line flag and a "set" flag to explicitly enable it (so that scripts that depend on it can easily be fixed). It is not a widely used feature, and both subshells and sourced scripts don't need it or use it. It might have seemed like a good idea a couple of decades ago, but it needs to go.  christos  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
