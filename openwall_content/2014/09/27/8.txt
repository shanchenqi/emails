Upstream fix, determined by bisection:    As far as I know this was not identified as a security problem upstream, just fixed as a normal bug in the course of development.  The sources.debian.net use case turns it into a DoS though.  CCing the upstream author for his information.  Not affected: 5.6 Affected: 5.8 (the latest release)  Since we'd like to issue patches for this bug as security updates, please could I have a CVE identifier for this?  Thanks,  --  Colin Watson                                       [cjwatson@...ian.org]  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
