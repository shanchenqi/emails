Yes.  I have no problems worth mentioning with the exported function encoding approach.  I have attached patches implementing it that can be applied to bash versions from to bash-4.3.  Please take a look, make sure they can be applied cleanly, and so on.  There is another discussion worth having before officially releasing these, which I will do later today.  The original set of patches and its siblings) tightened the restrictions on allowable imported function names, forcing them to be shell identifiers.  The shell itself, when not in posix mode, allows virtually any character that is not a shell metacharacter to appear in a function name (that's basically the difference between an identifier and a word in shell-grammar-speak).  This results in the ability to define functions like this:  $ function /bin/echo () { builtin echo whoops; }  and have this happen:  $ /bin/echo whoops  along with exporting these functions and importing them without complaint.  This is obviously bad, and I removed the ability to do this in the first patch in the event that someone figured out an easy way to remotely specify an arbitrary variable name before we implemnted something to stop it.  The problem is that it's too restrictive.  There are folks who have taken advantage of this flexibility to define, use, and export functions like  STD::what::does::this::do  which are no longer allowed.  This is a pretty bad break with backwards compatibility.  So what's your opinion on the appropriate set of restrictions? This is a question that goes farther than what a particular shell will import, since I'm going to align the restrictions on what functions a shell will import from the environment with what functions that shell will let a user define.  That means that a posix-mode shell will require imported functions to be valid identifiers, but a non-posix mode shell will allow words.  The original check that was in bash-4.3 does this.  What additional checks should there be? I can see starting with rejecting function names that can be confused with pathnames.  Please chime in and let me know what you think.
