Description: When specifying the trustRoot (CA store) for the HTTP client, Twisted did not respect the user's specification, and always used the default of the platform trust. This means that users attempting to use this feature to implement certificate pinning, or otherwise restrict the trust CAs would still have accepted any certificate signed by a CA.  Twisted has been issued to resolve this issue; (Distributors should note that this release has failing tests, and that a release will be issued tomorrow, this does not effect the fix, only the tests).
