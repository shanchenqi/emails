In order to ensure full traceability, we need a CVE number assigned that we can attach to further notifications. This issue is already public, although an advisory was not sent yet.  Title: TLS cert verification option not honoured in paste configs Reporter: Qin Zhao (IBM) Products: keystonemiddleware, python-keystoneclient Versions: versions up to (keystonemiddleware), versions up to (python-keystoneclient)  Description: Qin Zhao from IBM reported a vulnerability in keystonemiddleware (formerly shipped as python-keystoneclient). When the 'insecure' SSL option is set in  a paste configuration file it is effectively ignored, regardless of its  value.  As a result certificate verification will be disabled, leaving TLS connections open to MITM attacks. All versions of keystonemiddleware with TLS settings configured via a paste.ini file are affected by this flaw.
