Some people are still unaware that this change has happened or have been slow to implement it.  Once a CVE identifier is issued using the new syntax, some security products and processes could break or report incorrect vulnerability identifiers, making vulnerability management more difficult.  Consider a product that stops processing an XML document because its validation step assumes that CVE IDs have only 4 digits.  Perhaps worse, consider a critical vulnerability in a popular product that is given a 5-digit CVE ID, which is inadvertently and silently truncated to a 4-digit ID for a low-priority issue in a rarely-used product.  We know of at least 5 different products or services that have had problems. Custom, in-house software is not necessarily immune, either.  MITRE has been assigning CVE IDs faster than ever; we're up to even though it's only September, which puts us on pace to exceed for by the end of the year - and the rate of assignment could increase in the coming months.  Even if we don't reach identifiers by the end of MITRE will be issuing at least one 5-digit identifier no later than January 13, to ensure that all software is tested for support of the new syntax.  To help people address this problem, we have created a web page about the ID syntax change, including the product features most likely to be affected, along with some test data.    http://cve.mitre.org/cve/identifiers/syntaxchange.html  For a list of the 19 early adopters who have stated that they are compliant with the new syntax, see:    http://cve.mitre.org/cve/identifiers/compliant_organizations.html  The clock is ticking!
