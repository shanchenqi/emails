While taking a closer look at this issue on Bash 4.2, I noticed a potential NULL deref. i.e.    $ FOO='() { :;}; bash -c "echo bleh"  This occurs in bgp_prune() where, because bgpids.npid=0 and js_c_childmax=-1, the code in the loop executes but bgpids.list=NULL.  I didn't look closely enough to know if this situation is only reachable via the recently-fixed vulnerable code-path or not.  --mancha  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
