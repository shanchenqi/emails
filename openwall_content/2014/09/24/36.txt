This brings up the question: why did someone (merely?) running a news site receive the exact advance notification message (or a portion of it), and when did they receive it?  I doubt a person merely running a news site actually received advance notification in this case (I hope not!), but I think you need to clarify this aspect.  > So to repeat: The embargo was scheduled for UTC today, and my > initial brief posting was not prompted by a desire to withhold > information.

Yes, I think including the full message in your first notification to oss-security would have worked best.  > We'll also want to discuss additional hardening measures (see my > message about BASH_FUNCDEFS), and we previously agreed to do this > publicly, after disclosure.
