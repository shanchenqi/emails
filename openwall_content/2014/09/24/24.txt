I worry about potential side effects of parsing even in absence of parser bugs. In most object-oriented languages, such side effects are practically guaranteed. Bash may be saved by simplicity, but not sure how robust that assumption is.  I've written more code in bash than I should have and never used function exports, or even realized that they exist. I wonder if they can be made optional (e.g., gated by a flag on the subprocess) without breakage.  Another option may be to export them through specially prefixed variables, which should be transparent but minimize the risk of interfering with web servers and such.  /mz  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
