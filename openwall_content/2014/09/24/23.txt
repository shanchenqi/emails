At least that's what apache wiki documents: > https://wiki.apache.org/httpd/php-fcgid  I don't know what's common with PHP.  I don't think there is much public  documentation about what it takes to run PHP at scale in a secure  fashion (also taking compromised or downright malicious customers into  account).  > So that'd mean many php installations are affected even if they don't > use subprocesses. > > I'm not sure if this wrapper can be avoided.  The wrapper does not run per request.  I have not tested this, but I  don't think it sees any request-specific environment variables at this  point.  FCGI transfers request information over a socket at descriptor 0  and not through environment variables.  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
