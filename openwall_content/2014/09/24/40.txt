It strongly suggests that the parser is fragile and that there may be unexpected side effects, though; parsing functions seen in HTTP_* and such seems like a very risky proposition.  /mz  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
