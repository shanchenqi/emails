I also see gnutls posted a new release some days, with this entry without CVE  "** libgnutls: Fixed issue with certificates being sanitized by gnutls prior to signature verification. That resulted to certain non-DER compliant modifications of valid certificates, being corrected by libtasn1's parser and restructured as the original. Issue found and reported by Antti Karjalainen and Matti Kamunen from Codenomicon."  which smells similar.
