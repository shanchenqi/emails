Upstream: http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html  In bin/generate_doxygen.pl line it says: > my $output = "/tmp/".$i.".".$$.".doxygen";  This path is later opened for writing. For context, see:  Initial disclosure:  (end of CVE request)  A quick "grep -r /tmp $ace_source" indicates more occasions that may be worth researching. Most of the results reside within examples or documentation though.  An interesting find is bin/g++-dep line 63: > TMP=/tmp/g++dep$$ This path is also used for writing. The context can be found at: I am not sure whether instance is actually executed during the build, but the Debian package installs it to the development package available for user consumption.
