This message seemed to conclude with an implied request for more information, e.g., "it looks like you can," etc. An example of a security impact would be: the administrator wanted pinger to be running, and a crash means that pinger processes/threads are no longer available, and pinger is not automatically restarted.  If there is a security impact, then the patch in Novell Bug would probably correspond to at least three CVE IDs, e.g.,  1. "used to index into a string array" possibly corresponds to for the modified default case after case and approximately two other places in the patch  2. added "if (n <= 0)" code possibly corresponds to  3. added "if (preply.psize) < 0" code apparently corresponds to a more general issue with missing data validation  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =mktA -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
