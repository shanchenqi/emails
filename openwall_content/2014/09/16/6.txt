With #3 the size is not limited to c-string bytes terminated on first nil. There it amounts to the difference between the expected payload and received payload. A negative value in that calculation could result in a large number of bytes flooding the parent processes log, slowing the entire service down and/or exhausting log disk space, which in turn can crash the parent process.   The best-case being that some HTTP servers are assigned incorrect RTT values. Which adversely affects latency based routing logics for all traffic involving that server IP.
