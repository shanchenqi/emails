This message seemed to conclude  Well, in any case whether its restarted or not, it should be fixed. For me its a remote DoS, its your decision if it qualifies for a CVE. The indexing bug is the "real issue" whereas the others IMHO qualify as hardening and only produce junk-packets or fake logs if exploited.
