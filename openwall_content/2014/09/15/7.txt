This apparently has multiple known vulnerability types.  Use for the buffer overflow.  Use for the issue of incorrect handling of kmalloc failures.  Use for ths missing validation of the auth reply.  Our guess is that is intended to address all three of these crash issues, but additional CVE IDs might be needed if there were an incomplete fix.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =XnWo -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
