When the destination directory does not exist, install-sh checks if  "mkdir -p" works, but it does so in an insecure way. Here are the  relevant parts of the code:  mkdirprog=${MKDIRPROG-mkdir} # ...         tmpdir=${TMPDIR-/tmp}/ins$RANDOM-$$         trap 'ret=$?; rmdir "$tmpdir/d" "$tmpdir" 2>/dev/null; exit $ret' 0          if (umask $mkdir_umask &&         exec $mkdirprog $mkdir_mode -p -- "$tmpdir/d") >/dev/null 2>&1         then # ...           rmdir "$tmpdir/d" "$tmpdir"         else # ...  In some shells (such as dash) $RANDOM is not set, so $tmpdir is easily  predictable. Moreover, "mkdir -p" follows symlinks to existing  directories. Local attacker can exploit this to create or remove empty  directories named "d". (But on modern Linux systems this is mitigated by the protected_symlinks feature.)
