I was wrong.  The issue was first brought to the distros list via a separate message on September 8, two days before public disclosure. So use of the distros list was appropriate.  The only thing that went wrong (as far as list policy is concerned) was that on September 10 a notification wasn't sent to oss-security (but was sent to distros).
