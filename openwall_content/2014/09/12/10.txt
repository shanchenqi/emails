Please refer to the URL above for much more detail, and a patch. Looking at the patch, I see that one of the conditions it handles is "labellen > 63", and it throws an exception when this happens.  It is not clear to me whether or not arbitrary code execution is possible via this vulnerability (via any of several issues that are now patched). The pieces seen within the (very limited) context of the patch look like the risk is there, and it'd take thorough analysis or a PoC to arrive at either conclusion with confidence.  This issue was brought to the distros list at about the same time that it was made public.  Per distros list policy, the issue must also be brought to oss-security:  http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros#how-to-use-the-lists  "When the security issue is finally to be made public, it is your (the original reporter's) responsibility to post about it to oss-security"  Since the issue was already public on the same day, I think it should have been posted to oss-security right away, without use of the distros list.  (Any distro on the distros list is supposed to also be on oss-security.)  The wiki page states this, too:  "Please only use these lists to report and discuss security issues that are not yet public (but that are to be made public very soon - please see below).  For security issues that are already public or that are to be made public right away, please post to oss-security instead."  Even though formally it was not my responsibility to bring the issue to oss-security, I apologize to the oss-security community for the two day delay in doing so.
