If anyone is later requesting a CVE ID for that, we can mention:    ACE_wrappers/debian/debian.changelog    ace unstable; urgency=low        * Add the following missing programs to libace-dev:       o $ACE_ROOT/bin/generate_export_file.pl       o $ACE_ROOT/bin/split-cpp       o $ACE_ROOT/bin/g++dep       o $ACE_ROOT/bin/add_rel_link.sh  This apparently means that at least one version of libace-dev was shipped with the generate_doxygen.pl file but without the g++dep file, and thus we'd have a situation of "different affected versions."  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =1vFr -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
