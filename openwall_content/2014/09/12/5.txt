Such information was on included in past CPUs - they only mention the last affected version in supported branch.  So in case of this flaw, it's most likely only going to say:    Supported Versions Affected: and earlier, and earlier  That will not answer the original question, or provide more information than what's already available.  I mean it's reasonable to admit the info about the first affected version is not readily available and won't be looked for, just noting that CPU is very unlikely to provide that information.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
