The short answer is that we neither agree nor disagree at present; we think that either any required CVE assignment can be made by us after a full public disclosure, or any required CVE assignment can be made by a different CNA now.  Further details: MITRE has been contacted about this rsync and librsync report through multiple channels. The reply that we sent wasn't previously copied here because it didn't seem to be about a publicly known vulnerability.  MITRE has no role in determining the list charter, but http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security says "List Content Guidelines ... Public security issues only please."  says "my last response from Wayne was effectively denying that this is a vulnerability" and "I won't provide full details yet, but if any distributions would like some collisions to perform specific tests (perhaps on Openstack Swift), please get in contact privately."  adds "I have provided a privileged few with PoC" and "My plan was to wait for fixes before releasing the full write-up and code."  Our feeling is that, if the issue is not really public, sending a CVE request to the oss-security list is not a standard procedure. It seems that the simplest way forward would occur if one of the above-mentioned "privileged few" is a CNA on the http://cve.mitre.org/cve/cna.html list. They can evaluate the information that they have and make one or more CVE assignments. If the meaning of the CVE assignments is understandable without referring to the non-public details, then it might be useful to send the CVE assignments here, even before the full public disclosure.  MITRE is not currently interested in receiving an advance copy of the full public disclosure or any related PoC information from anyone. We'll see whether the CNA process above can work.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =FTO9 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
