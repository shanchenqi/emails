I've seen quite a few examples like this which don't do precisely what the submitter thought.  I hope this isn't another such example:  $ env $'BASH_FUNC_\nfoo%%=() { echo }' ./bash -c 'foo' ./bash: error importing function definition for ` foo'  This doesn't seem like desired behavior.  In the version before the recent patches, adding unexpected characters could cause segfaults.  -- Eric Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
