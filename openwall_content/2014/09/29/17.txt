This means that anyone with access to the keyboard of a locked GNOME session can (briefly) disable the lockscreen, which lets them see and interact with the running gnome session:     It looks like fixes are targeted for GNOME  Regards,  	--dkg   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
