Due to the nature of the vulnerability, I believe that it's best to break backward compatibility as done by FreeBSD and NetBSD until a proper patch is developed. We are lucky to have security researchers reporting their findings publicly. What about others that don't ?  I strongly believe that it's much safer to have it disabled, and have a complete and comprehensive audit of the source code, and then re-enable it.    > -- > Regards, > Bryan Drewery    --  This message is strictly personal and the opinions expressed do not represent those of my employers, either past or present.
