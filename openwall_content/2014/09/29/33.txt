The function export code mallocs, but never frees it. That behavior predates the recent patches.  That's because parse_and_execute takes ownership of the string by  default.  See the comment in builtins/evalstring.c:  /* Parse and execute the commands in STRING.  Returns whatever     execute_command () returns.  This frees STRING.  FLAGS is a     flags word; look in common.h for the possible values.  Actions     are:          (flags & SEVAL_NONINT) -> interactive = 0;          (flags & SEVAL_INTERACT) -> interactive = 1;          (flags & SEVAL_NOHIST) -> call bash_history_disable ()          (flags & SEVAL_NOFREE) -> don't free STRING when finished          (flags & SEVAL_RESETLINE) -> reset line_number to 1 */   --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
