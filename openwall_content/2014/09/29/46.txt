For POSIXLY_CORRECT: yes.  Very early on in main() the shell looks for POSIXLY_CORRECT and POSIX_PEDANTIC in the environment and sets posixly_correct to 1 if either one is found.  For bash -o posix: yes.  Options (including long options like --posix) are parsed well before the environment is read.  For /bin/sh: no.  As documented, the shell enters posix mode after it reads the startup files.
