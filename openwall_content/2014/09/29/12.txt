By updating a network attribute with a default value a non-privileged user may reset admin-only network attributes. This may lead to unexpected behavior with security implications for operators with a custom policy.json, or in some extreme cases network outages resulting in denial of service. All deployments using neutron networking are affected by this flaw.  Juno (development branch) fix:  Icehouse fix:  Notes: This fix will be included in the Juno release and in future release.
