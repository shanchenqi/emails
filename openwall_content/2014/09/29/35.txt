No bash needed.  At the very least, at should use the "export foo=bar" form which will allow it to fail closed in the presence of environment variables that are not valid shell identifiers.  I've just committed such a change to OpenBSD's at(1) which shares a common lineage.  However, the atrun file format should really be changed to be more robust and not simply be fed to /bin/sh.   - todd  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
