In that case, the applicable CVE ID is not a separate CVE ID specific to QNAP's build.  If you mean something else -- for example, if another reference states that the implementation language of restore_config.cgi is not sh and that the design of restore_config.cgi was supposed to drop privileges immediately, but there's an implementation flaw in which Bash is launched before privileges are dropped -- then there could conceivably be a separate CVE ID for that restore_config.cgi issue. Similarly, if you're referring to an authentication bypass -- for example, if the implementation language of restore_config.cgi is not sh and the design of restore_config.cgi was supposed to exit immediately for unauthenticated requests, but there's an implementation flaw in which Bash is launched before missing authentication is detected, then there could conceivably be a separate CVE ID.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =kin/ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
