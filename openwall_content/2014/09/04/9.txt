Dear all,  I'm looking for comments about a XCache bug which is visible in Ubuntu (and left unfixed so far). It is It basically happens when you try to query XCache state, then it SIGSEV (and thus makes php5 crash). This can be easily reproduced with the Munin plugin at: http://www.ohardt.net/dev/munin/ (munin_xcache.php file). It triggers the crash on every query on our infrastructure.  I'm not sure it's a security issue as you may protect this using admin password. But what about shared web hosting where you wouldn't have set any password?  Was it spotted/reported on other distributions?  Cheers,  --  Pierre Schweitzer <pierre@...ctos.org> System & Network Administrator Senior Kernel Developer ReactOS Deutschland e.V.
