Also, the specific wording "A memory corruption vulnerability, which results in a denial-of-service, was identified in the versions of V8" was discussed with upstream. The information that we have is that the issue actually should not be considered a vulnerability in V8, and instead should be considered a vulnerability in Node.js. It is not a case where a CVE assignment by Google would have been expected.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJUCHvMAAoJEKllVAevmvmsKWwIAMicXsaWhOBpfBNzyU/g8GBl =kw2P -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
