As the error message you got suggests - it's likely an id in some internal bug tracking system.  Don't expect it to be useful for anything else than matching release notes entry to bzr commit.  Also note that security fixes are not mentioned in release notes for some time - inclusion of this one is likely an omission rather than intention.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
