As pointed out in this Gentoo bug, release notes for the mentioned MySQL versions list another issue that seems to be security:   3) An off-by-one error related to certificate decoding in yaSSL can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow.  BZR commit:    There are many other issues that deserve clarification.  For example, April CPU mentions client issue  Is it the same issue that got publicly assigned before?  The versions that fixed are the same that got fix, and there's no mention of the in April CPU.   Actually, any CVE assigned to an open source project should have sufficient details made available to make it possible to link it to specific change or changes unambiguously.  Despite previous requests, Oracle seems to refuse that even when CVEs are public.  At the same time expecting advance notification with details.  Maybe this should be taken into account for e.g. distros membership?  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
