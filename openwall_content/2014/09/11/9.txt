The problem is that there are a lot of naĂŻve developers who have little idea about security issues.  The more we (any of us can do) to highlight the problems anywhere means that there are better chances of those same developers becoming aware of the issues.  The fatality bit is perhaps a little over the top, but not much.   I recall a couple of problems from comparatively recent times that caused physical destruction of hardware: one was a (CRT) monitor, the other a printer.  I think the printer was potentially connected to the Internet.  In older times, we had disk packs coming out of a drive like a huge multi-layered frisbee (someone had the bright idea of double the spin but the bearings for the disk weren't up to it) or the chain in a chain printer breaking and finding a letter "p" embedded in the wall months later.  Imagine an internet-connected TV that has the potential to overheat and catch fire due to some bug.   Some script-kiddie thinks that it would be fun to use one of the other vulns to break in and cause the TV to catch fire.  At night.  When the owners are asleep ...
