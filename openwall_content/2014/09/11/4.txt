We're not sure whether a CVE request was intended for this. Here, the wording "via template source file" would typically mean an attack vector, but maybe what is meant is that a template source file is the vulnerable file. If the scenario were something like "the extension enables an attack by accepting template source files from untrusted parties in a way that is unintended by Smarty," then the extension could be considered the primary affected product and could have its own CVE ID for this issue. If this Problem Description text is intended to mean that Smarty is the primary affected product, then a CVE for the previously known issue in Smarty might already exist. If anyone knows the best reference for "Old versions of this library are known to be vulnerable," that could help resolve the question.  wec_map SQL Injection               wec_map Cross-Site Scripting          mm_forum Cross-Site Scripting upload arbitrary files ...

We could combine them into one CVE if CSRF were the single root cause of all of the issues, but nobody has reported that here, and it seems relatively unlikely.   > Can I get CVE for > direct_mail exposes user data including the original authentication code   - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =1pSZ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
