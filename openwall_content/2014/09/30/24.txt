Now for a slightly less simplified version:  putenv("PATH=/bin:/usr/bin"); setreuid(0, 0); system("date");  But the point is I've tried to boil down a relatively complex program by studying endless strace outputs to attempt to demonstrate a real world exploit.  It wasn't actually "date" that was being called, but you get the point.  In the past, i.e. pre-Shellshock, the above code may have raised eyebrows, but as PATH was sanitised it would have passed numerous security audits.  If /bin/sh were anything but bash, this would not be exploitable.  However, and even with the latest Shellshock patches available to us today, this remains exploitable on Red Hat, or on any system where the system shell is bash.  That is why this must remain a bash issue, and bash should be fixed to prevent it, and why I've asked for a new CVE to track this.
