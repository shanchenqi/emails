I think Rainer is not subscribed to oss-security.  I've just added him to CC on this reply.  Rainer - please address Sven's questions above.  All - please note that the bug is likely present in many other syslog services.  It likely dates back all the way to Eric Allman's syslog, although I have not checked to make sure yet.  pri-vuln.txt in the tarball attached to Rainer's message specifically mentions sysklogd as "mildly affected":  | Affected | -------- | - rsyslog, most probably all versions (checked | - sysklogd (checked most recent versions) | - potentially others (see root cause)  [...]  | sysklogd | ~~~~~~~~ | Sysklogd is mildly affected. Having a quick look at the current git master | branch, the wrong action may be applied to messages with invalid facility. |  | A segfault seems unlikely, as the maximum misadressing is bytes of the | f_pmask table, which is always within properly allocated memory (albeit to | wrong data items). This can lead to triggering invalid selector lines and | thus wrongly writing to files or wrongly forwarding to other hosts.
