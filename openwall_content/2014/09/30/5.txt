The older code in which processutils.execute was simply logging cmd directly, without any masking step, can be considered an instance of the issue. For this, use  The older code with a short _FORMAT_PATTERNS list, with a later replacement by longer _FORMAT_PATTERNS_1 and _FORMAT_PATTERNS_2 lists, can be considered an instance of the issue. Bug mentions 'mask_password did not, for example, catch the usage ... /usr/sbin/mysqld --password=top-secret ... They did catch ... /usr/sbin/mysqld --password="top-secret" ... make the strings in strutils.mask_password more robust.' For this, use  The additional complication is that there were apparently already releases with incomplete fixes for Separate CVE IDs are needed when parts of the problem were fixed in different releases. For example, Cinder contains a fix for the "Running cmd (subprocess)" logging problem but apparently does not contain a fix for the "Running cmd (SSH)" logging problem. The patch for the latter is shown in the commit. Is this a remaining vulnerability in Cinder and possibly other products? If so, then we will assign another CVE ID.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =YprV -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
