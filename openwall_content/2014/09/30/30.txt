It should say which is the v7 version released today. v7.4.x is not only non-project supported, it's also heavily outdated and missing many other patches as well (just to point this out).   > I think Rainer is not subscribed to oss-security.

If an app processes syslog messages based on facility/severity values, it probably is a good idea to check how it does that.  Thanks for the follow-up and cc'ing!
