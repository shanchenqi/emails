C.O. to the rescue: temporary file.  If one shell instance needs to pass some functions to another, it could dump those functions to a temporary file and pass the --load (or, better, --load-functions) options with a filename parameter.  The functions file name may also be passed through environment, but that could open another set of security holes (like reading files).   --  Alexey V.
