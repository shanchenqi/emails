See the comment in builtins/evalstring.c:   I did miss that comment. Assuming that parse_and_execute operates as expected, the memory doesn't leak so long as parse_and_execute is invoked.  How do you feel about changing from this:     if (absolute_program (tname) == 0 && (posixly_correct == 0 || legal_identifier (tname)))      parse_and_execute (temp_string, tname, SEVAL_NONINT|SEVAL_NOHIST|SEVAL_FUNCDEF|SEVAL_ONECMD);  to this? (please forgive style gaffes)     if (absolute_program (tname) == 0 && (posixly_correct == 0 || legal_identifier (tname)))    {      parse_and_execute (temp_string, tname, SEVAL_NONINT|SEVAL_NOHIST|SEVAL_FUNCDEF|SEVAL_ONECMD);    }    else    {      FREE(temp_string);    }  -- Eric Kobrin Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
