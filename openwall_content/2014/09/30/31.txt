Once the shell needs to run something, it can create a new file with exported stuff.

If the attacker needs to create the file AND to fill the environment variable to succeed, that more likely is more secure.

Hmmm... Well, requiring both a file and an environment variable may be a good solution. Or not.   --  Alexey V.
