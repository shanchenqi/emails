If we would have rejected the patch we would not have run into this mess.  I agreed to add the patch because it won't harm and had to find out that it costed me about 3 days to get the regressions fixed :-(.  And now theses funny complaints that it is unsafe to import arbitrary keys.  I recall mail clients which always imported attached keys - not a bad thing.  S/MIME works the same.  One could debate whether such automatically imported keys may eventuallt expire from the keyring but this is orthogonal to the issues at hand.  *gpgv* is the tool to verify signatures using a well defined set of keys.  It has been written exactly for that purpose.  *gpg* requires that you use one of the available trust models - presence of a key in the keyring is not such a model.
