It is however argued that as a user, requesting keys based on  specifying the full fingerprint is a safe way to retreive a key for a known- good fingerprint. But this argument is again somewhat countered by an attack  on V3 keys which allows generating such fingerprints, making such a request  dubious again.  All in all, the safe choice seems to be to patch this issue, so Debian will  release updates for it. It has been fixed upstream in GnuPG with this  commit: http://git.gnupg.org/cgi-  I'll leave it to the numbering authorities whether this is something that  should get a CVE id.
