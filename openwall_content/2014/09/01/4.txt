Hi.  Isn't it the opposite? Were key servers fully trusted I'd agree "expected behavior" would be to blindly import the server's reply.  However, the lack of trustworthiness of keyservers is precisely why the check is relevant.  Note: it is not being suggested this check be considered a replacement for full key verification. But, it is not unreasonable for a user to expect when instructing gpg to import a key with FP that the gpg binary is indeed importing a key with FP  --mancha  PS Thijs' email signature verified for me using mutt.
