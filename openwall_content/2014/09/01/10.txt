The issue is triggered when the buffer fails to contain a ' ' or '?' symbol, which will cause the end pointer to increase and surpass allocated memory. With a specially crafted request (e.g. via the OPTIONS method), a remote attacker can cause a loss of availability for the program." as described in [1]. From what I can see this was fixed in [2].  Has a CVE been assigned to this issue already? if not I request that one is assigned.
