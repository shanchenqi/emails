A longer-term would be to just replace MD5 with a collision-resistant hash function - blake2 is a good fit.  The output is right on the edge of being strong enough.  I submitted a very rough patch which does both, but I haven't had the time to clean the rough edges - the libdetectcoll codebase needs a fair amount of cleaning (printfs etc), and the rsync codebase needs a fair bit of refactor to handle hash output lengths > 16 bytes.
