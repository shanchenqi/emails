Should we perhaps err on the side of approving > postings whenever in doubt?  Investigating license status to decide whether some post should be approved sounds like a very bad use of your time.  List charter already says Open Source software issues only are expected to be posted here. If post is related to something that is obviously closed source, it should be rejected.  If it's something which has source available, allow it in without investigating if it has OSI approved license, or is properly licensed at all.  The above can be re-visited if there is actually a relevant number of abuses.
