But the "or something close" is kind of the current state of affairs which puts the onus on the moderators, which isn't ideal.  I'd be inclined to suggest that the moderators use their own judgement without worrying too much about list look-ups and feel free to err on the side of letting through too much rather than too little and members are free to ask a topic be taken off-list, citing either the above (or SPDX or the FSF list, if they like, though honestly I think the FSF goes a bit far in their definition of non-free, I think PERL is perfectly fair game for this list) as the reason why it isn't relevant.  Or, of course, as below.  Because you're perfectly correct, lots of closed-source vendors either don't care or don't want their errors discussed openly.  Either has no place here, Full Disclosure is a perfectly fine venue for that.
