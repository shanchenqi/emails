Can one be assigned if it has not already been?  Described on the nodejs blog as:  A memory corruption vulnerability, which results in a denial-of-service, was identified in the versions of V8 that ship with Node.js 0.8 and In certain circumstances, a particularly deep recursive workload that may trigger a GC and receive an interrupt may overflow the stack and result in a segmentation fault. For instance, if your work load involves successive JSON.parse calls and the parsed objects are significantly deep, you may experience the process aborting while parsing.  This issue was identified by Tom Steele of ^Lift Security and Fedor Indunty, Node.js Core Team member worked closely with the V8 team to find our resolution.     --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Product Security  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
