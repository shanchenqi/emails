Correct, because those patches aren't official yet.  But at the same time, the out-of-bounds bugs can no longer be used as a remote exploit vehicle, because the official patch (and friends) guarantee that arbitrary values no longer call into the parser.  >  > While not exposing the parser to random variables should shield that > somewhat and reduce impact, they still should be fixed and the redhat > patch looks pretty straightforward.  I'm sure Chet has plans to post more official patches in the coming week.  --  Eric Blake   eblake redhat com    Libvirt virtualization library http://libvirt.org   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
