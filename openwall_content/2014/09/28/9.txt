The problem with this approach is that a sh is useful for both system(3) and wrapping things like java.  This problem came up because bash was parsing environment variables even when the script wasn't referencing them.  I don't think anyone lets network users set completely arbitrary environment variable names.  I think Debian's approach of dash as /bin/sh, and bash as an interactive shell is the right balance.  I switched a Fedora box to using dash as /bin/sh, and so far have only logged one bug for something that broke, and it pretty much deserved to break (BZ  Regards,   Michael  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
