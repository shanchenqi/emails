I'm also worried about this:     	  /* Don't import function names that are invalid identifiers from the   	     environment. */ ! 	  if (absolute_program (tname) == 0 && (posixly_correct == 0 || legal_identifier (tname))) ! 	    parse_and_execute (temp_string, tname, SEVAL_NONINT|SEVAL_NOHIST|SEVAL_FUNCDEF|SEVAL_ONECMD);  One of the complaints upstream is that:  >> Yes, it does do this detection, but too late for our concern, since things  >> occur in the following order: >>  >>  (1) set_shell_name(argv[0]) => this detects "sh" and sets 'act_like_sh' >>  (2) shell_initialize() => this decides to import funcs from env depending on  >> flags like 'posixly_correct' >>  (3) if (act_like_sh) ... sv_strict_posix ("POSIXLY_CORRECT")  Are you sure that posixly_correct is correctly initialized at this point in parsing the incoming environment variables, regardless of whether you invoked '/bin/sh', 'bash -o posix', or 'POSIXLY_CORRECT=1 bash'?  I'm especially worried about the latter - if 'FUNC_BASH_a:%%=() {...}' occurs in the environment earlier than 'POSIXLY_CORRECT=1', then you may end up allowing function 'a:' in the namespace because you didn't realize you should have been in posix mode.  Note - I have not audited the code to see if you do a getenv("POSIXLY_CORRECT") (or equivalent) prior to the processing loop of parsing incoming environment variables in general, but since you are more familiar with the code base, I'm hoping you can give a reassuring answer.  --  Eric Blake   eblake redhat com    Libvirt virtualization library http://libvirt.org   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
