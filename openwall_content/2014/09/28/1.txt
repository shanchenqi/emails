OK, here are the more-or-less final versions of the patches for through bash-4.3.  I made two changes from earlier today: the function export suffix is now `%%', which is not part of a the set of valid variable name characters but avoids any potential problems with including shell metacharacters in the name; and this version refuses to import shell functions whose name contains a slash, for reasons I discussed earlier.  Please let me know if you have any issues with these.
