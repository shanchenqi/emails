I'm still a bit worried about the fact that people can do 'function a=b () { echo oops; }'; on the outgoing direction, this puts:  BASH_FUNC_a=b%%=() { echo oops; }  into the environment, and on the incoming direction that means that you have populated $BASH_FUNC_a as a _regular_ variable with contents "b%% { echo oops; }'.  The parser is not run (so we are immune to Shell Shock), but you are polluting the child namespace with a regular variable that the parent did NOT export.  With your patch as-is:  $ bash -c 'function a=b(){ echo oops;};export -f a=b;export BASH_FUNC_a=hi; bash -c "echo \$BASH_FUNC_a"' b%%=() { echo oops }  Your attempt to export an invalid function name ended up clobbering a regular variable.  So I highly recommend that you further tighten things up to reject '=' in function names.  Here's your existing tightening line:     	  /* Don't import function names that are invalid identifiers from the   	     environment. */ ! 	  if (absolute_program (tname) == 0 && (posixly_correct == 0 || legal_identifier (tname))) ! 	    parse_and_execute (temp_string, tname,  where absolute_program() filters anything with '/', and the use of posixly_correct decides whether to further restrict to variable names.   --  Eric Blake   eblake redhat com    Libvirt virtualization library http://libvirt.org   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
