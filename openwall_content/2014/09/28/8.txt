This release fixes a number of local privilege escalation vulnerability and one remote code execution vulnerability, as follows:  fish universal variable socket vulnerable to permission  bypass leading to privilege escalation    fish, from at least version to version (inclusive), does not   check the credentials of processes communicating over the fishd universal   variable server UNIX domain socket. This allows a local attacker to    elevate their privileges to those of a target user running fish, including    root.    fish version is not vulnerable.    No workaround is currently available for earlier versions of fish.     and fish temporary file creation vulnerable to  race condition leading to privilege escalation    fish, from at least version to version (inclusive), creates   temporary files in an insecure manner.    Versions to (inclusive) execute code via `funced` from these   temporary files, allowing privilege escalation to those of any user    running fish, including root.    Additionally, from at least version to version (inclusive),   fish will read data using the psub function from these temporary files,   meaning that the input of commands used with the psub function is under    the control of the attacker.    fish version is not vulnerable.    No workaround is currently available for earlier versions of fish.     fish web interface does not restrict access leading to remote code execution    fish, from version to version (inclusive), fails to restrict   connections to the Web-based configuration service (fish_config). This   allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the    user running fish_config.    The service is generally only running for short periods of time.    fish version is not vulnerable.    No workaround is currently available for earlier versions of fish,    although the use of the fish_config tool is optional as other interfaces    to fish configuration are available.     fish temporary file access leading to privilege escalation    fish, from at least version to version (inclusive), uses   temporary files in an insecure manner.    fish will read and write completions from these temporary files without   checking for ownership or symbolic links, allowing data corruption.    fish version is not vulnerable.    No workaround is currently available for earlier versions of fish.
