One CVE might be enough as per same reporters and fixed in version.   It has been discovered that the extension "mm_forum" (mm_forum) is vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution, Cross-Site Scripting and Cross-Site Request Forgery.  Release Date: February 12, Affected Versions: Version and below Vulnerability Type: Arbitrary Code Execution, Cross-Site Scripting and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).  Severity: Critical Suggested CVSS v2.0: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C  Problem Description: Failing to properly sanitize user-supplied input the extension is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting. It was possible to upload arbitrary files as files were not checked against the file deny pattern, thus Arbitrary Code Execution was possible by uploading PHP files. Additionally it was possible to create posts on behalf of logged in users (CSRF).  Solution: An updated version is available from the TYPO3 extension manager and at Users of the extension are advised to update the extension as soon as possible.  Credits: Credits go to Michael Knabe and Stano Paska who discovered and reported the issue.  - --- Henri Salo -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =1KRZ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
