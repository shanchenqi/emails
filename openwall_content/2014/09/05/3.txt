Release Date: April 10, Affected Versions: powermail: Version - Vulnerability Type: Captcha Bypass Severity: Low Suggested CVSS v2.0: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P/E:F/RL:O/RC:C Problem Description: The extension powermail offers the use of a captch validation to secure forms. It was possible to bypass the captcha validation and submit forms. Important Note: Other field validators weren't involved so any other validation worked as expected. Solution: Updated version is available from the TYPO3 extension manager and at Users of the extension are advised to update the extension as soon as possible as long as they use captchas in their forms. Credits: Credits go to Jigal van Hemert who discovered and reported this issue.  - --- Henri Salo -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =ZOfL -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
