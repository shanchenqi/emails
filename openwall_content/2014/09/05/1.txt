Yes, the email subject. "<problem> in <package>" seems reasonable, but when <package> is also the name of the main program in <package>, and the actual vuln is in a secondary program included with it, I think it's confusing. I'm not sure what percentage of procmail users also use formail along with it, but in general, there will be cases where <package> is extremely widely used but the program with the actual vulnerability of is obscure and mostly unused.
