If I am correct one CVEs is enough as both issues are about same Ajax dispatcher.   Release Date: February 12, Affected Versions: yag: Version and below, pt_extbase: Version and below Vulnerability Type: Access Bypass Severity: High Suggested CVSS v2.0: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C  Problem Description: The extension pt_extbase comes with an Ajax dispatcher for Extbase. Using this dispatcher it is possible to call every action in every controller of every Extbase extension installed on the system. The dispatcher failes to do access checks, thus it is possible to bypass access checks for Extbase Backend Modules like the backend user administration module. The extension yag also delivered an Ajax dispatcher, which was unused but vulnerable.  Important Note: The unused Ajax Dispatcher code in extension yag has been removed. If any other installed extensions made use of this dispatcher, it will stop working. Additionally the Ajax dispatcher in pt_extbase was modified to do access checks. Third party extensions using this dispatcher need to be added to the list of allowed actions.  Solution: Updated versions and are available from the TYPO3 extension manager and at and Users of the extension are advised to update the extension as soon as possible.  Credits: Credits go to Andrea Schmuttermair who discovered and reported this issue.  - --- Henri Salo -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =lMT7 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
