The overwrite happens before any ACL/community checks. There just needs an SNMP port to be configured.  The off-by-one happens on the heap, as buf is declared static. So depending on your compiler organizing the .bss this might be better or worse than being placed on the stack. :)  More info and a patch is here:    Sebastian  --   ~ perl self.pl ~ ~ krahmer@...e.de - SuSE Security Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
