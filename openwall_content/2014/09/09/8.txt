So for the sake of starting a conversation about tmp vulns on systems that shouldn't have any users or ways to exploit the tmp vuln I'm posting this one. Basically if a tree falls in the forest but no beavers were present does anyone care that a lumber jack might get squashed?  https://pypi.python.org/pypi/headintheclouds      remote_scripts_directory = '/tmp/bootstrap_scripts'     sudo('mkdir -p %s' % remote_scripts_directory)     for path in sorted(scripts):         filename = os.path.basename(path)         remote_script = '%s/%s' % (remote_scripts_directory, filename)         put('bootstrap/%s' % filename, remote_script, use_sudo=True)         run('source %s' % remote_script)    --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
