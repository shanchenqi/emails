Actually one reason I picked PyPI is simply because it has popularity/usage info, each package web page says how many times it was downloaded in the last day/week/month, so I picked a quick an easy audit of packages downloaded more than times in the last month.  Also this is to maybe help raise awareness of security a bit, things like tmp issues  1) shouldn't exist, especially in Python, mkstemp! mkdtemp! no need to reinvent attempts to create files securely, or to do it totally insecurely.  2) vendors should fix tmp, luckily this is happening, our PaaS OpenShift Enterprise, and the service OpenShift Online both use poly instantiated /tmp for each user cartridge (a cartridge is essentially on or more services/applications like PHP, MySQL, etc. being used to run something like say Wordpress). So the exploitation of tmp vulns on OpenShift would generally require additional vulnerabilities in order to get file system access (at which point a tmp vuln is likely not that interesting to an attacker, especially in the case of OpenShift and the way cartridges are restricted).   >   I did something similar looking for /tmp abuses in Debian >  packages, via a very very automated scan: >  >     >  >   Finding these issues was distressingly easy, and although in the >  real world the chances of significant impact are minimal they were >  genuine issues that should be reported and fixed.  Yup. Also this is a way to unwind, I know a lot of people that play computer card games like solitaire to wind down, looking at tmp vulns is essentially the same pleasantly monotonous experience, at least for me =).  Also a reminder:   has a specific list of the correct ways to do it, if I'm missing a language let me know and I'll add it.  > Steve > -- >   --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
