We see lots of people making the same mistakes over and over again.  Apart from the obvious newbie mistakes of failing to create proper temporary directories, we also get things like the slightly more subtle shipping a "secure" web server with a fixed self-signed cert.   Or copying a user-supplied string into a MAXPATH+1 buffer because that's long enough for any pathname.   Or ...  I don't need to go on, we've all seen them and Kurt highlighting problems is all goodness because at least it gets people thinking a bit more about security.  And we will need that because there are so many devices hitting the streets with so many noob vulns that it's only a matter of time before someone is killed.  jch  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
