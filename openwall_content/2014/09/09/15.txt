In my opinion these issues should be fixed in code and get CVE assigned even the risk is minimal.   Code audits for PyPi packages are more than welcome thought some level of coordination is required to avoid confusion. These are often easy to report and fix, but I understand if reporter has lack of time. Kurt if you need coordination help you can contact me off-list.
