This is because events may be bound when the ABI is in 2-level mode (e.g., by the toolstack before the domain is started).  The guest may trigger a Xen crash in evtchn_fifo_set_pending() if:    a) the event is bound to a VCPU without a control block; or   b) VCPU 0 does not have a control block.  In case (a), Xen will crash when looking up the current queue.  In (b), Xen will crash when looking up the old queue (which defaults to a queue on VCPU 0).  IMPACT ======  A buggy or malicious guest can crash the host.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen 4.4 and onward are vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  None.  CREDITS =======  This issue was originally reported by Vitaly Kuznetsov at Red Hat and diagnosed as a security issue by David Vrabel at Citrix.  NOTE REGARDING LACK OF EMBARGO ==============================  This bug was publicly reported on xen-devel, before it was appreciated that there was a security problem.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.         xen-unstable             Xen 4.4.x  $   $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =MQuU -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
