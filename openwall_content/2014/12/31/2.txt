This affects all versions supporting cram-md5, so and later.  Installations using authldap are *not* affected.  You should disable CRAM-MD5 in dbmail.conf if you store password encrypted.  A patch was already pushed to git both on dbmail.eu and github.  I'll release a patched version asap. ===========================================  Couldn'T get a hold of someone from security on IRC earlier so reporting a Bug.  In case of an unstable version being the only affected one what would be the best course of action? - I intend to package.mask later when I am on my dev box again (I never added and also I'D like to stable-req since I just added -- or would this warrant going for a faster STABLE-REQ of current with the security fix?  Please let me know what would be the preferred course of action from your point of view.  --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
