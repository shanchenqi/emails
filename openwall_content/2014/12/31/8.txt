Morgan" <tim.advisories@...ndspotsecurity.com> To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: Command Injection in mime-support/run-mailcap  Hello,  I discovered a shell injection vulnerability in the run-mailcap script of the mime-support package.  This vulnerability is exploitable in a variety of very specific scenarios when an attacker can convince a victim to open a file with a malicious file name using the run-mailcap script.  Only a handful of software packages (such as email clients) are likely to call run-mailcap directly, but it can also be called by xdg-open, which is much more widely used.  However, in the xdg-open case, the victim must not be using one of the popular desktop environments in order for the issue to be triggered.  In the xdg-open case, it was possible to execute arbitrary code using Google Chrome/Chromium file downloads as a vector.  (Yes, this is a separate issue from the xdg-open shell injection vulnerability that was reported not long ago.)  It seems that mime-support is primarily used by Debian-based Linux distributions, though FreeBSD does have a port for it.  I'm not sure what other distros may make it available.  Debian has released a security update for the issue.  I am also attaching patches which correct the flaw in the previous version.  Thanks to Salvatore Bonaccorso and Charles Plessy for developing the patches.  tim  View attachment of type "text/x-patch" bytes)  View attachment of type "text/x-patch" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
