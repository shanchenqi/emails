Thanks in advance  D. Regad MantisBT Developer http://www.mantisbt.org   1. XSS in extended project browser ==================================  MantisBT has two modes of operations to select the current project. The  second of these, so-called the "extended project browser", is vulnerable  to XSS attacks as the code did not check that a given subproject id is  indeed an integer.  This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Javascript code by forging  the MantisBT project cookie.  Affected versions:  >= <=  Fixed in versions: (not yet released)  Patch: See Github [1]  Credit: Issue was discovered by Paul Richards and fixed by Paul Richards and  Damien Regad.  References: Further details available in our issue tracker [2]  [1] [2]   2. XSS in projax_api.php ========================  The Projax library used in MantisBT 1.2.x does not properly escape html  strings. An attacker could take advantage of this to perform an XSS  attack using the profile/Platform field.  Affected versions:  >= <=  Fixed in versions: (not yet released)  Patch: See Github [3]  Credit: Issue was reported by Offensive Security via their bug bounty program  (http://www.offensive-security.com/bug-bounty-program/). It was fixed by Paul Richards.  References: Further details available in our issue tracker [4]  [3] [4]   3. XSS in admin panel / copy_field.php ======================================  Use of unsanitized parameters in this admin page allow an attacker to  execute arbitrary JavaScript code.  Affected versions: <=  Fixed in versions: (not yet released)  Patch: See Github [5]  Credit: Issue was reported by Mathias Karlsson (http://mathiaskarlsson.me) as  part of Offensive Security's bug bounty program [7]. It was fixed by Paul Richards.  References: Further details available in our issue tracker [6]  [5] [6] [7] http://www.offensive-security.com/bug-bounty-program/   4. XSS in string_insert_hrefs() ===============================  The URL matching regex in the string_insert_hrefs() function did not  validate the protocol, allowing an attacker to use 'javascript://' to  execute arbitrary code.  Affected versions:  >= <=  Fixed in versions: (not yet released)  Patch: See Github [8]  Credit: Issue was discovered by Mathias Karlsson (http://mathiaskarlsson.me) and  reported by Offensive Security (http://www.offensive-security.com/). It was fixed by Damien Regad (MantisBT Developer).  References: Further details available in our issue tracker [9]  [8] [9]   5. XSS in file uploads ======================  An attacker could upload a malicious Flash file renamed to bear a  recognized image extension (e.g. xss.swf ==> screenshot.png). Since by  default MantisBT is configured to allow images to be displayed inline,  it is possible to get the Flash to execute.  Affected versions: <=  Fixed in versions: (not yet released)  Patch: See Github [10]  Credit: Issue was reported by Mathias Karlsson (http://mathiaskarlsson.me) as  part of Offensive Security's bug bounty program [7]. It was fixed by Damien Regad with contribution from Victor Boctor  (MantisBT Developers).
