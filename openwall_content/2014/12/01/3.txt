An attacker able to supply a hive file of a small size to an application using the hivex library could use this flaw to read, and possibly write, up to bytes beyond the end of the allocated buffer, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution with the with the privileges of the user running that application. > > This issue has been fixed in upstream version of hivex.
