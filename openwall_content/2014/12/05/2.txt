Issue regarding copy fields - is a duplicate of  The report in issue referred to a security issue in "5. Reflected XSS in admin panel: PoC: [MantisBT]/admin/test_langs.php?dest_id=<script>alert(1)</script>"  At that point my response was "In terms of number 5 - are you sure you meant test_langs.php. In 1.3-master, there's an issue within copy_field.php of doing something similar of:  admin/copy_field.php?source_id=1&dest_id="></a><script>alert()</script><b style="" as I was already aware of an issue within copy_field.php  I should be able to supply a report confirming this later on.  The security researcher then came back and stated that he had indeed made an error in his report and he did not mean test_langs.php  In this case, the line:  "Credit: Issue was reported by Mathias Karlsson (http://mathiaskarlsson.me) as part of Offensive Security's bug bounty program [7]. It was fixed by Paul Richards."  is in correct as the issue was identified by myself initially, then subsequently identified (incorrectly) in the initial bug report.  As I need to be able to do a security bulletin regarding my find for the XSS within copy_field.php, can you please tell me what CVE identifier to use for this and  ensure proper attribution?
