The issue with ?return= was something that I've previously complained about, and the development team chose not to fix at the time.     The CVE indicator of makes it appear that the vulnerability was first identified in but in fact, it's one that's been known about since a lot earlier - but previous developers argued not to fix I believe (I'll need to pull out a old HDD and go for chat logs to confirm).     For example, I have test web requests stored demonstrating this issue since at least April (http://tinypic.com/r/k0pee/8) , and I believe that actually the identification of this issue pre-dates this.      Therefore, I don’t believe it is correct to state that the issue was first reported by “Mathias Karlsson” in May when it was identified as an issue prior to April     Equally, I don’t believe that putting in the description “Paul Richards also found another redirection issue in permalink_page.php, which turned out to have the same root cause.” is a valid indication of the issue - in terms of the ?return parameter, Mantis used the same functionality in around 4-5 pages.     In addition, whilst I did state that I would leave testing of the fix to someone else, the final fix for this issue looks rather similar to the proposal fix I suggested for further testing of:     <paulr>          if ( preg_match( '@^(?P<path>' . preg_quote( $t_path, '@' ) . ')' . $t_pattern . '$@', $t_url, $t_matches ) ) {  <paulr>                  $t_type = 1;  <paulr> -        } else if ( preg_match( '@^(?P<path>' . preg_quote( $t_short_path, '@' ) . ')' . $t_pattern . '$@', $t_url, $t_matches ) ) {  <paulr> +        } else if ( $t_short_path != '' && ( preg_match( '@^(?P<path>' . preg_quote( $t_short_path, '@' ) . ')' . $t_pattern . '$@', $t_url, $t_matches ) ) ) {  <paulr>                  $t_type = 2;  <paulr>          } else if ( preg_match( '@^(?P<path>)' . $t_pattern . '$@', $t_url, $t_matches ) ) {  <paulr>                  $t_type = 3;  <paulr>          }  <paulr>    <paulr> not directly related or well  <paulr> i'm wondering if the above would be correct or not ;p     Paul           -----Original Message----- From: Damien Regad [mailto:dregad@...tisbt.org]  Sent: 03 December To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: [oss-security] URL redirection issue in MantisBT     Greetings,     Please update with the information below        Description:     A bug in the URL sanitization routine allows an attacker to craft an URL that can redirect outside of the MantisBT instance's domain when the software is installed at the web server's root.     e.g.  <http://example.com/login_page.php?return=http://google.com> http://example.com/login_page.php?return=http://google.com will redirect to Google.     Affected versions:  => <=     Fixed in versions:  (not yet released)     Patch:  See Github [1]     Credit:     Redirection in login_page.php was first reported [3] by Mathias Karlsson  ( <http://mathiaskarlsson.me> http://mathiaskarlsson.me) as part of Offensive Security's bug bounty program [4]; issue was also independently discovered and reported by Ryan Giobbi who made the original CVE request [2], Shahee Mirza [5] and Alejo Popovici [6].     Paul Richards also found another redirection issue in permalink_page.php, which turned out to have the same root cause.     The issue was fixed by Damien Regad (MantisBT Developer).
