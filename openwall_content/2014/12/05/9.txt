The thread indicates that the poster asked for review of his patch and never got one. Any gcc people here who could comment?  Do you have numbers on the performance impact? Or some good ideas what would be reasonable benchmarking targets? As libraries are pic-compiled anyway from my limited understanding I think this only affects code in the main executables. I saw that chrome already ships pie-binaries, firefox doesn't.

"somewhwat complex" seems to be a reasonable description when it comes to this whole topic of memory exploit mitigation :-) I feel I'd like to know more about this but easy-to-grasp documentation / talks etc. are hard to find.   --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
