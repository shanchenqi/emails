If this is true then could we at > least have all major distros enable it on 64 bit?  Copy relocations support has still be added to GCC.  For a patch  exists:      Without that, there is still a performance impact.  > What i found notable: diff-ing two function offsets from different > libraries (I use printf-sin) is alway static, even on Pax. Is this by > design?  Yes, the address you get is the PLT stub, not the actual implementation.    The reason for this is somewhat complex, but related to the way lazy  binding and symbol interposition are implemented.  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
