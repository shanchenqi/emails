And nik-picking here, but the issue that I identified in permalink_page.php I believe was a cross site scripting issue and not a URL redirection vulnerability so should probably be allocated a separate CVE identifier?  The http request headers of the permalink_page.php issue that I recall are at and relate to a XSS vulnerability and not a URL Redirection as shown in the image linked.
