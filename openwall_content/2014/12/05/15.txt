If you feel this is a completely wrong way to benchmark this I'm open to suggestions. *  I decided a reasonable target would be a static compile of ffmpeg, because it does some complicated stuff. I compiled two copies mostly identical with the difference that for one I passed CFLAGS="-O2" LDFLAGS="" while for the other I passed CFLAGS="-O2 -fpic" LDFLAGS="-pie".  I then converted a video to mpeg4.  This is what I got: no pie/pic: average: pie/pic: average:  So it seems the difference is at least measurable (around 1,4%) but not big.  I haven't benchmarked with the patches Florian referred to, they involve patching gold and gcc (the above is done with classic ld).  --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
