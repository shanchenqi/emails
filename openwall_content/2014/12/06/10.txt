A far better mechanism in Nautilus would be to use execve(2) on the pathname and see if it executes. Nautilus will never be good at guessing which files are actually executable on a given system and it is ridiculous for it to try to guess. It should just execute the selected file and if that fails, report the failure to the user.  One goofy filemanager doing something silly ought not stop Mozilla from shipping a safer Firefox.
