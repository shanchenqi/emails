I'm not really sure, but based on the output I assume nautilus is relying on file or libmagic to assess the file type.  And that's what fails: $ file --mime-type pie pie: application/x-sharedlib   It seems there is no really easy way to separate executables from shared libraries and whether this should be considered a bug in file/libmagic. The only thing I quickly found that would be possible is searching if a SONAME is present. libmagic uses some "magic" file format to parse files, I don't know if that's capable of such complex parsing.  (oh, btw, this is one more reason to wipe out potential security bugs in file...)  --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
