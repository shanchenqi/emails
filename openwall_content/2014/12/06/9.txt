Yup, it's a pretty lame excuse.  Firefox is only looking at using ASLR for the first time in and it lost to supporting the workflow of opening Nautilus, navigating to some directory and double-clicking the binary (could just be a wrapper...) rather than using the .desktop file (or the CLI, or $LAUNCHER) or shipping a script for this.  It's sad. Even if GNOME decides to add another hack to make this work, it'll be 6 months to get it released and another 2-3 years before Mozilla considers using it.  Meanwhile, plenty of other corporations (Valve, Google, [...]) are shipping PIE binaries without trouble - their user-facing app launchers even have icons, i18n and more in Nautilus, because they're not raw binaries.
