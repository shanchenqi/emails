Hi guys,  As you know Hector Marco disclosured a new attack targeting the GNU/Linux mitigation defensive technology earlier this week: http://cybersecurity.upv.es/attacks/offset2lib/offset2lib.html  Paper & slide: http://cybersecurity.upv.es/attacks/offset2lib/offset2lib-presentation.pdf  http://cybersecurity.upv.es/attacks/offset2lib/offset2lib-paper.pdf  Hector provides 3 possible solutions:  1, Use Grsecurity/PaX. Afaik, Gentoo and Debian Mempo has long-term maintainence for Grsecurity/PaX patch. But the Grsecurity/PaX is not party of linux kernel mainline that'd be a problem to the most distros. I think linux kernel upstream won't accept PaX patch only because of this *kind* of issue.  2, ASLRv3? Hector Marco( the dude who disclosured offset2lib attack) sent a patch to the upstream:  Even the upstream don't accept the patch, is this possible to backport it & maintain it for distro community?  3, RenewSSP? IMOHO, this is a solution for the way of exploit like:  It'd be workaround for another mitigation to prevent offset2lib attack though. But the authors of RenewSSP don't even send a patch to GCC community yet. At least I can't search anything about RenewSSP in GCC ml.  It seems ASLRv3 is the best option we have? Or anything else?   --  GNU powered it... GPL protect it... God blessing it...  regards Shawn  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
