That won't work well for OpenBSD; libressl uses a random value instead of the timestamp. Using tlsdate against such a server:  V: In TLS response, V: In TLS response, V: In TLS response, V: In TLS response, V: In TLS response, V: In TLS response,  There are certainly reasons you might not want to expose exact server time of a general purpose server, e.g. passing time(NULL) to srand is very common, but that's another can of worms (we also had some changes in that area recently)..  As far as NTP goes, OpenNTP does at least send cookies in some fields and check returned valuess, mitigating against blind spoofing. For sure it's not perfect, but requires no configuration and is better than not doing it.
