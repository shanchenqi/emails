Hi,  So we know now that the default ntp implementation most people use has some severe security vulnerabilities. And some people think we should either rewrite it or use the one from openbsd.  A strange discussion. Because ntp is insecure by design. It is an unauthenticated, insecure protocol that is suspectible to man-in-the-middle-attacks. Frankly, I don't care which implementation of an insecure protocol has less buffer overflows.  This is not a theoretical problem: https://github.com/PentesterES/Delorean   Is there any reason not to tell everyone to use tlsdate? What's the distro's take on this? afaik many ship ntp-based solutions by default.
