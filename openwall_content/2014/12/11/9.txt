I say this as most kernel subsystems do not use bugzilla.kernel.org (USB and Networking are two examples), while others use it heavily (like ACPI).  For "core" issues like this, stick to the mailing lists, they work better.  Actually, for "security" stuff, use the security@...nel.org alias, that's the best way to get a quick response.  thanks,  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
