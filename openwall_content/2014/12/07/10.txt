If so, please provide details as to why you feel this way.  The Linux kernel developers take security very seriously, otherwise no one would be using Linux for "secure" systems, right?  > Developer/users could take bear of performance penalty caused > by new features, but I don't think most developers/users would accept > even 1% performance penalty caused by security defensive mitigation. > Personally, I hope we could see Grsecurity/PaX being part of mainline > linux kernel in the future.  Great, please do the work to split it up and submit it to be merged, that would be a wonderful thing for you to do if you think the features there are needed.  > IMOHO, offset2lib is a very critical impact to the GNU/Linux > mitigation.

The fact that this option isn't enabled by lots of distros already means that there isn't much of an issue, right?  thanks,  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
