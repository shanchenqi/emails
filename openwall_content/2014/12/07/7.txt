I think you got tricked by either umask or an existing file that was already created with other permissions before, because here it looks like this:  $ pg_dump --version pg_dump (PostgreSQL) $  $ umask  $ pg_dump postgres > postgres1.sql $ ls -l postgres1.sql -rw-r--r--. 1 postgres postgres Dec  7 postgres1.sql $   $ umask $ umask  $ pg_dump postgres > postgres2.sql $ ls -l postgres2.sql -rw-------. 1 postgres postgres Dec  7 postgres2.sql $   But:   $ touch postgres3.sql $ chmod postgres3.sql $ pg_dump postgres > postgres3.sql $ ls -l postgres3.sql -rw-r--r--. 1 postgres postgres Dec  7 postgres3.sql $  > In my opinion it deserves a cve.  I do not know which behaviour you are exactly seeing (and for which version of PostgreSQL) but above seems absolutely fine to me.
