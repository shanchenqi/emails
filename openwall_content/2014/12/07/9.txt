That's not a good comparison, as who knows what those config options do.  And a "well written" option will never have a CONFIG_* option within the .c files, as that's not the normal way to implement features in the Linux kernel.  > Is Hector Marco's ASLRv3 submission a much simpler reinvention of PaX's > ASLR wheel, or is it rather a smaller wheel which does less than PaX's > improved, field-tested ASLR does ?  I don't know, never looked at the PaX code, sorry.  Why not look at it yourself and compare it?  > If the latter, I think it wouldn't be good to see another half-measure > integrated to mainline, until the next mainline ASLR defeat against > which PaX has protected for over a decade. Just my 2 cents.  The reason PaX isn't in the main kernel tree is that no one has spent the time and effort to actually submit it in a mergable form.  So please, do so if you think this is something that is needed.  thanks,  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
