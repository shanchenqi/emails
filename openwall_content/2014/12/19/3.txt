If a client uses an "official" git library and inherits the vulnerability from that code, then is appropriate based on shared libraries / codebases.  If there are other git clients that work with the git "protocol" but contain independently-written code (i.e. a separate implementation), and those clients are vulnerable, then each implementation should receive its own ID.  - Steve   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
