There are many documented code execution opportunities (some of them  still rather subtle), so I find any arguments based on the existence of  a hypothetical secure procmailrc file generator not very convincing.  :0 |echo code execution >/dev/tty  :0 * ?echo code execution >/dev/tty /dev/null  âŚ and so on.  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
