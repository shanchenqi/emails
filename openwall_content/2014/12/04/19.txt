The problem appears when the executable is PIE compiled and it has an address leak belonging to the executable. We named this weakness: offset2lib.  In this scenario, an attacker is able to de-randomize all mmapped areas (libraries, mapped files, etc.) by knowing only an address belonging to the application and the offset2lib value.  We have built a PoC which bypasses on a 64 bit Linux system, the three most widely adopted and effective protection techniques: No-eXecutable bit (NX), address space layout randomization (ASLR) and stack smashing protector (SSP). The exploit obtains a remote shell in less than one second.  We have proposed the ASLRv3 which is a small Linux patch which removes the offset2lib weakness.  Details of the weakness, steps to exploit the offset2lib weakness, a working proof of concept exploit, recommendations and a demonstrative video has  been publish at: http://cybersecurity.upv.es/attacks/offset2lib/offset2lib.html   Hector Marco.  http://cybersecurity.upv.es   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
