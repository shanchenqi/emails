Following the submission guidelines[1], please send your ASLRv3 patch to upstream at linux-kernel@...r.kernel.org and CC the following people:  	Andrew Morton <akpm@...ux-foundation.org> 	Thomas Gleixner <tglx@...utronix.de> 	Ingo Molnar <mingo@...hat.com> 	"H. Peter Anvin" <hpa@...or.com> 	Russell King <linux@....linux.org.uk> 	Catalin Marinas <catalin.marinas@....com> 	Will Deacon <will.deacon@....com> 	Oleg Nesterov <oleg@...hat.com> 	Andy Lutomirski <luto@...capital.net> 	Kees Cook <keescook@...omium.org>  I noticed in testing that this hugely reduces the available mmap space available to 32-bit processes. I suspect this is what this wasn't done before.
