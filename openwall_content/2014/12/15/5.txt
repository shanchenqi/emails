As there was not really much feedback from the vserver side and as there are quite more issues with vserver I hoped to get rid of all those issues using LXC. At least issue 3 is also with lxc-attach is quite the same, but documentation of lxc-attach does not mention the risks either (at least on Ubuntu). Calling  # lxc-attach --name buildhost-trusty -- /bin/ls  will create file outside when e.g. /bin/ls was replaced with  /root/TtyPushbackSignaling --NoSignal -- "touch /xxx"  So I guess one should not use attach to run e.g. automatic updates in the guest or something alike.
