Absolutely. Lintian has a check for RPATH (but not for RUNPATH, AFAICT);  alas, it doesn't distinguish between security and non-security problems: https://lintian.debian.org/tags/binary-or-shlib-defines-rpath.html (NB, this is where I spotted the bug.)  I requested a separate tag for relative RPATH a while ago: Now we "only" need someone to write the code. :-)  >(If that exists, how did it get missed? If not, could it be added? >Where? https://wiki.debian.org/qa.debian.org).  The wiki page has a link to lintian.debian.org.  --  Jakub Wilk  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
