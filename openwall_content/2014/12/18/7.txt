Do we need an embargo for the secondary issues, or can we just make them  public immediately?  I would strongly prefer the latter.  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
