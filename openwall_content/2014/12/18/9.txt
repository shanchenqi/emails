I would strongly prefer the latter.  Based on experience, I'd say the latter is the best course of action. Known issues tend to attract more eyes and make the discovery of the secondary issues more likely.  The line is probably going to be more difficult to be drawn if the CVSS score of the secondary issues bump due to, say, easier exploitability.
