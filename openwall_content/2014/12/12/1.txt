Note that today we also saw the release of Docker also containing these fixes. While version is a security-focused update, Docker includes over new commits, primarily bug fixes.  It is highly recommended that users upgrade to Docker Engine or higher.  Please send any questions to security@...ker.com <mailto:security@...ker.com>.    Docker Security Advisory ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ============================================================= Path traversal during processing of absolute symlinks =============================================================  Path traversal attacks are possible in the processing of absolute symlinks. In checking symlinks for traversals, only relative links were considered. This allowed path traversals to exist where they should have otherwise been prevented. This was exploitable via both archive extraction and through volume mounts.  This vulnerability allowed malicious images or builds from malicious Dockerfiles to write files to the host system and escape containerization, leading to privilege escalation.  We are releasing Docker to address this vulnerability. Users are highly encouraged to upgrade.  Discovered by Tõnis Tiigi.  =================================================================== Escalation of privileges during decompression of LZMA (.xz) archives ===================================================================  It has been discovered that the introduction of chroot for archive extraction in Docker had introduced a privilege escalation vulnerability.  Malicious images or builds from malicious Dockerfiles could escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code as a privileged root user on the Docker host by providing a malicious ‘xz’ binary.  We are releasing Docker to address this vulnerability. Only Docker is vulnerable. Users are highly encouraged to upgrade.  Discovered by Tõnis Tiigi.  ========================================================================= Path traversal and spoofing opportunities presented through image identifiers =========================================================================  It has been discovered that Docker does not sufficiently validate Image IDs as provided either via 'docker load' or through registry communications.  This allows for path traversal attacks, causing graph corruption and manipulation by malicious images, as well as repository spoofing attacks.  We are releasing Docker to address this vulnerability. Users are highly encouraged to upgrade.  Discovered by Eric Windisch of Docker, Inc.
