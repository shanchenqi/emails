Especially with Out-Of-Memory killer which is on most servers and that will actually kill your daemons before they can crash due to the lack of memory.  Or you can even disable your server swap abilities (vm.swappiness) to always keep all your applications in memory, which will trigger OOM killer even faster. - --  Pierre Schweitzer <pierre@...ctos.org> System & Network Administrator Senior Kernel Developer ReactOS Deutschland e.V. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =mYid -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
