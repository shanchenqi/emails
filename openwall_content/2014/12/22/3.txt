I don't think this contradicts my statement that average consumer hw doesn't need the high accuracy of ntp :-)  > So it's not an either/or situation (care about security, or have > accurate time, sometimes we need both).  Yeah, I totally agree that this would be the desired thing to have. However the facts are that at the moment we don't. And imho for consumer HW the slight inaccuracy of tlsdate doesn't matter, while the insecurity of ntp does (as the very practical hsts attack has shown).  I read these days that the Linux foundation is sponsoring some work on NTP. Anyone involved in this and can comment whether secure authentication for NTP is something that's being looked at or if it is only about creating a better implementation of the ntp software?   --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
