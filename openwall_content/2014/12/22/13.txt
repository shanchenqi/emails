Speaking as one who had to feed and water an OpenLDAP system that was  replicating all over the world, I really cared whether *this* event  happened before or after *that* event, but yeah, most users don't need to  do that.  You haven't lived until you've debugged a replication problem; "Boss, are  both these systems running NTP?"  "Yes, Dave."  "Right, in that case, I've  found another obscure bug in OpenLDAP."  When you've got more than one  person updating the same object at around the same time, it was really  helpful, in an LDAP sense, to know the precise order of events, as the  whole concept of replication depends upon it.  I suspect that we humans, the geekier we become, the more precise are our  perceived needs; just listen to any time announcement over the telephone:  "At the third stroke, it will be six o'clock precisely" (with the precise  bit happening at the start of the third beep, and I was fanatic over  that).  --  Dave Horsfall DTM (VK2KFU)  "Bliss is a MacBook with a FreeBSD server." http://www.horsfall.org/spam.html (and check the home page whilst you're there)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
