A split made between the software that the "average consumer" uses and the software that prosumers and professionals use for basic system services like timekeeping. We should all be be using the good stuff...  >From what has been said so far, there appears to be two sides:  One that points out that security in ntp is week therefore MITM attacks can be done. So the idea is to remove ntp and replace it something else, which would be using the time field in TLS transactions. Most arguments seem to come from the assuming the TLS servers are secure and have the correct time. Nothing has be said about how well the TLS servers would work as time servers  The other points out that ntp is a time protocol that specializes in getting and keeping time correct. It is designed to allow time to be set with high level of precision and accuracy (milliseconds on regular systems, microseconds when it really matters).  Has there been any studies on the quality of TLS for a timeserver? From comments, to me, it looks like the TLS side is rationalizing the 1 second limit on TLS because they want want to use TLS as is, without further researching/refining the topic.  If we are going to build a secure time protocol, the timekeeping piece is at least as important as the security piece.    > > So it's not an either/or situation (care about security, or have > > accurate time, sometimes we need both). > > Yeah, I totally agree that this would be the desired thing to have. > However the facts are that at the moment we don't.

We can't trust the web server that we are trying to connect to, as if it is a MITM attack, it could also have bad time.
