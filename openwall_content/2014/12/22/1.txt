I perfectly understand that some people need more accuracy than tlsdate can give. However it's probably rare, right? I don't see any reason why average consumer hardware (Desktop, smartphone etc.) would have any problem with the 1-2 sec max inaccuracy of tlsdate.  > Reconciling this with cryptography is certainly a challenge.

Then the only thing you really need is a single authentication operation (HMAC or whatever). That shouldn't delay by any significant amount.  > I think most desktop-based distributions could get away with something > like tlsdate. >  > In contrast, servers with long-running connections and I/O polling > loops often do not react gracefully to jumps in time.

Haven't tested though.   --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
