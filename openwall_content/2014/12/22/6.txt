The log files you're trying to reconcile may be from machines on different continents as well which is why ntp is so useful: everyone has the same idea of time.  The potential for an added or removed second at end of of June and December can cause some excitement.  I've also known a one or two second discrepancy break 'make'.   That was probably more to do with the fragility of that particular build system rather than a a clock synchronization issue, but the point is that properly accurate time is important to a lot of people.  jch -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =fN2l -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
