Having to reconcile multiple logs/events across widely distributed systems, especially in high volume situations, 1-2 seconds is a deal breaker. Or people running SCADA systems for industrial plants. Or people that run financial systems. A lot of them care very much about security, and require accurate time, or else there's really no point to this all.  To say nothing of a post incident forensics response, where loose time would make things a lot harder to figure out.  So it's not an either/or situation (care about security, or have accurate time, sometimes we need both).  --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
