This is due to incorrect GMP documentation for mpn_set_str about the size of a buffer (discussion is at [1]; first fix in the GMP documentation is at [2]). This bug is present in the MPFR versions from (adding mpfr_strtofr) to this one, and can be detected by running "make check" in a 32-bit ABI under GNU/Linux with alloca disabled (this is currently possible by using the --with-gmp-build configure option where alloca has been disabled in the GMP build). It is fixed by the strtofr patch [3]. Corresponding changeset in the 3.1 branch: [4].  [1]: [2]: [3]: [4]:  References: - -  Can a CVE be assigned to this please?
