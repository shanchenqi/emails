Don't give me wrong, I love GNU/Linux( GCC/GLIBC/KERNEL), which are fundamentals of the FOSS ecosystem. I've been always telling my customers/friends that GNU/Linux( with vanilla kernel) is more secure than M$-windows. But Grsecurity/PaX is the must-need stuff to those who has some digital assets in a critical scene.  >> Developer/users could take bear of performance penalty caused >> by new features, but I don't think most developers/users would accept >> even 1% performance penalty caused by security defensive mitigation. >> Personally, I hope we could see Grsecurity/PaX being part of mainline >> linux kernel in the future. > > Great, please do the work to split it up and submit it to be merged, > that would be a wonderful thing for you to do if you think the features > there are needed. > I wish I could.

What do you mean about "this option isn't enabled"? The most of suid programs has been shipped with these mitigations: NX/ASLR/PIE/STACK CANARY/FORTIFY...some are compiled with RELRO. What I mean is this issue should be fixed by the upstream, not let distro community to maintain a tiny patch.  > thanks, > > greg k-h    --  GNU powered it... GPL protect it...
