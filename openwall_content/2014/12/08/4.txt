ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The current read/write lock implementation is read-biased, which allows a consistent stream of readers to starve writers indefinitely.  There are certain rwlocks where guests are capable of applying arbitrary read pressure.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest administrator can deny service to other tasks.  If the NMI watchdog is active, a timeout might be triggered, resulting in a host crash.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen 4.2 and later systems are vulnerable.  Xen 4.1 and earlier are not vulnerable in normal configurations.  4.1 and earlier are vulnerable only insofar as features are used which have already been explicitly discounted for security support purposes (TMEM, see XSA-15; XSM-based radical disaggregation, see XSA-77).  Only x86 systems offer avenues for attacking this vulnerability. ARM systems do not and are therefore not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  There is no mitigation available for this issue.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Andrew Cooper of Citrix.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue in practice for most systems.  refers to these fixed cases.)  In some deployments, large guests (more than around VCPUs) may still be able to trigger intermittent problems; a complete fix to this issue requires substantial structural changes and is planned for Xen 4.6.  refers to these yet-to-be-fixed cases.)                  xen-unstable             Xen 4.4.x             Xen 4.3.x             Xen 4.2.x  $     $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =V6/o -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
