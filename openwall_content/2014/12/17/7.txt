This paragraph suggests so many things which are simply wrong, confused, or irrelevant that i don't know what to make of the rest of the article.   * modern debian GNU/Linux systems do not have a wheel group at all.  No particular versions or flavors of "Linux system"   * on systems where members of group wheel really do have unrestricted access to the su command, having wheel in the first place *is* the vulnerability -- it is a misconfiguration to expect an account to be non-privileged if it is a member of wheel.   * the last sentence appears to be about setuid/setgid binaries, but makes no mention that the overwhelming majority of binaries are not setuid/setgid.  Later on, the post suggests that wheel group membership is related to sudo privileges.  It also seems to assume that polkit always permits access for members of group wheel.  I can find no such configuration on a modern debian system.  I don't think there's anything significant in this ambiguous, underspecified, and confused report.  	--dkg   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
