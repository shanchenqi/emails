I don't see a CVE for to this anywhere; can one please be assigned?  """ RabbitMQ introduced a mechanism (the 'loopback_users' configuration item) allowing access for some users to be restricted to only connect via localhost. By default the "guest" user is restricted in this way.  Unfortunately, the HTTP framework used by the management plugin trusts the easily-forged "X-Forwarded-For" header when determining the remote address. It is therefore possible to subvert this access control mechanism for the HTTP API. Attackers would still need to know or guess the username and password.
