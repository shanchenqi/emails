These issues are different from the  POSIX-mandated shell escape in email bodies (“~!”), which most  implementations switch off when the input is not a terminal.  There are two main branches of mailx these days, Heirloom mailx and BSD  mailx.  Heirloom mailx appears defunct upstream.  For BSD mailx, OpenBSD seems the canonical source these days.  I  discussed these issues with Todd Miller, who kindly provided patches for  their version.  *** Heirloom mailx ***  For Heirloom mailx, the numbered patches address the following issues:  Do not recognize paths, mail folders, and pipes in mail addresses  by default.  That avoids a direct command injection with syntactically  valid email addresses starting with “|”.  Such addresses can be specified both on the command line, the mail  headers (with “-t”) or in address lines copied over from previous mail  while replying.  This was assigned for some versions of BSD mailx.  It is  documented behavior for Heirloom mailx, and was mentioned in an old  technical report about BSD mailx (which does not usually make its way  into operating system installations).  The patch switches off this  processing and updates the documentation.  When invoking sendmail, prevent option processing for email  address arguments.  This prevents changing e.g. the Postfix  configuration file in unexpected ways.  This behavior was documented for  BSD mailx (sort of), but not for Heirloom mailx.  We did not assign a  CVE to this because it is more of a missing feature, and code invoking  mailx needs adjustment in the caller as well.  Make wordexp support mandatory.  (No functional change.)  Prevent command execution in the expand function, which is IMHO  unexpected.  (Not really required with patch 1, and there is still  information disclosure/DoS potential if this expansion occurs.)  This is  a historic vulnerability already fixed in the Debian package,  retroactively assigned       (The Heirloom patch is slightly different because of the existing use of  wordexp.)  *** BSD mailx ***  The unnumbered patches are for BSD mailx.  Their order is: remove_T,  minus_f, mail_glob, expandaddr, nosendmail.  remove_T and minus_f have  already been committed.  The remaining three roughly correspond to my  patches and  The previous BSD mailx code seems to have an implicit dependency of a  non-option-reordering getopt.  (BSD getopt does not recognize options  after non-option arguments, GNU getopt does.)  I think the minus_f patch  only improves matters in this regard.  *** Fixing applications ***  Applications calling mailx with untrusted addresses which can start with  “-” still need updating to use “--”.  This is sadly not compatible with  older mailx versions lacking the equivalent of patch  However,  directly calling “/usr/sbin/sendmail -i -t” with a self-constructed  email header will work on almost all systems.  Option processing is risky for two reasons: Some of the options are  plainly harmful (e.g., “-Sexpandaddr=@...mple.com”).  Others can be used  to mask email addresses, which means that mailx enters read mode, where  you can run shells using the “!” escape (which is especially problematic  if mailx is used to send mail with partially attacker-controlled content).  For Heirloom mailx, I tried to work around this, but both Sebastian  Krahmer and Todd Miller helpfully pointed out that I missed some  options, and that the whole approach is unlikely to work, ever.  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security   View attachment of type "text/x-patch" bytes)  View attachment of type "text/x-patch" bytes)  View attachment of type "text/x-patch" bytes)  View attachment of type "text/x-patch" bytes)  View attachment "remove_T" of type "text/plain" bytes)  View attachment "minus_f" of type "text/plain" bytes)  View attachment "mail_glob" of type "text/plain" bytes)  View attachment "expandaddr" of type "text/plain" bytes)  View attachment "nosendmail" of type "text/plain" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
