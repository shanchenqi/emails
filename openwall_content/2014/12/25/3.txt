It's typical to require at least 1/2 second accuracy for log correlation.  This is not just for some people, but (for an example) at academic  institutions where the staff is running average consumer hardware.  tlsdate is certainly an OK boundary sanity check on more accurate time, or for  initial stepping on a new boot or new clock start.
