Two of them I think should have CVE's:  * bug / - A missing csrf check could allow reflected xss on wikis that allow raw html  * bug / - MediaWiki's <cross-domain-policy> mangling could allow an article editor to inject code into api consumers that blindly unserialize php representations of the page from the api  Could those be assigned?
