Affected versions: => <=  Fixed in versions: (not yet released)  Patch: See Github [1]  Credit:  Redirection in login_page.php was first reported [3] by Mathias Karlsson  (http://mathiaskarlsson.me) as part of Offensive Security's bug bounty  program [4]; issue was also independently discovered and reported by  Ryan Giobbi who made the original CVE request [2], Shahee Mirza [5] and  Alejo Popovici [6].  Paul Richards also found another redirection issue in  permalink_page.php, which turned out to have the same root cause.  The issue was fixed by Damien Regad (MantisBT Developer).
