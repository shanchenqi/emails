I generated some values and, while distribution is not perfect, it feels  fairly unpredictable :  $ wc -l VDSO-ASLR.lst; cat VDSO-ASLR.lst |sort |uniq -c |sort -n -r  |head; sort -u VDSO-ASLR.lst |wc -l VDSO-ASLR.lst       12       11       11       11       11       11       11       11       11       10  This is different results over samples, with a very light  shift toward the shown addresses.  What's weird, though, is that a run of the same set through Burp Suite  analysis tells me that there are at best 8 estimated bits of effective  entropy. This suggests, if my interpretation is correct, that there may be some  weakness (by calculating adjacent and/or subsequent values) allowing to  find a valid combination under tries.    I'm not a cryptologist so I may be missing a point here, but I think  it's worth discussing.
