These fixes mostly silence compiler warnings, but also fix at least one bug in calculating buffer sizes that could result in false failures or allowing overflows.  These added patches are:  dbe: Call to DDX SwapBuffers requires address of int, not unsigned int  pt. 2]  glx: Can't mix declarations and code in X.org sources pt. 9]  Missing parens in REQUEST_FIXED_SIZE macro pt. 5]  dix: GetHosts bounds check using wrong pointer value pt. 6]  They are also included with all the earlier patches in the list now posted to:   Since these additional commits went into the X.Org master repo as part of the same pull request as the earlier fixes, X.Org considers them to be part of the fix for the CVE's in this advisory and does not believe new CVE id's are warranted as X.Org distributed no version of its code in which only part of these fixes were present.  --  	-Alan Coopersmith-              alan.coopersmith@...cle.com 	 Oracle Solaris Engineering - http://blogs.oracle.com/alanc  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
