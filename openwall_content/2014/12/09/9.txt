Any other implementations you are interested in?  Vanilla djbdns manages a counter called ‘loop’ (look for ‘z->loop’ in the code); if this counter hits it simply aborts the current query. This is similar to the fixes now present in PowerDNS, BIND and Unbound.  Breakpoint 4, doit <u>, state=1) at  if (++z->loop == goto DIE; 1: z->loop = 99 (gdb) cont Continuing.  It then logs 'drop 1 input/output error’ and aborts resolution of this query. Note that it actually drops the query, the client will eventually timeout; PowerDNS Recursor sends a SERVFAIL, and I presume so do BIND and Unbound.
