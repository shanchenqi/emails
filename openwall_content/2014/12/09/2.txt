Just read the ELF program headers that you can find at the base address of the executable to find the PT_DYNAMIC segment. In that segment, find the DT_DEBUG entry, which will give you a pointer to a r_debug struct, which definition you can find in /usr/include/link.h.  That struct has a r_map member that gives you a linked list of libraries the dynamic linker (ld.so) loaded, with the base address for each of them.  Those data structures are used by gdb, so removing the DT_DEBUG pointer would break debugging with gdb.
