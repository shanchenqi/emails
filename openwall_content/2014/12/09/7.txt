I apologize for any newbie mistakes.  PLEASE NOTE:  We are the open-source inheritor of what was once OpenSolaris's OS/Net consolidation (i.e. the kernel, system libraries, and system commands).  WE ARE NOT RELATED TO ORACLE or ORACLE SOLARIS.  Illumos bug -  which is now fixed in the upstream illumos-gate, is an innocuous fix to a serious problem that allows an arbitrary user in the global zone (non-global zones are not able to panic the machine) to panic the machine.  Illumos has various distributions from various parties.  These include, but are not limited to:  	OmniOS from OmniTI 	SmartOS from Joyent 	NexentaStor from Nexenta 	The OpenIndiana project 	Coraid  Because SmartOS presents non-global zones to its non-administrative users, it is not a high-priority for them.  For OmniOS and OpenIndiana, it is more critical.  OmniOS has updated its packaging servers for all supported releases:  and bloody.  Merely issuing "pkg update" and rebooting will fix the problem.  Users still on should upgrade to ASAP.  SmartOS has standard upgrade procedures.  Other distros' contacts are Bcc:ed here.  They will contact me if they have updates.  Thank you! Daniel L.
