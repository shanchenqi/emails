Details as follows:  It was found that RPM wrote file contents to the target installation  directory under a temporary name, and verified its cryptographic  signature only after the temporary file has been written completely.  Under certain conditions, the system interprets the unverified temporary  file contents and extracts commands from it. This could allow an  attacker to modify signed RPM files in such a way that they would  execute code chosen by the attacker during package installation.  Reference:  It was found that RPM could encounter an integer overflow, leading to a  stack-based overflow, while parsing a crafted CPIO header in the payload  section of an RPM file.  This could allow an attacker to modify signed  RPM files in such a way that they would execute code chosen by the  attacker during package installation.
