I have not checked if any implementations are vulnerable, but could  MITRE please confirm if its ok to reuse this CVE if any crypto-libs are  found vulnerable, or if they plan to assign another CVE id?   --  Huzaifa Sidhpurwala / Red Hat Product Security Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
