I don't think it has ever changed. CLOCK_MONOTONIC won't *ever* jump either forwards or backwards, but is impacted by clock skew. I don't think most use cases actually want CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW, especially considering that there's no vdso implementation so it's slow.  Of course, there's lots of buggy software which is why we have stuff like ASLR / SSP in the first place. :)   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
