This sounds like you're referring to leap seconds, where due to the  Earth's rotation slowing down (as determined by the International Earth  Rotation Service), an extra second is inserted every so often, typically  in July; it's quite fun watching it on a GPS receiver (assuming that it  even survives the event, as I've seen a few cheaper ones lose the plot).  There is a serious proposal to phase out leap seconds (no URL handy right  now), and I have no idea how that will affect time-based security.  --  Dave Horsfall DTM (VK2KFU)  "Bliss is a MacBook with a FreeBSD server." http://www.horsfall.org/spam.html (and check the home page whilst you're there)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
