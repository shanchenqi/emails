The user isn't supposed to believe anything a key says about its own identity. I tried to make it hard for the user to do that.  I was about to reply that signify doesn't even print the fingerprint, but unfortunately I see the option to do that is still there. That was actually supposed to be used for debugging only. That at least is easily removed.  > Maybe a different term instead of “fingerprint” could be used to > reduce the potential for confusion.  Something like “key number” or > “key slot” might be appropriate (because these terms do not confer any > identifying property).  Thanks. I'll think about it for a bit.
