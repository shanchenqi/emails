Correct me if I’m wrong but, for Base64, a value of for len isn’t enough to cause the off-by-one as the while loop will terminate with the value of len being zero (and the value of i being However, if the value of len is either is or the while loop will terminate with the value of len being 1 or 2 respectively (and the value of i being with one of the subsequent if/else if conditions evaluating to true, resulting in the off-by-one. >>  >> I see you’ve checked the template strings used by aws-sdk gem and its dependencies and they use ‘m0’ only, which rules out the possibility this off-by-one being caused by any of these gems.
