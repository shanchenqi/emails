To be clear, I suspect this is exploitable. It would be nice if you could modify the buffer such that gconv will open a path with a string you've appended it (e.g. CHARSET=//. pkexec ./../../../../tmp/foo.so), if not maybe the one byte overflow is still exploitable. You have a reasonable amount of control, e.g. CHARSET=//AAAAA pkexec $(perl -e 'print "A" x  Tavis.
