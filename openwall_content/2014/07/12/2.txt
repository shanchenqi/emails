Bailey Founder / CEO Lab Mouse Security @InfoSecMouse https://www.securitymouse.com/  ############################################################################# # # Lab Mouse Security Report # #  Report ID:  Researcher Name: Don A. Bailey Researcher Organization: Lab Mouse Security Researcher Email: donb@...uritymouse.com Researcher Website: www.securitymouse.com  Vulnerability Status: Reported Vulnerability Embargo: None  Vulnerability Class: Integer Overflow Vulnerability Effect: Memory Corruption Vulnerability Impact: DoS, OOW, RCE Vulnerability DoS Practicality: Practical Vulnerability OOW Practicality: Practical Vulnerability RCE Practicality: Practical Vulnerability Criticality: Critical  Vulnerability Scope: All versions of the Cloudflare golz4 package prior to commit on github. There are no tags or releases for this software package, so master must be used, or a branch past the above commit id.  32bit variants of the package are critically affected. 64bit variants are deemed infeasible to exploit at this time, but still affected by the vulnerability.  Lab Mouse Security has engineered reliable RCE payloads for test applications that use golz4, but a "one-shot" exploit against golz4 is not currently possible due to the memory layout of GoLang.  Criticality Reasoning --------------------- Due to the way GoLang manages objects memory, there are multiple ways to craft a reliable exploit against golz4 that will allow for RCE. It is notable that Don A. Bailey designed his exploit to meet the following conditions:  - bypasses ASLR  - bypasses NX  - portable to any target architecture (tested on 32bit: ARM, x86)  Against applications that the user does not have the source code for, a corresponding memory disclosure vulnerability must be used to accurately craft a malicious RCE payload.  DoS or OOW is always reliable with this exploit.  Vulnerability Description ------------------------- An integer overflow can occur when processing any variant of a "literal run" in the affected function. When certain payloads are processed, a pointer to an output buffer can be set to an address outside of the output buffer. Since the attacker can specify exact offsets in memory, it is very easy to create a reliable RCE exploit.  LZ4_uncompress as well as LZ4_decompress_safe are vulnerable for LZ4 Core releases prior to LZ4_decompress_safe in releases for and later are still vulnerable on 64bit platforms, but considered not feasible or practical to exploit - at this time.  Vulnerability Resolution ------------------------ Resolved.
