The issue was reported for ruby (see the "ruby -v" field).  Backport value was original set to:    UNKNOWN, 2.1: UNKNOWN  which happens to be the default value pre-filed into the field for you by the bug tracker when you try create a new issue.  You can easily check by visiting:  https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/projects/ruby-trunk/issues/new  All changes from UNKNOWN to REQUIRED were not done by the reporter, as you can see from the bug comments.  I don't think you can draw the conclusion based on the Backport field.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
