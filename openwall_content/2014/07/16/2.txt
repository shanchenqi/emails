A statement of "does still allow command injection" would potentially mean two CVE IDs, whereas "may still allow command injection" could end up as "does not still allow command injection."  The original CVE request was on July 9, and implied that watching http://snoopy.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/snoopy/Snoopy/Snoopy.class.php?view=log was of interest because a second security fix might be announced there "shortly." However, that view=log page was last updated on July 8. We will continue to check that view=log page from time to time.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  K+YqSpsexYYJdNBsHcpzMRCHzir4fXLtpdMhJg+rTguaSwitrAC/ezIgDVSmkupj =np9G -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
