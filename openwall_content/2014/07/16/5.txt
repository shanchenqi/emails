This is the original fix for  Note using escapeshellcmd instead of escapeshellarg and still allows injection of params to to curl.  This was then updated to this:  Looking at the changes starting around line (in escapeshellcmd($URI) is replaced with escapeshellarg($URI) however the code handling $cmdline_params is changed to this:  $safer_header = strtr($headers[$curr_header], "\"", " "); $cmdline_params .= " -H \"" . $safer_header . "\""; [..] $cmdline_params .= " -d \"$body\""; exec($this->curl_path . " -k -D \"$headerfile\"" . $cmdline_params . " " . escapeshellarg($URI), $results, $return);  Which by my reading still allows command injection.  Then, starting from revision through this code is all removed and replaced with native php instead of calling curl.  I am not at all involved with this project nor do I have any kind of extra insight on this. Sorry if my original email was misleading or confusing.  Please let me know if there is anything else I can do in order clarify if a CVE assignment is needed for this or not.
