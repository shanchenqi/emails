It also fixes minor theoretically issue to be on the safe side: Dropping uid to user once work has been done but before sending the fd across a UNIX socket.  I dont think that there is a CVE required for any of this (unless someone manages to make an exploit for one of the dependency-libs that were loaded before).  If someone from RH could bring this upstream, it would be very helpful. Last time I tried commiting a fix for ivshmem I just got reverse-blaming.
