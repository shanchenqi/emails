The function "rs_filter_graph" located in file ./librawstudio/rs-filter.c contains the following code:           g_string_append_printf(str, "}\n");          g_file_set_contents("/tmp/rs-filter-graph", str->str, str->len, NULL);           ignore = system("dot -Tpng >/tmp/rs-filter-graph.png </tmp/rs-filter-graph");          ignore = system("gnome-open /tmp/rs-filter-graph.png");  This code makes insecure use of two temporary files:      /tmp/rs-filter-graph.png     /tmp/rs-filter-graph  This allows the truncation of arbitrary files which are owned by the user running rawstudio - for example:      ln -s ~/.important /tmp/rs-filter-graph     ln -s /etc/shadow /tmp/rs-filter-graph.png  Can CVE be assigned to this?
