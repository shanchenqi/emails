No, a restart shuts all connections.  The master process' job is to hold the configured stated and start/stop the worker process.  As part of the startup the socket is opened & bound, but the master does not have anything to do with client sockets.  This is mainly a security decision:  The master must be involatile.  --  Poul-Henning Kamp       | UNIX since Zilog Zeus phk@...eBSD.ORG         | TCP/IP since RFC FreeBSD committer       | BSD since 4.3-tahoe     Never attribute to malice what can adequately be explained by incompetence.
