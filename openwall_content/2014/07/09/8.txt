Surely you agree that this is desirable?  No, I do not.  If DNS is spoofed, then DNS is spoofed and anything which uses DNS is vulnerable, but it is not a security vulnerability in every single piece of software that might conceiveably use DNS lookups, it is a vulnerability in DNS which we have known about since DNS came about.  If the so-called "security industry" wants to be taken seriously, it has to stop this kind of nonsense.  It seems that the primary thing a CVE assignment will cause is for somebody to make another notch in his bedpost.  I also have no idea what "out-of-band patches", nor for that matter which "distros" you are talking about here.  Do you ?  If so I'd like to hear about them, because as I said as the very first thing: We fix bugs in Varnish, and I'd like to receive a copy of those patches.  --  Poul-Henning Kamp       | UNIX since Zilog Zeus phk@...eBSD.ORG         | TCP/IP since RFC FreeBSD committer       | BSD since 4.3-tahoe     Never attribute to malice what can adequately be explained by incompetence.
