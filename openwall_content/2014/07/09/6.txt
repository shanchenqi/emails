Looks like it was until   Andi Kleen: [...]   o Add a guard page at the end of the 47bit address space   o Fix canonical checking for segment registers in ptrace   o check if ptrace RIP is canonical   "Add a guard page at the end of the 47bit address space.  This works around a bug in the AMD K8 CPUs."   "The ptrace call in the Linux kernel and for the AMD64 platform allows local users to cause a denial of service (kernel crash) via a "non-canonical" address."  So apparently the ptrace attack vector was tracked as at the time, whereas TASK_SIZE being equal to the first non-canonical address and triggering "a bug in the AMD K8 CPUs" (the known impact at the time, whatever it was) wasn't tracked as a security issue.  Also related:  "Bug - ptrace: PTRACE_SETREGS does not set RIP"  (some discussion of an earlier fix at ptrace level, NOTABUG by that time).
