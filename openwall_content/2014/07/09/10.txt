I'm sorry, but I'm still relatively new to this list, so forgive me my questioning:  I see lots of "vendor specific" advisories here. So my guess is that "vendor" means "a vendor who bundles software into a linux/bsd/whatever distribution"?  Because I would consider vulnerabilities in php, curl pnp4nagios (just picked as fresh examples) also as "vendor specific", as they are maintained by one vendor/project and those vulnerabilities don't occur in different tools or language implementations.  What I would not consider "vendor specific" are issues inside algorithms or reference implementations of algorithms which are incorporated into different software projects (vendors) like the recent LZ4 and LZO vulns.  Could you clarify this policy maybe a bit?  I find it quite useful to have a dedicated list collecting these reports, and also freebsd ones even if just freebsd is affected.  Lists like full disclosure create way more noise and are thus less useful.  Thanks in advance.  --  Mit freundlichen Grüßen / Regards  Sven Kieske  Systemadministrator Mittwald CM Service GmbH & Co.
