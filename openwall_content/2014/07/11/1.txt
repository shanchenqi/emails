Locale files are not executable code, so even if you imagine a ForceCommand+AcceptEnv configuration *and* have the ability to create a message catalog, don't you still need another bug to exploit this?  However, admittedly there was that zonefile parsing vulnerability and IIRC TZ also permits directory traversal when not setuid. TZ is just as plausibly part of AcceptEnv as LC_ALL, so maybe if it wasn't intentional there's at least a weak argument there for calling it a glibc vulnerability.  Anyway, if we're clearing up old unexploitable glibc bugs, here's another one to consider. LD_PROFILE uses the inherited umask, so you can create root-owned world writable files like this:  $ umask 0 $ LD_PROFILE=libc.so.6 su --version su from util-linux $ ls -l /var/profile -rw-rw-rw-. 1 root taviso 18M Jul 10 libc.so.6.profile  I hadn't reported it as you have to have created /var/profile, and...  $ sudo yum whatprovides /var/profile No matches found  But maybe some other distros have a package (or a bug that lets you create directories), I havn't checked. There are a bunch of ways to abuse this if you have /var/profile.  Tavis.  p.s. I think LD_HWCAP_MASK is still not in unsecure_vars :-)   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
