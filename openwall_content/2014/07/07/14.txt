Cashdollar, @_larry0  Date:  OSVDB:  CVE:Please Assign  Download: http://rubygems.org/gems/VladTheEnterprising  Gem Author:  mlwelles@...il.com  From: ./VladTheEnterprising-0.2/lib/vlad/dba/mysql.rb  The mysql root password can be read out of /tmp/my.cnf.#{target_host} if a local user waits to read that after it is written and before it is removed in line  It is also possible to clobber files owned by the  VladTheEnterprising user process via symlink attack because the my.cnf.#{target_host} doesn't have a randomly created filename.  If this Gem is used in the context of a rails application and the user is allowed to specify the target host command injection can occur at line if special shell meta characters are injected like ; and &.       cnf << "host     = localhost\n"      cnf << "user     = root\n"      cnf << "password = #{mysql_root_password}\n"      File.open("/tmp/my.cnf.#{target_host}", "w") do |file|        file.write(cnf)      end      scp "/tmp/my.cnf.#{target_host}", ".my.cnf"    end    remote_task :remove_dot_my_cnf, :roles => :new_slave do      `rm /tmp/my.cnf.#{target_host}; exit 0`      run "rm -f .my.cnf; exit 0"    end --           :mysql_err => "/var/log/mysql.err",           :my_cnf => lambda { "/etc/mysql/conf.d/#{shortname}.cnf" },           :my_src_cnf => lambda { "files/mysql/configs/#{shortname}.cnf" },           :my_tmp_cnf => lambda { "/tmp/my.cnf-#{version}"},           :my_dest_cnf => lambda { my_cnf },           :mysql_config_nfs_copy => lambda { true },           :mysql_config_copy => lambda {   Advisory: http://www.vapid.dhs.org/advisories/VladTheEnterprising-0.2.html   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
