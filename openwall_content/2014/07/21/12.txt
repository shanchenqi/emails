[...]  LC_*, LANG, LANGUAGE are about setting all the aspect of localisation, not only message catalogs: - character set - character classes (see my other post about bash honouring the   [:blank:] characters as token separators, and [:alpha:] as   valid variable names. - transliteration (toupper/tolower) you can make "foo" match   "bar" case insensitively by making them all map to XXX in   uppercase. - sort orders (so that one can make [A-Z] include / or B sort   before A) - decimal point (so one can have be understood as 1.3 (2   being the decimal point) - month/day names (newline in a month name for the output of ls   -l or date) (as in January is "Jan\n-rw----- 1...") - ... - not to mention the fact that the whole localisation code is   quite complex and I wouldn't be surprised if it crashed   miserabily on unexpected/incorrect locale data  Note that it's not about the ability to create message catalogs but about the ability to upload files with arbitrary names.

[...]  the main problem here I'd say is that those variables are honoured *by default* by most of a Unix tool chest, and the shell to start with (see my other email in this thread about bash), so even "ForceCommand LC_ALL=C some/command" won't fix everything.  --  Stephane   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
