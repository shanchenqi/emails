It would have been useful for your new CVE request to have included a pointer back to the earlier discussion here about exactly the same bugzilla.novell.com bug number.  We understand that a patch now exists (one did not exist at the time of the previous discussion).  We also understand that org.kde.fontinst.service and org.kde.kcontrol.kcmclock.service have been mentioned as examples of services that can be attacked on systems without the patch.   Can you confirm that you are asking for a CVE ID for the KAuth product, not the "PolicyKit Library Qt Bindings" product?  Should there also be a separate CVE ID for       "The deprecated polkit method in polkit-qt5 bindings has been    updated to polkit_unix_process_new_for_owner."  ?  Should there also be a separate CVE ID for       "Qt, since 5.3, aborts action if the Q*Application is SUID."  ?  (This may be a largely unrelated issue, but perhaps "Qt before 5.3 proceeds with an action even if the Q*Application is SUID" is an implied vulnerability report.)  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =ZJrr -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
