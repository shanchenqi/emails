I checked kernel and runtime-tested on a  While maybe_add_creds() (via SOCK_PASSCRED) and scm_send() (via unix_{stream,dgram}_sendmsg()) use the real UID,  cred_to_ucred() (via SO_PEERCRED) passes the EUID (this time also kuid_munged()).  That should probably being consolidated and in particular its unclear to me why one time you need kuid munging and onother time you dont.
