The Ansible platform suffers from input sanitization errors that allow arbitrary code execution as well as information leak, in case an attacker is able to control certain playbook variables.  The first vulnerability involves the escalation of a local permission access level into arbitrary code execution. The code execution can be triggered by interpolation of file names maliciously crafted as lookup plugin commands, in combination with its pipe feature.  The second vulnerability concerns the unsafe parsing of action arguments in the face of an attacker controlling variable data (whether fact data, with_fileglob data, or other sources), allowing an attacker to supply their own options to an action. The impact of this is dependent on the action module the attacker targets. For example, an attacker controlling variables passed to the copy or template actions would be able to trigger arbitrary code execution (in addition to simple information leakage) via the validate option's acceptance of arbitrary shell code.
