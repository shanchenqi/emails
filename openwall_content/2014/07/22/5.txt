There should also be a discrepancy regarding when the credentials are  captured (time of send for SOCK_PASSCRED, time of socket creation for  SO_PEERCRED).  The latter is required because privileged processes  assume that they can safely write to stderr, so picking the current  process credentials may well introduce vulnerabilities.  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
