These are the differences I noticed when comparing the related code in Ruby (where his sample worked normally) with Ruby 2.0 and 2.1, but are not related to the (off-by-one) initially discussed, as it may be the case the reporter may be referring to a different issue, since Tomas analysis of aws-sdk gem and its dependencies indicates it's unlikely this issue is being caused by any of these gems.  >  > (We realize that is of interest because it is the "Old stable" > distribution advertised on the > https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ page.) >  > Is one of these scenarios the correct interpretation? >  >   1.

Weâre still not sure about the presence of a different issue affecting Ruby 2.0 and 2.1. I left a comment on the report pointing out that is also affected by the off-by-one and suggesting confirming with the reporter if he continues to observe the crash after adding the fix.  >  > -- > CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority > M/S > Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA > [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] >  -- Ramon de C Valle VMware Product Security Engineering   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
