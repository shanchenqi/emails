It has been patched for some time now. In the interest of full disclosure, I'm providing the same details to this list.  Email address of requester: security@...thon.org; rgbkrk@...il.com Software name: IPython notebook Type of vulnerability: Cross domain websocket hijacking Attack outcome: Remote execution Patch/issue: Changelog: http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/whatsnew/github-stats-2.0.html Affected versions: â¤ version < 1.2  Summary: The origin of websocket requests was not verified within the IPython notebook server. If an attacker has knowledge of an IPython kernel id they can run arbitrary code on a user's machine when the client visits a crafted malicious page.  Post on our own mailing list: Note: truncated CVE was posted to the mailing list, corrected after (my bad).
