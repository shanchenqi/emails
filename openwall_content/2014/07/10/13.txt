Perhaps the documentation of AcceptEnv needs to be revised to mention this exception.  > which is sort of unavoidable.  Actually, it is avoidable.  Yes, there is:  	if (s->term) 		child_set_env(&env, &envsize, "TERM", s->term);  but there's also:  static int session_pty_req(Session *s) { [...] 	if (no_pty_flag || !options.permit_tty) { 		debug("Allocating a pty not permitted for this authentication."); 		return 0; 	} [...] 	s->term = packet_get_string(&len);  So it looks like listing "no-pty" in authorized_keys prevents not only allocation of a pty, but also passing of TERM.  And this makes sense.  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
