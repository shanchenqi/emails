Probably, especially if there is a checkout of the repository in the file system under a predictable path.  (I expect that most hosted repositories use the bare format.)  I don't know how common this is with the existing Git hosting frameworks.  Some of them don't use OpenSSH and may not implement environment variable processing at all.  > Or are these usually setup to filter the environment?  It seems fairly likely because unexpected, but benign locale settings would interfere with the hook script processing (which likely assume U.S. date formats and UTF-8).
