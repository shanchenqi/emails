Together with typical OpenSSH configurations (with suitable AcceptEnv settings in sshd_config), this could conceivably be used to bypass ForceCommand restrictions (or restricted shells), assuming the attacker has sufficient level of access to a file system location on the host to create crafted locale definitions there.
