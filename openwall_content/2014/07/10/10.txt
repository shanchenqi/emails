The man page for sshd_config(5) says this about AcceptEnv:  "The default is not to accept any environment variables."  The default sshd_config found in does not list AcceptEnv, so presumably by default OpenSSH portable does not accept any environment variables.  However, apparently some distros override this safe default:   | Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala  EDT  |  | The sshd_config file by default contain the following AcceptEnv directives. |  | AcceptEnv LANG LC_CTYPE LC_NUMERIC LC_TIME LC_COLLATE LC_MONETARY LC_MESSAGES | AcceptEnv LC_PAPER LC_NAME LC_ADDRESS LC_TELEPHONE LC_MEASUREMENT | AcceptEnv LC_IDENTIFICATION LC_ALL LANGUAGE | AcceptEnv XMODIFIERS  Is there a supported way for distros to configure OpenSSH such that a number of environment variables would be accepted by default, but only as long as no command is forced?  This could be an acceptable tradeoff.  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
