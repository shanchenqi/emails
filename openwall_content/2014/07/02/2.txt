Use for the fix that was announced in the ansible-announce "Ansible update - security release" message at  exists because of an incomplete fix for  Additional CVE IDs (at least two) will be assigned for:  A. The ansible-announce "Ansible - updated security fix" message at  B. The ansible-announce "Ansible - refinements to previous security fixes" message at  (At least for item B, there may have been distinct problems reported by distinct discoverers, and per-discoverer CVE assignments may be best if that information is available. It seems likely that that information won't be available at the time when the CVEs are needed -- and probably individual independent researchers won't be publishing separate advisories about subsets of the safe_eval problem -- so one CVE ID for A and one CVE ID for B is a realistic outcome.)  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =OI7a -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
