A malicious process could force system services or user applications to be disconnected from the D-Bus system bus by sending them a message containing a file descriptor, then causing that file descriptor to exceed the kernel's maximum recursion depth (itself introduced to fix a DoS) before dbus-daemon forwards the message to the victim process. Most services and applications exit when disconnected from the system bus, leading to a denial of service. This is tracked as and  Additionally, Alban discovered that bug a bug previously reported by Alejandro Martínez Suárez which was not believed to be a security flaw, could be used for a similar denial of service, by causing dbus-daemon to attempt to forward invalid file descriptors to a victim process when file descriptors become associated with the wrong message. Its security implications are tracked as and  For the 1.8.x stable branch, these vulnerabilities are fixed in version For the 1.6.x old-stable branch, these vulnerabilities are fixed in version  All earlier versions of dbus with the file descriptor passing feature and up) are believed to be vulnerable. Distributions that backport security fixes should backport git commits and attached.
