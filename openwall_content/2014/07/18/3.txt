It was fixed in bozohttpd version Quoting NetBSD advisory:  > Abstract > ======== >  > When checking for restricted access via .htpasswd files, bozohttpd > fails to properly check for truncation, allowing specially crafted > requests to bypass access control without a password.  Files of > length 10 or more are not affected. >  >  > Technical Details > ================= >  > A call to snprintf() was not properly checking for truncation of > a provided user path, allowing a later concatenation of the > ".htpasswd" file name to exceed the maximum pathname length.  This > stops the check for .htpasswd file from working correctly, bypassing > the basic HTTP authentication scheme.  Files with names longer than > ".htpasswd" are not visible as they require at least enough for a > valid path to be available.
