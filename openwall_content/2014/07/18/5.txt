There are a few different groups who are potentially able to assign CVE IDs for issues in, say, LibreSSL. On rare occasions, the different groups don't have the same expectations about coordinating.  At MITRE, we (obviously) know where came from, and we'll send information here about the resolution as soon as it happens.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =ECnJ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
