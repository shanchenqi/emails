I looked for cases where pickle.loads is used on untrusted data, the good news is didn't find many, the main two uses cases were taking data from zeroMQ and memcached and then unpickling it, looks like those would be compromised in any event if malicious data got in there, let alone RCE type stuff.  However having said that we do have this one in the past:  Object Storage (swift) before uses the loads function in the pickle Python module unsafely when storing and loading metadata in memcached, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted pickle object.  So here is my question, is all pickle.loads from things like memcached (which has no auth) generally CVE worthy? If so I can post a list of the potentials, I'll be honest, I'm to lazy to go digging through it (I'm not sure how many uses shared/public memcached configs/etc.).  - --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1 Comment: Using GnuPG with Thunderbird - http://www.enigmail.net/  BlVoPs+Cn2TjDth7uVsZ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
