There can realistically be usernames and passwords in /var/log/messages, at least when that log file is used by poorly written site-specific software. Thus, a CVE can be assigned.  A CVE could also be assigned if there wasn't a mode local file, but the archive containing /var/log/messages was transmitted externally in a "technical-support data stream" (as in  Incidentally, some vendors assign a CVE ID if one of their products logs a password to a file that has default permissions of even if the vendor's documentation says that the customer must not change the permissions. Their rationale is that the password logging was a security-relevant implementation error. At some point, it comes down to the vendor understanding its own customers. If they know that customers ignore the documentation and use instead, this would be a reasonable motivation for declaring the coding error to be security-relevant.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =9uMS -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
