On the other hand,  I just discovered another XSS vulnerability that is not solved by the current patch.  Here you have the details to reproduce it:  Create a new user or edit an existing one with the following Full Name: [XSS] Then go to System Utilities - View User Log, and if the user has logged in you will see a popup with the text "XSS".  Maybe the can by used to identify this last discovery.
