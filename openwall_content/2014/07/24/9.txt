Yes, this is what we will do. was not previously bound to any conflicting public vulnerability information, so we will establish the public scope of as exclusively this new "System Utilities - View User Log" XSS issue. Our understanding is that this crosses privilege boundaries because the attacker must have "User Administration" enabled under "Realm Permissions" but the attacker does not need to have all of the Realm Permissions. If this is incorrect and "User Administration" is always equivalent to the "admin" user at all Cacti sites, then this CVE wouldn't be needed.  In any case, still defines the meaning of and  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =mGH4 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
