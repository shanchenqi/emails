Here are some distro vendor status pages on this bug:  Enforce RIP <= TASK_SIZE_MAX  Ubuntu has just sent out 7 update announcements (for different of their supported distros/kernels), through  "ptrace,x86: force IRET path after a ptrace_stop()"  Kernel: Enforce RIP <= TASK_SIZE_MAX"  Red Hat's statement is:  "This issue affects the versions of the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, 7 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2. Future kernel updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, 7 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 may address this issue."  but it appears to have been posted before my unsuccessful attempts to trigger the error condition on RHEL5'ish and RHEL6'ish kernels yesterday. I fully agree that we need to treat these kernels as likely vulnerable unless we can show otherwise, though - obviously, simply not being able to trigger the problem with a particular PoC doesn't mean much.  So far, we're aware that the problem is definitely triggerable on recent kernels (at least mainline and recent Ubuntu) running on Intel CPUs (including in guest kernels in some VMs that run on Intel CPU hosts).  Other closely related issues are (Linux kernel SYSRET vulnerability) and (Xen/FreeBSD/NetBSD/Windows SYSRET vulnerability).  What we have here may be viewed as an incomplete fix for or a regression of depending on whether all kernels since (the first version to have a fix for are vulnerable or some are not vulnerable (this is currently unclear).  Due to the similarity with we probably could also state that the issue does not affect systems running on AMD CPUs, as that was the conclusion for when it was discussed two years ago. However, the fix for (fixed in added this comment:   * When user can change the frames always force IRET. That is because  * it deals with uncanonical addresses better. SYSRET has trouble  * with them due to bugs in both AMD and Intel CPUs.  so maybe there were in fact relevant bugs in early AMD CPUs (and this aspect was overlooked when was discovered and discussed?)   As far as I understand, for CPUs behaving as documented, the relevant difference between AMD and Intel is in whether SYSRET triggers #GP before (Intel) or after (AMD) switching to user mode.  Here's its description from Intel, including pseudocode showing the problematic behavior:  http://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/SYSRET.html  "IF (CPL != 0) OR (RCX is not canonical) THEN #GP(0); FI;" is found close to the beginning of the SYSRET pseudocode.  In my testing yesterday, I was in fact able to trigger the problem using Andy's PoC on Ubuntu on Intel but not on another Ubuntu install on AMD  This is as expected.
