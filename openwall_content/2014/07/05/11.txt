No, I was just clarifying for others.  You do actually have all kernels listed as vulnerable here:   > It was just that we didn't managed to make them crash on the > few boxes we tried on.  I think the "Kernel panic - not syncing: Machine halted" is actually unexpected.  The PoC isn't meant to crash the machine, although as we've seen it might.  It's meant to test whether the issue is triggerable, and if it is we should assume that a real exploit may do more (including both DoS and privilege escalation).
