Description:  A Page Flip Book Plugin for WordPress contains a flaw that may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands or code. This issue is triggered when input passed to the wp-content/plugins/wppageflip/pageflipbook.php script from index.php is not properly sanitizing user input, specifically directory traversal style attacks (e.g., ../../) supplied to the 'pageflipbook_language' parameter. This may allow an attacker to include a file from the targeted host that contains arbitrary commands or code that will be executed by the vulnerable script. Such attacks are limited due to the script only calling files already on the target host. In addition, this flaw can potentially be used to disclose the contents of any file on the system accessible by the web server.  Plugin page: http://wordpress.org/plugins/wppageflip/ Discussion: http://wordpress.org/support/topic/pageflipbook-pageflipbook_language-parameter-local-file-inclusion Related:  I was unable to reproduce this vulnerability in version 3.0 of this plugin so fixed in the latest version at least. Other versions not tested.  --- Henri Salo  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
