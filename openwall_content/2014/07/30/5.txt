As reported by Tobias Stoeckmann: In function get_option, the DHO_OPTIONSOVERLOADED option checks if there are overloaded options, like bootfile or servername.  It tries to make sure that it's called only once, BUT overwrites that information after receiving a DHO_END.  A malicious server could set the option DHO_OPTIONSOVERLOADED yet another time in the bootfile or servername section, which will result in another jump -- maybe into the same area.  This has been fixed upstream here:  I would like to request a CVE for the issue.  has been released with the above fix.  Thanks  Roy  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.  Confused about mailing lists and their use?
