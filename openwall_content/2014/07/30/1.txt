There has been several cases where ElasticSearch has been used in server compromise. This is the vulnerability what they are using. I have also seen this hitting honeypots.  ElasticSearch contains a flaw that is triggered as input passed via the 'source' parameter to /_search is not properly sanitized. This allows a remote attacker to manipulate files and execute arbitrary commands.
