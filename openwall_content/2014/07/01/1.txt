Clients using the library could however set ciphers via  an option, but as it would work without, they might not have.   This was fixed in curl  Daniel Stenberg (12 Jan - OpenSSL: deselect weak ciphers by default      By default even recent versions of OpenSSL support and accept both   "export strength" ciphers, small-bitsize ciphers as well as downright   deprecated ones.      This change sets a default cipher set that avoids the worst ciphers, and   subsequently makes https://www.howsmyssl.com/a/check no longer grade   curl/OpenSSL connects as 'Bad'.
