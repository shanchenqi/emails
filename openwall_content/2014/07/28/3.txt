Files: add_headers.php, minify.php >  > Affected: 1.0 > Fixed in: 1.1 >  > Changelog: http://wordpress.org/plugins/vitamin/changelog/ > SCM:  Use The scope of this CVE ID is the directory traversal. It isn't directly about the ability to access .php and .phtml files in unpatched versions, apparently corrected with lines such as:    if( 'php' == strtolower($ext) ) { die("Adding headers to php files is forbidden"); }  We did not research that in depth, but suspect that it may be a usability fix rather than a security fix.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =cnlx -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
