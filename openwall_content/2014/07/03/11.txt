And I don't get the argument from poul-henning kamp, what I understand is: "hey, we trust our backend server" well, but your backend server can make you crash, so you probably shouldn't trust it in the first place?  you _never_ can trust input, so you have to validate it, either way, at least enough to not crash or perform malicious actions.
