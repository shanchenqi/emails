As long as varnish has no high priority to protect itself against malicious backends I'd say it is not suited to be a frontend proxy in a CDN network (you could use a seperate varnish instance for each application/"trust group" though).  Different implementations have different priorities; choose one that matches your requirements.  regards, Stefan  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
