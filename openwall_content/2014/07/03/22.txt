No because there is no trust boundary violation. If the root user is logged in at a terminal executing command as root, that's fine. If a non root user who is not authorized (e.g. via sudo or a setuid program) is logged in and executing stuff as root, that's a trust boundary violation.  In this case it's pretty simple: the back end web servers are NOT supposed to be able to shut down the varnish cache server (if this was supposed to happen you'd have built a proper channel to do so). That they can do so means it is a denial of service, and therefore a trust boundary violation. Ergo it needs a CVE.  > regards, Stefan   - --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1 Comment: Using GnuPG with Thunderbird - http://www.enigmail.net/  =qhco -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
