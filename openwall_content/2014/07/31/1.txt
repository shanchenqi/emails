We've since learned that nobody ever assigned to that LibreSSL issue, and apparently every appearance of in "a number of web pages" was ultimately the result of a miscommunication outside of MITRE.  A complication is that had been assigned to a different issue, and that issue isn't yet public. What you should do is:    - if you're part of the embargo audience that has been using     for a private vulnerability, use     instead    - if you're not part of that embargo audience, all we can suggest is     that it's very likely that you'll see a public disclosure of     in the future  Also:    - MITRE is not part of the embargo audience and does not know what     the vulnerability is    - MITRE has separately communicated the CVE ID change to the     organization that originally assigned  Soon, the MITRE CVE web site will have this for    ** REJECT **    DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER.

This unrelated topic is a LibreSSL code change adding   functionality for certain process-bifurcation use cases that might   arise in future LibreSSL-based applications.  There is no CVE ID   associated with this LibreSSL code change.
