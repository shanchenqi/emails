On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 an unprivileged local user could use this flaw to cause OOM conditions leading to denial of service or, potentially, trigger use-after-free error.  On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 a privileged local user with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (also in a container) could use this flaw to cause OOM conditions leading to denial of service or, potentially, trigger use-after-free error.  Acknowledgements: Red Hat would like to thank Vasily Averin of Parallels for reporting this issue. "  Problem was fixed in OpenVZ kernel  Also I would like to add that KernelCare project (http://kernelcare.com) have released a live hot update for this issue, both for affected OpenVZ and RHEL6 kernels.
