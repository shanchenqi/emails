We usually go through someone else for CVEs, and he directed us this time to contact this address. We’ll be more careful in the future.

If you want a CVE ID for an   undisclosed vulnerability in the future -- for example, because you   want to include the CVE ID number when the   https://www.reviewboard.org/news/ entry first becomes public -- there   are other options, such as sending the CVE request directly to   cve-assign@...re.org instead.)    - --   CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority   M/S   Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA   [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ]   -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----   Version: GnuPG (SunOS)                =STIj   -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----     Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
