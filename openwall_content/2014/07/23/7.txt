The  upstream Subversion commit is here:     These changes will be part of the next version of GCC (whose version  number is still to be decided).  I think this warrants a CVE assignment.  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
