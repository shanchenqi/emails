The reason rpcbind qualifies for a CVE is it exposes rpcbind on interfaces against the direct configuration it was given (e.g. if you tell it to listen to localhost only it would expose itself to the world).  - --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1 Comment: Using GnuPG with Thunderbird - http://www.enigmail.net/  =He5z -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
