Corrected:      UTC (stable/10,                 UTC                 UTC (stable/9, 9.3-PRERELEASE)                 UTC (releng/9.3,                 UTC (releng/9.3,                 UTC (releng/9.3,                 UTC (releng/9.3,                 UTC (releng/9.2,                 UTC (releng/9.1,                 UTC (stable/8, 8.4-STABLE)                 UTC (releng/8.4, CVE Name:        For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the following sections, please visit <URL:http://security.FreeBSD.org/>.  I.   Background  The control message API is used to construct ancillary data objects for use in control messages sent and received across sockets and passed via the recvmsg(2) and sendmsg(2) system calls.  II.  Problem Description  Buffer between control message header and data may not be completely initialized before being copied to userland.  Three SCTP cmsgs, SCTP_SNDRCV, SCTP_EXTRCV and SCTP_RCVINFO, have implicit padding that may not be completely initialized before being copied to userland.  In addition, three SCTP notifications, SCTP_PEER_ADDR_CHANGE, SCTP_REMOTE_ERROR and SCTP_AUTHENTICATION_EVENT, have padding in the returning data structure that may not be completely initialized before being copied to userland.   III. Impact  An unprivileged local process may be able to retrieve portion of kernel memory.  For the generic control message, the process may be able to retrieve a maximum of 4 bytes of kernel memory.  For SCTP, the process may be able to retrieve 2 bytes of kernel memory for all three control messages, plus 92 bytes for SCTP_SNDRCV and 76 bytes for SCTP_EXTRCV.  If the local process is permitted to receive SCTP notification, a maximum of bytes of kernel memory may be returned to userland.  This information might be directly useful, or it might be leveraged to obtain elevated privileges in some way.  For example, a terminal buffer might include a user-entered password.  IV.  Workaround  No workaround is available.  V.   Solution  Perform one of the following:  1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.  2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:  The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable FreeBSD release branches.  a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.  [FreeBSD # fetch # fetch # gpg --verify kmem.patch.asc  [FreeBSD 8.4, 9.2 and 9.3-RC] # fetch # fetch # gpg --verify kmem.patch.asc  [FreeBSD 9.1] # fetch # fetch # gpg --verify kmem.patch.asc  b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:  # cd /usr/src # patch < /path/to/patch  c) Recompile your kernel as described in <URL:http://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/kernelconfig.html> and reboot the system.  3) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:  Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the or amd64 platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:  # freebsd-update fetch # freebsd-update install  VI.  Correction details  The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each affected branch.
