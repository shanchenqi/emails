Red Hat's statement has since been edited to:  "This issue does not affect the versions of the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  Future kernel updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 will address this issue."  I was subscribed to this Bugzilla entry, yet I didn't receive an e-mail notification when this edit was made.  I guess Bugzilla does not send those for edits to past comments.  While I think I understand why Red Hat does it this way, and it's fine, maybe a better practice would be to also add new comments like "I've just edited our statement in comment #4 above because ..." - that way, some revision history will be preserved, rationale for the change given, and e-mail notifications will be sent.  Anyway, let me ask: Red Hat, how do you know RHEL5 kernels are not vulnerable, whereas RHEL6 are?  There must have been some analysis to arrive at these conclusions.  This will be very helpful to know for downstream projects (as it relates to your kernels), including OpenVZ and Owl.  Since we're past the weekend and since some distros have already released security updates, I think it's OK to start talking about specific code paths triggering the problem publicly.  In fact, I think it's best to make this info public before the next weekend approaches.  Meanwhile, I've attached the patch for that we're using on Owl (lacking convincing rationale, let alone proof, why those kernels are not vulnerable).
