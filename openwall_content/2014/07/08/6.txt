A malicious Orchestration template owner or catalog may conduct an XSS attack once a corrupted template is used in the Orchestration/Stack section of Horizon. A malicious Horizon user may store an XSS attack by creating a network with a corrupted name. A malicious Horizon administrator may store an XSS attack by creating a user with a corrupted email address. Once executed in a legitimate context these attacks may result in potential asset stealing (horizon user/admin access credentials, VMs/Network configuration/management, tenants' confidential information, etc.). All Horizon setups are affected.  Juno (development branch) fix:  Icehouse fix:  Havana fix:  Notes: This fix will be included in the Juno-2 development milestone and in future and releases.
