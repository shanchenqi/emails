What are your current affiliations (e.g., any Linux distro)?  Sure. Send me instructions and I'm happy to help. I'm helping in Debian teams as non Debian Developer status (I do not see embargoed issues) mainly committing to security tracker[1][2] and in forensics team[3]. My current employer has nothing to do with distro maintanance or similar activities (we only submit and patch issues publicly in case it affects our projects). I usually follow oss-security closely in my spare time so that I can submit bugs to Debian issue tracker[4].  1: https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ 2: 3: http://forensics.alioth.debian.org/ 4: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?archive=both;submitter=henri%40nerv.fi  --- Henri Salo  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
