PV frontend rings have an endpoint in the guest, but by contrast the xenaccess ring is supposed to have its endpoint in Xen, having a guest able to poke at it therefore requires additional consideration and thought.  > Is this predicated on the potential (lack of) software quality of the > xenaccess backends? That's a fair argument, but a different story.  An attacker who can poke at this particular ring can cause the xenaccess backend's view of the world to become different from the actual state of things within Xen, by virtue of injecting events for which Xen has not made the appropriate state change.  For instance imagine a xenaccess who was trying to enforce W^X but was being fed false information by the guest about writing/executing pages which did not correspond to actual changes being made in the p2m.  For qemu there is no Xen side state, so all a guest can do with ring access here is to perform emulated I/O which it could otherwise have achieved by doing the I/O.  Ian.
