My concern was more about things that are outside your control and can still cause set*id calls to fail even if you feed them with sane data. Some of these include other errors that can be encountered inside syscall (e.g. memory allocation issues), capability issues, or simply having MAC system (think SELinux) policy denying id change.  Those were mentioned here:   Of course, while none of these are known to offer such easily and widely usable attack vector as RLIMIT_NPROC causing setuid failure, it seems reasonable to fix all properly while at it.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
