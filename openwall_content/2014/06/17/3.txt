Josh, I do recall you wanted to resign as a co-moderator a while ago, and it makes sense for us to have a new co-moderator from neither Openwall nor Red Hat, and preferably not from a for-profit Linux company.  For example, someone from Debian or a *BSD could be OK, or some active oss-security contributor who is not with any distro.  IIRC, a long while ago Henri Salo expressed an interest (in private e-mail to me) in contributing to this sort of activities.  Henri, would you like to help co-moderate oss-security - which currently means only approving obviously-desirable messages, and leaving everything else to me?  What are your current affiliations (e.g., any Linux distro)?  On Sun, Jun 08, at rea wrote: > I have no stake in the game. If you need a hand just let me know.  Thanks rea, but as far as I can tell this is the very first time you posted to oss-security.  While the task of approving obviously-desirable messages quickly is simple enough that I think you'd manage well, I think it's better for us to choose a co-moderator who has been actively contributing to discussions on oss-security.  I've also received an offer off-list from someone who is with a for-profit Linux-related company.  While I appreciate the offer greatly, I think it's preferable for our new co-moderator to have no such affiliation.  I'm confident this doesn't actually matter for how the messages are processed (as long as I'm involved and I see the lack of abusive delays), but I guess it might matter for the confidence of others who don't have this sort of direct visibility into how message moderation is done.
