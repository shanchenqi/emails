Hi Ben,  we usually don't assign CVE from our pool for public issues, and I'm especially reluctant here as I don't know if someone else aware of this issue could have assign one.  So I'm asking on oss-sec to assign one so it gets some publicity for security people and someone has a chance to yell if a CVE has already been assigned.  oss-sec / MITRE: it seems that SECCOMP on MIPS doesn't behave properly (see [1] for all the details). I'm unsure when it started (I guess when seccomp was first added to MIPS, it seems at least 3.2 is affected), and it's fixed in (with  Can someone assign a CVE is this is indeed a new issue?
