In order to ensure full traceability, we need a CVE number assigned that we can attach to further notifications. This issue is already public, although an advisory was not sent yet.  Title: Neutron L3-agent DoS through IPv6 subnet Reporter: Thiago Martins (HP) Products: Neutron Versions: up to and  Description: Thiago Martins from Hewlett Packard reported a vulnerability in Neutron L3-agent. By creating an IPv6 private subnet attached to a L3 router, an authenticated user may break the L3-agent, preventing further floating IPv4 addresses from being attached for the entire cloud. Note: removal of the faulty network can not be done using the API and must be cleaned at the database level. Only Neutron setups using IPv6 and L3-agent are affected.
