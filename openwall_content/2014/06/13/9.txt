In general, there might be arguments in favor of either 0, 1, or 2 CVEs for this.  >  The PVE/API2/AccessControl.pm change mentions both:    to prevent user enumeration attacks    to prevent timing attacks  but these don't seem to be independently relevant. The issue is that an attacker could determine that they have discovered a valid username because either:    the error message changes (i.e.,    or    the response occurs more slowly (i.e.,  It seems that there would be hardly any point in fixing the issue unless the issue were also fixed. That may be an argument for combining the two into a single CVE.  The more controversial question is whether this type of a instance should continue to have a CVE ID in all future cases. mentions "Avoid inconsistent messaging that might accidentally tip off an attacker about internal state, such as whether a username is valid or not." However, some authors outside MITRE have recently made an apparently opposite assertion, e.g., "It is time to accept that account existence is something an attacker can easily learn, and gain the usability benefits of telling real people that they've misspelled their account identifier." ("Threat Modeling: Designing for Security," ISBN page  In this case, the commit message of "prevent user enumeration attacks" might be considered close enough to a vendor statement that "the Proxmox security policy is that authentication components must have countermeasures, and lack of these countermeasures was an implementation error."  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =WyiO -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
