Default configuration is: 2 threads / max-mthreads, which leads to a theoretical FD consumption of Default FD limit on many distributions is This can potentially lead to the DoS attack.  Workaround (from [1]):  - Reduce max-mthreads to (or threads to 1 and max-mthreads to (max-mthreads was introduced in Recursor 3.2; but if you are running a version that old, please upgrade it!) - Run ‘ulimit -n before starting (perhaps put this in /etc/init.d/ script). There’s little reason to skip on this number. - Investigate defaults in /etc/security/limits.conf  Patch is available at [2]  [1]: [2]:  References:   Can a CVE please be assigned if one has not been already?
