Thanks for the investigation.

Good point, my searches indeed usually don't include any non-C implementation, which might or might not be affected. >  > Syslinux does not use LZO on arbitrary data.  Thanks, so that's three reasons syslinux itself is not affected:  - embedded LZO didn't contain the affected code; - syslinux core LZO assembly implementation is not touched; - LZO is done only on controlled data (not under anyone control?)
