Cherokee should be expecting the semantics:    - If I send a username and a non-empty password, a successful bind means     that that's the correct password for the user    - If I send a username and an empty password, a successful bind means     that (A) that's not the correct password for the user and (B)     the LDAP server probably happens to allow unauthenticated information     retrieval that might or might not be intentional  Instead, Cherokee incorrectly assumes that the semantics are:    - If I send a username and any password (empty or non-empty), a     successful bind means that that's the correct password for the user  Use  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =ukMd -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
