It's unclear how to answer except by saying: a decision to use or not use the HttpOnly flag isn't a system-integration issue.  You then mentioned 'if setting this flag "fixes" all XSS issues.' It seems that a reasonable response here is: an XSS attack can have a severe impact even if it's not designed to steal any cookies. (The non-cookie-stealing severity varies, in part, based on the types of input that are common for the web application in question.) The HttpOnly flag is specific to cookies.  Finally, you mentioned "They can't _both_ get CVEs" - a question that seems to be about a superfluous CVE assignment in a case where the only goal of an XSS attack is to steal a cookie, and the attack relies on an XSS vulnerability in a certain web application that doesn't set the HttpOnly flag. A response here is: there could be a scenario that ended up with a single CVE assignment for a composite of one specific instance of incorrect input validation and an incorrect cookie restriction. This scenario seems rare. It would require that neither issue was dangerous except in the presence of the other issue. For example, it would require that the only possible impact of the incorrect input validation was to pass JavaScript code that could steal cookies (any other malicious JavaScript code would be blocked). In most practical cases, two CVE assignments would often be possible if someone happened to request two.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJTrjRBAAoJEKllVAevmvms2HsH/2VBdQVvAbOZKDgsjGVpiiJv =LDPf -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
