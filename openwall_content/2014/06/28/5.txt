Actually my point was more that back in the day cookie theft was relatively rare, now it is pretty common thanks largely to XSS:  http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=xss  so in my opinion we should assume most web based apps have XSS vulns (I think that's a safe assumption =), as such then the use of HTTPOnly on cookies becomes a virtual necessity to protect cookies as opposed to a "nice to have hardening feature". In other words the security bar should be moved (at least that's my opinion).   - --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1 Comment: Using GnuPG with Thunderbird - http://www.enigmail.net/  =qNmV -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
