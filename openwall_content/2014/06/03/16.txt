Ok, that makes sense.  Of course it is pointless for security if it doesn't affect parameter entities.  I also find it odd that one of the only standard methods available to directly tweak entity behavior can only be implemented by setting a feature in Xerces that is non-standard.   > Maybe your paper should rather mention parser features as > external-general-entities and external-parameter-entities: >  > http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/org/xml/sax/package-summary.html#package_description  I do mention the specific features that one needs to disable in order to make parsing safe.  However, I didn't realize that that some of these features were standardized.  Still, it would be quite confusing to any developer that doesn't spend extensive amounts of time researching each XML feature and understanding what needs to be turned off.   > OWASP XXE document covers some of this, but actually mentions only one > of the two features... >  > https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Processing#Java  I did end up releasing my paper recently, which I believe has up-to-date recommendations for Xerces:   http://vsecurity.com/download/papers/XMLDTDEntityAttacks.pdf   Best, tim  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
