I am part of the PSIRT team where I help manage the receipt, investigation and internal coordination of security vulnerability information related to IBM offerings. You can read more about PSIRT here: http://www-03.ibm.com/security/secure-engineering/process.html.  I am the main coordinator of Open Source vulnerabilities that affect IBM products. We have products that utilize Open Source software, so being part of this list will be beneficial. I do not plan on posting any IBM product specific issues as we do that through Security Bulletins (see http://www-03.ibm.com/security/secure-engineering/bulletins.html).  You can verify that I am part of the PSIRT team by emailing PSIRT directly at IBM PSIRT<slash>Somers<slash>IBM or psirt<at>us<dot>ibm<dot>com.  Here is my Personal PGP key: (See attached file: Lisa Bradley_PublicKey.asc)  Thanks for your consideration, Lisa  Lisa Marie Wood Bradley, PhD Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT), SWG Master Inventor lbradley<at>us<dot>ibm<dot>com Content of type "text/html" skipped  Download attachment "Lisa Bradley_PublicKey.asc" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
