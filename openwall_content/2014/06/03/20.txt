See:     We had planned to proceed with this viewpoint:    1. If Red Hat shipped Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 2 with a publicly      known password in broker.conf, Red Hat is allowed to categorize      that as a vulnerability and assign a CVE ID.    2. There was also an issue in an example script. The script in      question had comments of "not comprehensive nor robust enough ...      require significant adaptations ... Please adapt it."      Nonetheless, this is a script authored by Red Hat, and Red Hat      might have been treating it as a supported part of a software      product. If so, then Red Hat is allowed to categorize a script      issue as a vulnerability and assign a CVE ID. Unless Red Hat      chooses to take that position, the default decision for that type      of disclaimed example code is that a CVE ID assignment isn't made.    3. The CVE IDs in 1 and 2 can't be the same.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =2HvF -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
