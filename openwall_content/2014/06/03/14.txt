After some time after reporting it to bash developers, it has not been fixed.  We think that this is a security issue because in some circumstances the bash security feature could be bypassed allowing the bash to be a valid target shell in an attack.  We strongly recommend to patch your bash code.  Why don't fix this bug by simple adding mandatory "if" clause ? Any comments about this issue are welcomed.
