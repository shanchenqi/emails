I finally found time  to do some testing on OpenJDK I can confirm Tomas' assessment  that setExpandEntityReferences() and  setFeature(XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING, true) have no bearing  on whether or not entity references are expanded, nor do they purport  to. Applications that process attacker-supplied XML using Xerces are  vulnerable to SSRF attacks unless they use both  setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities",  false) and  setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false).  The OWASP XXE document should be updated to mention  external-parameter-entities. I will do this as soon as my OWASP wiki  account is approved.
