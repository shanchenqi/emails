Use  (It is possible that, with more information, multiple CVE IDs may have been assigned. In CVE, missing input validation is often not considered a single type of vulnerability, e.g., failure to recognize that a parameter must be an integer could lead to both XSS and SQL injection, and two CVE IDs would be assigned. Here, however, there is no statement of which of (or how many of) the concerns in is the motivation for treating the missing input validation as a vulnerability. Thus, only one CVE ID makes sense. Note that "reported a particular exploit possibility" suggests that there is at least one motivation. If TYPO3 CORE were unaffected, and the change were made solely to address a theoretical possibility that an extension could misuse the _SERVER["HTTP_HOST"] value, then a CVE ID may not have been assigned.)   > Vulnerable subcomponent: Color Picker Wizard > Vulnerability Type: Insecure Unserialize  Use   > Vulnerable subcomponent: Backend > Vulnerability Type: Cross-Site Scripting  Use   > Vulnerable subcomponent: ExtJS > Vulnerability Type: Cross-Site Scripting > delete the file typo3/contrib/extjs/resources/charts.swf  It seems likely that this is a copy of some version of the YUI charts.swf file. If so, this issue can be mapped to an existing CVE such as or Going further, it seems plausible that different versions of TYPO3 might incorporate different versions of ExtJS, and different versions of ExtJS might incorporate charts.swf from different versions of YUI. Although we would like to offer a precise CVE mapping, at this point it seems reasonable to map the "Vulnerable subcomponent: ExtJS" part of to both and   > Vulnerable subcomponent: Authentication > Vulnerability Type: Improper Session Invalidation  Use   > Vulnerable subcomponent: Authentication > Vulnerability Type: Authentication Bypass > Affected Versions: All TYPO3 versions not configured to use salted passwords  Use  This CVE ID is for the issue, i.e., the "can be used directly to authenticate" statement in the Security Bulletin. There is no CVE ID assigned for either of the issues, i.e.,    - salting is not the default before 4.6   - salting is not mandatory before 6.2  Those are considered security improvements, because the vendor is not specifically making an announcement that they are vulnerability fixes (or, at least, that announcement isn't in the Security Bulletin).   > Vulnerable subcomponent: Extbase Framework > Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure > Failing to respect user groups of logged in users when caching queries  Use  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =58uw -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
