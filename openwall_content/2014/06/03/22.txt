I can attest that Monty is my colleague and the Manager of VMware Security Response Center. As a former colleague of you (Kurt) and also former linux-distros subscriber, I would like to ask for your consideration for subscribing Monty (or myself) to linux-distros on behalf of VMware. Although ESXi isn't a Linux distribution, it implements Linux-compatible system calls and provides a GNU/Linux -like ecosystem that allows many applications that are compiled on/for Linux operating systems to run seamlessly. This ecosystem includes OSS that should be supported in timely fashion pretty much like like any other Linux distribution on the list. It also implements a Linux kernel module interface and uses many Linux device drivers and kernel modules that also should be supported. In addition, ESXi is the base layer that many of the Linux distributions on the list rely upon and run atop of in many datacenters around the world.  Let me know if you have any questions, and thanks again for your consideration.  >  > - -- > Kurt Seifried - Red Hat - Product Security - Cloud stuff and such > PGP: A90B 66BF >  >  >  - -- Ramon de C Valle VMware Product Security Engineering -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Comment: GPGTools - https://gpgtools.org  7kTwahEuwvKWPSl3xhFl =xpy6 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
