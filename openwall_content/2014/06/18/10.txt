By creating an IPv6 private subnet attached to a L3 router, an authenticated user may break the L3-agent, preventing further floating IPv4 addresses from being attached for the entire cloud. Note: removal of the faulty network can not be done using the API and must be cleaned at the database level. Only Neutron setups using IPv6 and L3-agent are affected.  Juno (development branch) fix:  Icehouse fix:  Havana fix:  Notes: This fix will be included in the Juno-2 development milestone and in future and releases.
