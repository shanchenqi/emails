CONTAINERS DO NOT CONTAIN.  Root inside the container == Root outside the container.  This is true in both libvirt-sandbox/libvirt-lxc and docker.  We have a long way to go before we can run anything within a container without this rule.  User Namespace, SELinux or other MAC are all required to get us near the point where Container Contain.   People who run services within a container should continue to drop privs in the services and run them as UID!=0     Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
