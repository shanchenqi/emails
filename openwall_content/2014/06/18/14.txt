Though the PHP code is not distributed as a library, it is presented as a copy-and-paste server side implementation to match the jQuery module, and sites that have done so, or have left the jcryption.php file on their server, are vulnerable.  This vulnerability (at least) allows an attacker to read arbitrary files, including the RSA private key used by jCryption.  jCryption fixes the issue and is available at http://www.jcryption.org/.  Details are in the advisory on my blog:  --  David Tomaschik OpenPGP: http://systemoverlord.com david@...temoverlord.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
