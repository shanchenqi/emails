Based on the  description of the tool at [1], my uneducated guess is it would allow an  unprivileged user to control (if the output file is created in a  directory they can access) a DNS server via rndc.  Could a CVE be assigned if one has not been already?  The Debian bug also notes a similar issue was fixed in ldns - I've asked  for more details about that in the bug).
