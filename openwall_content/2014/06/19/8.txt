Take into account that the "statement" list will be rendered to a String, composed with other script fragments into a final bash script, uploaded to a node, and executed there locally as a bash script.  That code won't be executed in the machine running jclouds, but as a bash script in the provisioned node, so the name of the temporal directory should better be generated in the script itself. A good approach would be to directly use the "mktemp"command.
