Both of these issues have been fixed in the release:   Thanks,  -- Murray McAllister / Red Hat Product Security  On PM, Graham Dumpleton wrote: > Fixed and released in mod_wsgi Available through the normal download locations for mod_wsgi. > > https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/mod_wsgi/releases > https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mod_wsgi > > Thanks for highlighting the issues. > > Graham > > On at PM, Graham Dumpleton <graham.dumpleton@...il.com> wrote: > >> I saw the email as it popped up in my twitter feed of all places. >> >> Am about to make a release which improves the error handling and the one off error. >> >> Graham >> >> On at PM, Solar Designer <solar@...nwall.com> wrote: >> >>> On Wed, Jun 18, at Matthew Daley wrote: >>>> I may be wrong as I haven't been following this discussion entirely, but... >>> >>> I think Graham is not on oss-security.
