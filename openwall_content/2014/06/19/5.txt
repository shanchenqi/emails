Classic kernel:  if (!uid) { 	// perform privileged operation here }  Containers-enabled kernel:  if ( !uid && !container_id )	// container_id: 0 for host { 	// perform privileged operation here }  How would you bypass this check to get privileged access to anything outside the container?   --  Alexey V.
