I can't find any references on whether or not this is part of the UPNP spec or known behaviour, however.  Either way, I suppose that anyone running such a bittorrent client isn't expecting that all ports start forwarding (but, as a result, I'm not sure if this is malfunctioning firewall which is where knowing whether or not this is according to spec would be good).  So I'm not just asking for a CVE, but whether or not it's a flaw (I don't know enough about UPNP to hazard a guess).
