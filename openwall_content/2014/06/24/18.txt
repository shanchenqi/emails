Corrected:      UTC (stable/10,                 UTC                 UTC (stable/9, 9.3-PRERELEASE)                 UTC (releng/9.3,                 UTC (releng/9.2,                 UTC (releng/9.1,                 UTC (stable/8, 8.4-STABLE)                 UTC (releng/8.4, CVE Name:        For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the following sections, please visit <URL:http://security.FreeBSD.org/>.  I.   Background  The file(1) utility attempts to classify file system objects based on filesystem, magic number and language tests.  The libmagic(3) library provides most of the functionality of file(1) and may be used by other applications.  II.  Problem Description  A specifically crafted Composite Document File (CDF) file can trigger an out-of-bounds read or an invalid pointer dereference.  A flaw in regular expression in the awk script detector makes use of multiple wildcards with unlimited repetitions.  A malicious input file could trigger infinite recursion in libmagic(3).  A specifically crafted Portable Executable (PE) can trigger out-of-bounds read.  III. Impact  An attacker who can cause file(1) or any other applications using the libmagic(3) library to be run on a maliciously constructed input can the application to crash or consume excessive CPU resources, resulting in a denial-of-service.  IV.  Workaround  No workaround is available, but systems where file(1) and other libmagic(3)-using applications are never run on untrusted input are not vulnerable.  V.   Solution  Perform one of the following:  1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.  2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:  The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable FreeBSD release branches.  a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.  [FreeBSD 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, # fetch # fetch # gpg --verify file.patch.asc  [FreeBSD 8.4] # fetch # fetch # gpg --verify file.patch.asc  b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:  # cd /usr/src # patch < /path/to/patch  c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as described in <URL:http://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.  Restart all deamons using the library, or reboot the system.  3) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:  Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the or amd64 platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:  # freebsd-update fetch # freebsd-update install  VI.  Correction details  The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each affected branch.
