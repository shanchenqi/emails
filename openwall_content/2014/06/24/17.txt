I.   Background  The iconv(3) API allows converting text data from one character set encoding to another.  Applications first open a converter between two encodings using iconv_open(3) and then convert text using iconv(3). HZ is an encoding of the character set used for simplified Chinese characters.  VIQR is an encoding for Vietnamese characters.  II.  Problem Description  A NULL pointer dereference in the initialization code of the HZ module and an out of bounds array access in the initialization code of the VIQR module make iconv_open(3) calls involving HZ or VIQR result in an application crash.  III. Impact  Services where an attacker can control the arguments of an iconv_open(3) call can be caused to crash resulting in a denial-of-service.  For example, an email encoded in HZ may cause an email delivery service to crash if it converts emails to a more generic encoding like UTF-8 before applying filtering rules.  IV.  Workaround  No workaround is available, but systems that do not process untrusted Chinese or Vietnamese input are not affected by this vulnerability.  V.   Solution  Perform one of the following:  1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.  2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:  The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable FreeBSD release branches.  a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.  [FreeBSD # fetch # fetch # gpg --verify iconv.patch.asc  b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:  # cd /usr/src # patch < /path/to/patch  c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as described in <URL:http://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.  Restart all deamons using the library, or reboot the system.  3) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:  Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the or amd64 platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:  # freebsd-update fetch # freebsd-update install  VI.  Correction details  The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each affected branch.  Branch/path                                                      Revision - ------------------------------------------------------------------------- stable/10/                                                                                                             - -------------------------------------------------------------------------  To see which files were modified by a particular revision, run the following command, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number, on a machine with Subversion installed:  # svn diff -cNNNNNN --summarize svn://svn.freebsd.org/base  Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number:  <URL:http://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&revision=NNNNNN>  VII.
