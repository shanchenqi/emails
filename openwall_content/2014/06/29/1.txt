Zarafa WebAccess and WebApp store session information, including login credentials, on-disk in PHP session files. This session file contains a user's username and password to the Zarafa server in cleartext Depending on the configured user backend in Zarafa this might affect Zarafa internal users only or even LDAP user credentials used by multiple services.  Affected products: Zarafa WebAccess <                    Zarafa WebApp < 1.6 beta  Access Vector: Local Access Complexity: Low Authentication: None Confidentiality Impact: Partial Integrity Impact: None Availability Impact: None  The flaw is solved in Zarafa WebAccess and Zarafa WebApp 1.6 beta by using PHP's OpenSSL support, namely openssl_encrypt() and openssl_decrypt(). However this requires PHP >= while some Linux distributions like RHEL/CentOS 5 or SLES 10 ship PHP < 5.3 by default. On such systems Zarafa remains affected by this flaw.  As of writing there is no final release of Zarafa WebApp 1.6, thus installing the pre-release or backporting relevant code is required.
