Depending on configuration, this may be usable to escalate privileges. A cursory inspection of my Fedora box suggests that it is not vulnerable to the obvious way to exploit this bug.  The fix should appear in Linus' -master shortly, and it's tagged for stable.  In the mean time, I've attached it here.  I'll follow up in a day or two with a description of the actual bug, or one of you can try to beat me to it.  --Andy  View attachment of type "text/x-diff" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
