This statement just enforces what I said above. There are so many problems in this statement that I don't even know where to start. It is my understanding that you're comparing ESXi with BusyBox, although they're different things and ESXi uses BusyBox (which you probably didn't know).  If we enter in the merit of virtualization products (and cloud services), you may or may not have noticed but the majority of them are already subscribed (albeit indirectly) but VMware. Amazon, Canonical, Oracle, Red Hat, are all present. Let's assume, for example, that a critical vulnerability in a critical OSS that affects not only the Linux distributions but also the virtualization products (and cloud services) of any of the companies mentioned above is disclosed on the list. We both know that this information will be used not only to fix the vulnerability in the Linux distributions but also in all the other products and services of these companies in advance. Don't you think it's a bit unfair? I could easily assume that you are biased towards VMware not being subscribed to the list. But we aren't going to enter in that merit, are we?  So far I have explained many reasons why we should be subscribed to the list, yet you haven't explained any why we shouldn't (despite the "you're not a Linux distribution" above, which I have said myself in my very first post).  >  > - -- > Kurt Seifried - Red Hat - Product Security - Cloud stuff and such > PGP: A90B 66BF - - -- Ramon de C Valle VMware Product Security Engineering -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Comment: GPGTools - https://gpgtools.org  =I3TM -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
