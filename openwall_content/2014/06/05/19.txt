There are different default-password problems that seem to have been fixed at substantially different times, and this would often require separate CVEs.  The issue reported in apparently included a default password of mooo. Use of mooo apparently stopped after (September  Commits such as suggest that other default-password issues were fixed in apparently including password, marionette, mongopass, OSEnterprise, and changeme.  To have one CVE for everything, you'd need a situation similar to:     1. one version released by Red Hat was based on code such as             which has both the mooo issue and other default-password issues     2. the next version released by Red Hat fixed the mooo issue and       the other default-password issues  Is that what you mean, i.e., no release had a partial fix?  (The reason this question originally came up is that the wording in is "the optional installer also did this." You've now clarified that the reason for those MONGO_PASSWORD= lines in broker.conf is that the product was installed by this optional installer. However, a need for multiple CVEs is still possible, as reflected in the question above.)  Finally, are any of the CVEs duplicates of or Those two CVE IDs are mentioned at https://github.com/openshift/openshift-extras/blob/master/README.md but the only attempted documentation seems to be links to nonexistent access.redhat.com URLs, and the two CVE IDs don't seem to be in Aliases fields in Red Hat Bugzilla.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
