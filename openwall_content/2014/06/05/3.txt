If new then manually? from the script? In this case it was that specific install script which was also documented as a possible install method, thus I felt it deserved a CVE.    Correct, however in this case we document it as an install method, so I felt it deserved a CVE, had it not been documented/mentioned I would have not assigned a CVE at all since it would have been "example code" for lack of a better term.    ?  - --  Kurt Seifried - Red Hat - Product Security - Cloud stuff and such PGP: A90B 66BF    -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =Kr7J -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
