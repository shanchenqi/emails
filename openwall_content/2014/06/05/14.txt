The first is in PHP's configure script:  char *filename = "/tmp/phpglibccheck";  (Red Hat bug:  The second issue is Lynis writing a predictable file to /tmp/. Looking  at the source I cannot tell which file that is, but 2 runs on Fedora 20  revealed the following file being used each time:  /tmp/ffiYFc1nZ  I cannot find that in the source. I do not know if lynsis exec()'s any  other scripts or programs. The full disclosure report might be referring  to the following in include/tests_webservers:    39     if [ "${OS}" = "AIX" ]; then   40         TMPFILE=/tmp/lynis.$$  Thanks,  -- Murray McAllister / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
