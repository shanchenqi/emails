Corrected:      UTC (stable/10,                 UTC                 UTC (stable/9,                 UTC (stable/9,                 UTC (releng/9.2,                 UTC (releng/9.1,                 UTC (stable/8, 8.4-STABLE)                 UTC (releng/8.4, CVE Name:        For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the following sections, please visit <URL:http://security.FreeBSD.org/>.  I.   Background  FreeBSD includes software from the OpenSSL Project.  The OpenSSL Project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength general purpose cryptography library.  II.  Problem Description  Receipt of an invalid DTLS fragment on an OpenSSL DTLS client or server can lead to a buffer overrun.  Receipt of an invalid DTLS handshake on an OpenSSL DTLS client can lead the code to unnecessary recurse.   Carefully crafted handshake can force the use of weak keying material in OpenSSL SSL/TLS clients and servers.  Carefully crafted packets can lead to a NULL pointer deference in OpenSSL TLS client code if anonymous ECDH ciphersuites are enabled.  III. Impact  A remote attacker may be able to run arbitrary code on a vulnerable client or server by sending invalid DTLS fragments to an OpenSSL DTLS client or server.  A remote attacker who can send an invalid DTLS handshake to an OpenSSL DTLS client can crash the remote OpenSSL DTLS client.  A remote attacker who can send a carefully crafted handshake can force the use of weak keying material between a vulnerable client and a vulnerable server and decrypt and/or modify traffic from the attacked client and server in a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.  A remote attacker who can send carefully crafted packets can cause OpenSSL TLS client to crash.   IV.  Workaround  No workaround is available.  V.   Solution  Perform one of the following:  1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.  2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:  The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable FreeBSD release branches.  a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.  [FreeBSD # fetch # fetch # gpg --verify openssl-10.patch.asc  [FreeBSD 9.x and 8.x] # fetch # fetch # gpg --verify openssl-9.patch.asc  b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:  # cd /usr/src # patch < /path/to/patch  c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as described in <URL:http://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.  Restart all deamons using the library, or reboot the system.  3) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:  Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the or amd64 platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:  # freebsd-update fetch # freebsd-update install  VI.  Correction details  The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each affected branch.
