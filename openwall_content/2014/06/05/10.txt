I'm missing how your ability to do this for your product is of value to the open source community, however.  What is VMware bringing to the table here in terms of value provided to the other members of linux-distros due to having VMware as a member?  This is an honest question.  There may well be substantial value that I'm not seeing.  Alternately, I could also understand if your argument is that this is not the calculus that was used to judge other, current members, or that the criteria for membership should be the simple question of whether the organization uses Linux and related software and would benefit from advance notification of security vulnerabilities.  (By that argument, other organizations, such as Apple, should also be eligible for membership.)  An aside: I personally, speaking as someone who is not a member but who has reported embargoed security vulerabilities to linux-distros in the past and doubtless will in the future, would prefer to restrict linux-distros membership to the organizations that are actively contributing to the security of open source software in ways beyond simply redistributing it.  In other words, I would prefer if linux-distros were restricted to only organizations with active security teams and a track record of finding vulnerabilities, developing fixes, coordinating security fixes among open source distributions, or contributing substantially to those groups that are doing so.  I view advance notification as a valuable courtesy to help Linux distributions make their products more secure, and would prefer to only extend that courtesy to those organizations who have contributed something back to the community of which I'm part.  Organizations that choose not to contribute substantially can receive notification at the same time as the general public.  This is a possibly idiosyncratic opinion, and I know it is not the current criteria for membership.  --  Russ Allbery (eagle@...ie.org)              <http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/>  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
