This would depend on how you installed it, e.g. as an upgrade?a new install? If new then manually? from the script? In this case it was that specific install script which was also documented as a possible install method, thus I felt it deserved a CVE.  > 2. There was also an issue in an example script.

Correct, however in this case we document it as an install method, so I felt it deserved a CVE, had it not been documented/mentioned I would have not assigned a CVE at all since it would have been "example code" for lack of a better term.  > 3. The CVE IDs in 1 and 2 can't be the same.  ?  - --  Kurt Seifried - Red Hat - Product Security - Cloud stuff and such PGP: A90B 66BF    -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =/kfN -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
