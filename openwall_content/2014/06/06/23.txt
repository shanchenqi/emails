This allows an attacker who can provide part of a JSON-serializable object to craft a string that can break out of a <script> tag and create its own, injecting a custom script.  To fix this, we escape '<', '>', and '&' characters in the resulting string, preventing a </script> from executing.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  How reproducible: Every time   Steps to Reproduce: 1. User can change their display name to "</script><script> alert(1)</script>" 2. Browse a page where this user was the submitter  Actual results: Script is executed  Expected results: User's name should be sanitized  Additional info: Issue is public, due to it having been reported on upstream's public bug tracker.  Upstream bug report:  Upstream patch: Djblets 0.7.x: Djblets 0.8.x:  I do not yet have the real name of the reporter to credit.     == XSS Vulnerability in Djblets gravatar templates == Description of problem: The generated gravatar HTML wasn't handling escaping of the display name of the user, allowing an attacker to choose a name that would close out the <img> tag and inject a <script> tag.  By switching to Django's format_html(), we can guarantee safe escaping of content.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  How reproducible: Every time  Steps to Reproduce: 1. User can change their display name to "</script><script> alert(1)</script>" 2. Configure this user for a Gravatar image 3. Browse to any page displaying the gravatar image  Actual results: The script executes  Expected results: The username should be properly sanitized and prevent XSS execution.  Additional info: Issue is public now as the fix has now been committed to upstream git.  Credit for the discovery of this vulnerability should be given to Christian Hammond of Bean Bag, Inc. (author of Review Board).  This issue is present in the python-djblets package on Fedora 19, 20, Rawhide and EPEL 6 (EPEL 7 has not yet had a successful build).
