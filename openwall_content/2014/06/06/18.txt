"known problem" to whom?  :)  With that kind of attitude, you are going to miss a lot of valuable kernel fixes for issues.  I'd recommend using a stable kernel release instead, but hey, it's your systems...  > Want to make sure the changed stuff doesn't lead to a regression > somewhere else.

There are futex test suites out there, run them yourself to verify that nothing is broken. As for if it fixes potentially future problems that others might not know about, well, that's a gamble on everyone's part, right?  > Anyway, I've applied all the (2+4) patches to our   Why are you "stuck" at  There is someone still maintaining why not rely on those releases if you want that kernel version, instead of rolling your own?  thanks,  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
