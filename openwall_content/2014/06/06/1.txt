In there is this change (ignoring whitespace changes):          curval = cmpxchg_futex_value_locked(uaddr, uval, newval); - -               if (curval == -EFAULT) +       if (curval)                 ret = -EFAULT;  which seems to change the behaviour of the function.  The purpose of the return value of cmpxchg_futex_value_locked changed in  "futex: Sanitize cmpxchg_futex_value_locked API"  which is not included in This patch changes the return value to a status code, but in the return value is the value of the futex or -EFAULT. With this backported patch, any futex with a non-zero value will return -EFAULT.  Can you please clarify whether this change was intentional or is an error introduced in the backport?
