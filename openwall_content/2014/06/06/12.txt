We probably can't make a CVE assignment for this because the primary affected product is unknown, and this /tmp/ffiYFc1nZ observation might already be covered by a previous CVE. Lynis apparently runs many other scripts and programs; for example, there are hundreds of    FIND=`  lines.  > The full disclosure report might be referring to the following in > include/tests_webservers: >  >   39     if [ "${OS}" = "AIX" ]; then >   40         TMPFILE=/tmp/lynis.$$  We can make a CVE assignment corresponding to your disclosure of this lynis.$$ issue on oss-security. Use A CVE for this most likely won't (or shouldn't) have a reference unless the original fulldisclosure author confirms the association.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =Ltzt -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
