The corrected patch is below  ---  >From Mon Sep 17 From: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@...utronix.de> Date: Tue, 3 Jun Subject: [PATCH 3/4] futex: Always cleanup owner tid in unlock_pi  If the owner died bit is set at futex_unlock_pi, we currently do not cleanup the user space futex. So the owner TID of the current owner (the unlocker) persists. That's observable inconsistant state, especially when the ownership of the pi state got transferred.  Clean it up unconditionally.
