I did read your earlier message. To answer your question: I only apply patches that are absolutely necessary to fix a known problem. Want to make sure the changed stuff doesn't lead to a regression somewhere else. Futex stuff is a central component in the kernel ... I can't judge about any possible side effects from reading the code ... and this kernel is going on a number of production  clusters.  Anyway, I've applied all the (2+4) patches to our  "futex: Make lookup_pi_state more robust" needed slight adjustment, but nothing serious. I'll go and test now. If someone wants the patch set, let me know. Then I can post it to the list.
