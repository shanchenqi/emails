Horde has a simple function wrapper, Horde_Ldap::bind, around PHP's ldap_bind function. This function takes a DN and password as arguments, both with default values of null. If either of these arguments is empty() (as in, the PHP standard library function empty()), the LDAP bind user DN or password from Horde configuration is passed to ldap_bind instead.  I'm guessing the intent is that the function can be used to easily (re-)bind as the bind user by calling it with no arguments (making them default to null and therefore passing the empty check).  The issue is that empty() returns true not just for null values but also - amongst other things - for empty strings. Hence, a user can simply provide an empty password when logging in and the function will default it to the bind user's password. All the user then needs to guess is the same bind user's DN (ie. username, so probably something like 'horde' or 'admin') and they can log in.  (Note that IIRC you can't provide an empty username to get that to default as well; Horde checks for a non-empty username but not an non-empty password.)  So, this issue was actually Horde-specific and not a generic LDAP server configuration issue, which I think qualifies for a CVE, FWIW.
