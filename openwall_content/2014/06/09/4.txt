Sorry, how is this really relevant?  setExpandEntityReferences(false) does not prevent expansion of general entities, so I'm not sure why expansion of parameter entities is the problem.  > I did end up releasing my paper recently, which I believe has > up-to-date recommendations for Xerces: >   http://vsecurity.com/download/papers/XMLDTDEntityAttacks.pdf  It continues to mention setExpandEntityReferences, hinting that should be expected to provide security protections (text seems to imply external entities are not expanded in documents, but they are still defined and remote URLs fetched).  As previously mentioned, the setting only changes DOM tree layout, and does not disable entity expansion.  E.g. parsing the following two inputs (one using internal other external general entity):  $ cat test1.xml  <?xml version="1.0"?> <!DOCTYPE bleh [ <!ENTITY bar "BAR"> ]> <root>foo &bar; baz</root>  $ cat test2.xml  <?xml version="1.0"?> <!DOCTYPE bleh [ <!ENTITY bar SYSTEM "test2-bar.txt"> ]> <root>foo &bar; baz</root>  $ cat test2-bar.txt  BAR  Setting setExpandEntityReferences to false changes the tree from:  - (Element) <root>   - (Text) foo BAR baz  to:  - (Element) <root>   - (Text) foo    - (Entity Reference) &bar;   - (Text) BAR baz  &bar; is expanded to BAR either way.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
