Is there anything you can add as to how long this bug has been in the codebase ?  In particular, is the Kmail in Debian 'oldstable' systems affected (squeeze/kdelibs or that in Debian 'stable' systems (wheezy/kdelibs ?  I'm not sure whether to interpret the 'Versions' line in the advisory as "bug was introduced at kdelibs - and there is no further information on the CVE at Mitre [1], or in the Debian bug [2]; there appears to be no relevant bug at bugs.kde.org (a search for the CVE, or any of the keywords "kdelibs pop3 ssl kioslave" returns nothing relevant).  There is an IBM ISS report [3] which implies the bug affects at least kdelibs 4.6.x ....
