However, having contributed to both OpenSSL and LibreSSL (albeit modestly) and having been actively tracking both projects, I've seen many synergies in action.  For example, LibreSSL has taken issues/fixes directly from OpenSSL's RT tracker while OpenSSL has adopted/modified fixes from LibreSSL. As the security community is aware of, moreso than most regular end-users, this positive feedback mechanism benefits both projects and ultimately everyone within the ecosystem.  In that sense, supporting OpenSSL and LibreSSL sequentially rather than concurrently limits the role CII can play in catalyzing synergies between the projects.  Moreover, if CII support helps OpenBSD realize/accelerate a portable LibreSSL version, users on many platforms will benefit from the increased choice - competition breeds success.  Matt, I have added you to the CC list because as co-founder of OCAP you can share with us how the progress OpenBSD has already made with auditing OpenSSL will factor into OCAP's own OpenSSL audit. And, because you also sit on CII's advisory board, you might be able to help us by forwarding this thread to the appropriate person(s) at CII so they can elaborate on how OpenBSD's LibreSSL support request is progressing.
