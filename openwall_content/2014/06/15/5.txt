Since then I've either asked redhat or one of the other OSS vendors for a CVE. I've used the distros@...openwall.org now as a fallback.  I'd also note as part of the meta discussion that I'm not going to release details of vulnerabilities to a public list  before the fix, and just because someone asks for more details doesn't mean I will provide them. - I have no way to know who the person asking is. If getting a CVE assigned becomes a problem then the solution from my side will be to release the advisory then let someone else sort out assigning CVEs afterwards.  Cheers  Rich.
