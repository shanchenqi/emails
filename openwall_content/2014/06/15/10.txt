I have received no response either time, therefore I am raising it on  oss-security.  describes a well-known issue in Apache Struts 1:  "It was found that the Struts 1 ActionForm object allowed access to the  'class' parameter, which is directly mapped to the getClass() method. A  remote attacker could use this flaw to manipulate the ClassLoader used  by an application server running Struts 1. This could lead to remote  code execution under certain conditions."  The root cause of this flaw is that commons-beanutils exposes the class  property by default, with no mechanism to disable access to it. Struts 1  is considered EOL upstream, and upstream has not yet shipped a patch for  this flaw. Red Hat has shipped a patch, which was submitted upstream as  a pull request:  https://github.com/apache/struts1/pull/1  This patch disables access to the class property in struts itself,  rather than in commons-beanutils. Other frameworks built on  commons-beanutils, such as Apache Stripes, are likely to expose similar  issues. I think it would be a good idea to also assign a separate CVE ID  to commons-beanutils, and ship a patch for commons-beanutils itself. The  commons-beanutils patch could be inherited by other frameworks that may  not have the resources to produce their own patch.  commons-beanutils has now shipped:   Incorporating a patch for this issue:   "A specialized BeanIntrospector implementation has been added which  allows suppressing properties. There is also a pre-configured instance  removing the class property from beans. Some notes have been added to  the user's guide."  I think it would be appropriate to assign a CVE ID to this issue in  commons-beanutils, and publish an advisory. This would provide framework  developers with the necessary information and impetus to upgrade to  commons-beanutils and make use of SuppressPropertiesBeanIntrospector.
