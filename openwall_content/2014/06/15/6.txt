Thanks for noting this, but we haven't been able to find why that happened. We did a complete search and there's never been any e-mail received at the cve-assign@...re.org address from any kde.org sender or the name Richard Moore or Rich Moore. Before October we advertised a different address, cve@...re.org, reaching different people at MITRE, but unfortunately do not have the full archive of that online. We sent one reply in December from cve-assign@...re.org to a kde.org address in response to e-mail sent to cve@...re.org (it was related to the post).  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =7E3L -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
