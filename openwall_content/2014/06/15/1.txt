The vulnerability is exploitable on versions up to by local users with read access to `/dev/media0`. Linux distributions ship with `chmod /dev/media0` preventing unprivileged local users from exploiting the vulnerability. However, some Android devices are known to be shipped with both read and/or write permissions for all: chmod /dev/media0.
