Here's a list of commits to the ffmpeg repository which look like they might fix trouble. I don't think CVEs are assigned for these, but it's a long list, so I'm not completely sure.  I don't know if it's worth the trouble to assign CVEs for these now, since they all were fixed last year, but I thought I'd bring them to your attention. Please use your own judgment.
