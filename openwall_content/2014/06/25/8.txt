In web applications that function correctly with the HTTPOnly flag for a cookie, absence of this flag might be categorized as a ("Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere") issue. In general, factors that can be considered include:    -- are there compatibility downsides to setting the flag? (An      example of a downside might be: a popular but noncompliant      browser completely ignores the cookie if the flag is set.)       [ Obviously each CVE assignment is on a per-product basis, and        there wouldn't be a CVE about HTTPOnly if a product's design        relies on script access to a cookie. ]    -- does the flag interfere with plausible use cases? (An example of      a use case might be: script code that doesn't need to know the      value of a cookie, but was designed to read the cookie anyway to      assess whether an attack involving long cookie values is      occurring.)    -- are there vendors who recommend against the flag?    -- compared to the development cost in arranging for the flag to be      set, is it possible that the real-life benefit is too small?    -- are there other known or potential costs to setting the flag?      (There might not be a good example here, e.g., there probably      aren't bandwidth considerations where 9 or 10 more bytes is a      deal breaker.)  If the answer to all of these questions is no, then it starts becoming reasonable to argue that absence of the flag is an implementation error.  > like running SELinux (or AppArmor), running a virus scanner, and > having a firewall  All of those seem to, in practice, have a relatively much greater chance of introducing new vulnerabilities because of the required implementation complexity.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =MYyX -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
