An attacker with read access to the message queue may obtain authentication tokens used in REST requests (X_AUTH_TOKEN) that goes through the notifier middleware. All services using the notifier middleware configured after the auth_token middleware pipeline are impacted.  pyCADF fix (included in release):      (pyCADF)  Juno (development branch) fix:      (Neutron)  Icehouse fix:     (Neutron)      (Ceilometer)  Havana fix:     (Ceilometer)  Notes: Ceilometer Juno (master) branch is not affected. Those fixes will be included in the Juno-2 development milestone and in future and releases.
