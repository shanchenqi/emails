If one has module-rtp-recv loaded into PulseAudio, then a remote  attacker can crash this instance of PulseAudio by sending an empty UDP  packet to the multicast address where module-rtp-recv has decided to  receive the stream due to a previous SAP/SDP announcement.  When PulseAudio crashes, it says to the log:  E: Analog] memblock.c: Assertion 'b' failed at  function  pa_memblock_unref(). Aborting.  So this doesn't look exploitable - just a DoS attack, and PulseAudio  usually gets respawned anyway.  The problem has been reported upstream, but got no response yet:   The problematic code is in the pa_rtp_recv() function, in the handling  of the result of the FIONREAD ioctl. It existed since the introduction  of the module, i.e. since (git commit which is  before version 1.0.  The problem I found is that the function just returns immediately,  without even attempting to read the zero-sized packet. I don't know how  this later leads to the failed assertion.   A patch has been sent, but not reviewed and thus not accepted, and thus  the problem still exists in git master:   I have also tested SAP/SDP handling for the same type of vulnerability,  but PulseAudio survived an empty UDP packet there just fine.  --  Alexander E.
