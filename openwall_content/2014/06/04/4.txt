As a former colleague of you (Kurt) and also former linux-distros subscriber, I would like to ask for your consideration for subscribing Monty (or myself) to linux-distros on behalf of VMware. Although ESXi isn't a Linux distribution, it implements Linux-compatible system calls and provides a GNU/Linux -like ecosystem that allows many applications that are compiled on/for Linux operating systems to run seamlessly. This ecosystem includes OSS that should be supported in timely fashion pretty much like like any other Linux distribution on the list. It also implements a Linux kernel module interface and uses many Linux device drivers and kernel modules that also should be supported. In addition, ESXi is the base layer that many of the Linux distributions on the list rely upon and run atop of in many datacenters around the world. >  > Thank you, Ramon.

I don't know of any specific OSS software of their own, except for some Linux kernel module code in the kernel source tree[2], which really doesn't justify the need to be part of linux-distros in my opinion.  thanks,  greg k-h  [1] My opinion only, not my employers.  I am not a lawyer, please     consult with your own before making a decision about this if you     should be using vmware products yourself.  Details about why I think     this are available on demand on an individual basis. [2] Nothing to do with [1], a totally different thing.
