I don't think is the role of bash to do this as the problem that could be exploited by that would really be in the original program that does not drop privs before invoking the shell. This has been known for some time in some circles at least, but as I said the problem would really be in the non-priv-dropping privileged program, that's why most people did not really care that much. Last year there was a vuln that is very much related to this subject:  Correct me if I'm wrong, but even in that case there is another "help" measure that has been implemented at least in linux kernels > 3.1:  Therefore setuid calls do not fail anymore even in the case of existing resource limits for processes (in linux).  But in any case, for the sake of correctness I agree that the drop_priv code should be fixed (or just completely removed...).
