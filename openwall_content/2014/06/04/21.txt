However, in addition to the reasons explained above and also Alan's comments (which, IMO, also add to our reasons), I'd also appreciate comments by others active in this community and would be happy to answer any questions anyone might have.  >  > Does VMware have OSS products? We have some (minor) open source software and libraries at http://github.com/vmware, and also others hosted at SourceForge, such as http://vmware-svga.sourceforge.net. (Not sure if these are significant for this request, though.)    Would it be reasonable to include VMware > security advisory/contact details on our wiki? I've added our security advisory/contact details to the wiki.  - -- Ramon de C Valle VMware Product Security Engineering -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Comment: GPGTools - https://gpgtools.org  =Pcv+ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
