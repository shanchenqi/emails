Apparently there are realistic circumstances in which respawning doesn't happen (possibly a zero value of conf->daemonize or the "User-configured server at %s, refusing to start/autospawn." case in http://cgit.freedesktop.org/pulseaudio/pulseaudio/tree/src/daemon/main.c).   >  > expecting to find an infinite loop (as it would be common for such > FIONREAD misuse), but found an assertion failure instead.

The scope of does not include any infinite loop that might be discovered later.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJTjztGAAoJEKllVAevmvmspWYIAMDODhaMo0EfkzPHhhmadz1H =3Sw2 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
