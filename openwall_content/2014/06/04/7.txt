Though that speaks to being a member of the OSS community in general, and in producing software for which announcements might go to distros, not necessarily for being on the receiving end.  --  	-Alan Coopersmith-              alan.coopersmith@...cle.com 	 Oracle Solaris Engineering - http://blogs.oracle.com/alanc  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
