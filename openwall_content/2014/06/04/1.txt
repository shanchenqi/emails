Corrected:      UTC (stable/9,                 UTC (stable/9,                 UTC (releng/9.2,                 UTC (stable/10,                 UTC CVE Name:        For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the following sections, please visit <URL:http://security.FreeBSD.org/>.  I.   Background  The PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) library provides a flexible framework for user authentication and session setup / teardown.  It is used not only in the base system, but also by a large number of third-party applications.  Various authentication methods (UNIX, LDAP, Kerberos etc.) are implemented in modules which are loaded and executed according to predefined, named policies.  These policies are defined in /etc/pam.conf, /etc/pam.d/<policy name>, /usr/local/etc/pam.conf or /usr/local/etc/pam.d/<policy name>.  The PAM API is a de facto industry standard which has been implemented by several parties.  FreeBSD uses the OpenPAM implementation.  II.  Problem Description  The OpenPAM library searches for policy definitions in several locations.  While doing so, the absence of a policy file is a soft failure (handled by searching in the next location) while the presence of an invalid file is a hard failure (handled by returning an error to the caller).  The policy parser returns the same error code (ENOENT) when a syntactically valid policy references a non-existent module as when the requested policy file does not exist.  The search loop regards this as a soft failure and looks for the next similarly-named policy, without discarding the partially-loaded configuration.  A similar issue can arise if a policy contains an include directive that refers to a non-existent policy.  III. Impact  If a module is removed, or the name of a module is misspelled in the policy file, the PAM library will proceed with a partially loaded configuration.  Depending on the exact circumstances, this may result in a fail-open scenario where users are allowed to log in without a password, or with an incorrect password.  In particular, if a policy references a module installed by a package or port, and that package or port is being reinstalled or upgraded, there is a brief window of time during which the module is absent and policies that use it may fail open.  This can be especially damaging to Internet-facing SSH servers, which are regularly subjected to brute-force scans.  IV.  Workaround  If your system uses customized PAM policies, carefully review your policies to ensure that all module names are spelled correctly.  If your system uses third-party authentication modules, either refrain from upgrading those modules until you have patched your system, or shut down the affected services before upgrading.  V.   Solution  Perform one of the following:  1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.  2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:  The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable FreeBSD release branches.  a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.  [FreeBSD 9.2] # fetch # fetch # gpg --verify pam-freebsd9.patch.asc  [FreeBSD 9.3 and # fetch # fetch # gpg --verify pam-freebsd10.patch.asc  b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:  # cd /usr/src # patch < /path/to/patch  c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as described in <URL:http://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.  Restart all deamons using the library, or reboot the system.  3) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:  Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the or amd64 platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:  # freebsd-update fetch # freebsd-update install  VI.  Correction details  The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each affected branch.
