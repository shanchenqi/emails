I'm saying in quite a few common situations it should probably qualify for a CVE. Not every single situation.

How is not having DAC a _vulnerability_? and yet now DAC support is required....   - --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1 Comment: Using GnuPG with Thunderbird - http://www.enigmail.net/  =NlLO -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
