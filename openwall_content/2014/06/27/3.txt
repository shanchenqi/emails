I am also of the opinion that everyone did their best, and that's great.  I think actual negative impact of the delay is small or non-existent. However, I felt we must have posted these additional comments on the disclosure process in here, because it deviated from what's normally expected for issues disclosed to the distros list:  http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros#how-to-use-the-lists  "When the security issue is finally to be made public, it is your (the original reporter's) responsibility to post about it to oss-security (indeed, you and others may also post to any other mailing lists, etc.)"  I am tempted to add "on the same day" after "to oss-security", since this is what we expect (and what usually happens), but there may be occasional exceptions like this, so maybe we leave the wording as-is?
