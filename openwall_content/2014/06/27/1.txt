I've just found this note here:   I guess there was some miscommunication, because there _was_ response via comments on this issue.  Don's comment was posted on June 19, and Yann replied via multiple comments on June 20, 22, 26.  The latest one of these says "Fixed into which is:   and the commit message includes:  "fix :  Issue 52  (malicious address space overflow in 32-bits mode when using custom format)"  Per Yann's blog post, and per comments on issue 52, we should credit Ludvig Strigeus for earlier discovery of this issue specifically in LZ4, although it was not treated as a security issue until Don's rediscovery (per Yann's good reasons, it shouldn't have been, but that's arguable).  Given the above, I think all of Ludvig, Don, and indeed Yann deserve credit for getting this issue fixed, and I find it unfortunate that feelings were hurt.
