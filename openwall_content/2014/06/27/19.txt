The only use of LZO is in the Syslinux core, which uses the assembly LZO implementation, which seems to have been unaffected.  Syslinux does not use LZO on arbitrary data.  	-hpa  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1 Comment: Using GnuPG with Thunderbird - http://www.enigmail.net/  6tSmhFkxfgIE7MFttcxV =AiFW -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
