I'm not sure that I understand or agree with this.  The above sounds to me like not having a virus scanner in an OS is a security flaw, but the only reason it's not being described as such is a technicality.  Virus scanners are useful proactive security, but I don't think that means the _lack_ of one exposes a vulnerability.  The vulnerability (which should be what gets a CVE) is exposed regardless of the presence of a virus scanner -- all the scanner does is make detection easier and possibly prevent something from being executed that may otherwise be unwittingly executed (or may not, the vendor cannot make that determination).  I suppose maybe there is a CWE for not having a virus scanner, which makes sense as that could be considered an overall system weakness.  So I guess the next question is whether or not there is a 1:1 mapping for CWE and CVE (i.e. if something has a weakness (software, OS, configuration) does that automatically make it an actual vulnerability).  I'm also really confused on how any of these tasks have any bearing on what constitutes a vulnerability because they seem irrelevant as far as determining whether or not an actual flaw exists:  - lack of a proactive security mechanism (virus scanner, etc.) - customer requirements (I fail to see how this impacts whether or not something is a flaw) - release engineering work (or, possibly, "how hard is this to fix?") - feature parity with other competitors  All of these sound like marketing issues, not factors to determine whether or not a flaw is a flaw.  --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Product Security Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
