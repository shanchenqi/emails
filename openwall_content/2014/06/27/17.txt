Neither CVE nor CWE attempts to cover the general topic of system integration, i.e., questions such as "given the composition and role of this entire system, is it unreasonable to omit a virus scanner?" In practice, both CVE and CWE often tend to be about questions that may come up when considering somewhere around one line of code or one file of code. (This is just an observational statement, not an attempt to redefine why CVE and CWE exist.) Typical audiences may include (among others) developers who need to write a line of code safely or system administrators who need to patch a faulty line of code.  This doesn't mean that there's any objection to someone taking the position that lack of a virus scanner is the most serious security concern that they see in an entire system. This is a valid perspective but is outside of the problem spaces in which CVE and CWE have been operating. Even if everyone were looking at "whether or not a flaw is a flaw" decisions in precisely the same way, a conclusion of "yes, this system would really benefit from a virus scanner" leaves open the question of the best place to capture that information.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =/jC4 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
