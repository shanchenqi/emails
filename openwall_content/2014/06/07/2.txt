Use for the buffer overflow.  In the "investigated this and found it to be safe" sentence, "this" means only the second part of the original message, not the part about the buffer overflow. The while loop in the unpatched code before was not found to be safe. (For many people reading the second message, this may have been obvious because the "safe" sentence came after quoted text from only the second part of the original message.)  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =D1eB -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
