We have heard from the original fulldisclosure author, and have permission to continue with the public CVE assignments here. The new status is that refers only to the above unsafe use of /tmp/lynis.$$ on AIX. It's quite possible that Linux distributions won't produce any security updates mapping to  A second CVE ID, refers to this separate vulnerability on non-AIX platforms (i.e., any uname except for AIX):    TMPFILE=`mktemp /tmp/lynis.XXXXXX`   ...   find ${I} -name "*.conf" -print >> ${TMPFILE}.unsorted  This apparently allows a straightforward symlink attack against the ${TMPFILE}.unsorted file. Credit for this discovery belongs to the same author as in the post.  (There are two CVE IDs because the provenance of the first full public disclosure is not the same, and because the scope of had already been defined.)  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =7RvE -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
