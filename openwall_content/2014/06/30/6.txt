Use for the report in stating that check_icmp is affected. This is new vector information announced at a different time by a different party.  (From a practical perspective, someone might have been tracking Nagios Plugins security on the basis of fulldisclosure posts, and decided to "fix" by simply deleting the check_dhcp plugin. In this case, is useful because that installation was still vulnerable after that remediation action.)   > >  > This was fixed in version >  >  Use for the report in stating that check_dhcp is affected. is also an applicable reference for this CVE.)  Here, the vendor did not announce any additional vector information (and only referred to "the SUID vulnerability discovered by David Golunski") so we can't assign a fourth CVE ID for the post. It's possible that this is actually a parallel situation, so if anyone wants to announce an issue in that's not specifically about check_dhcp, an additional CVE ID could be assigned.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJTsXlEAAoJEKllVAevmvmsIs8H/0nIgPWQJWEXPckNuYNPwAof =N17g -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
