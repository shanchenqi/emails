ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  When initialising an internal data structure on ARM platform Xen was not correctly initialising the memory containing the list of a domain's grant table pages. This list is returned by the GNTTABOP_setup_table subhypercall, leading to an information leak.  IMPACT ======  Malicious guest administrators can obtain some of the memory contents of other domains:  Up to 8*max_nr_grant_frames bytes of uninitialised memory can be leaked to the calling domain. This memory may have been previously used by either the hypervisor or other guests.  The default max_nr_grant_frames is 32, hence by default bytes may be leaked in this way.  However this can be overridden via the "gnttab_max_nr_frames" hypervisor command line option.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Both 32- and 64-bit ARM systems are vulnerable from Xen 4.4 onward.  MITIGATION ==========  None.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Julien Grall.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.         xen-unstable, Xen 4.4.x  $  $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =srxg -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
