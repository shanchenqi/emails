I also need to remind the list that I did the checks using codesearch.debian.net[1,2], which is a really helpful tool for that kind of things, but:  - only indexes packages from Debian sid (so not upstream, for example) - doesn't reveal if those embedded codes are actually used.  Still, I find the amount of embedded minilzo libs (for example) worrying.  Here's the data.  For LZO:  - grub2 [3] embeds minilzo - busybox [4] embeds minilzo - syslinux [5] seems to embeds lzo but I'm unsure if the vulnerable code is really present, I can't find lzo1x_decompress_safe() code - xen [6] embeds lzo - chromium embeds lzo through ffmpeg - valgrind [7] seems to include bits of minilzo but I'm not sure the vulnerable code is present - remmina [8] includes minilzo (apparently through libvncserver) - blender [9] embeds minilzo - x11vnc embeds minilzo (twice!, through libvncserver [10] and libvncclient [11]) - italc [12] embeds minilzo  - dump [13] embeds minilzo - krfb [14] embeds minilzo through libvncserver - nfdump [15] embeds minilzo - kino [16] embeds lzo through ffmpeg - samhain [17] embeds minilzo - u-boot [18] embeds minilzo decompressor - icecc [19] emebds minilzo - bb [20] embeds minilzo - mednafen [21] embeds minilzo - ht [22] embeds minilzo - n2n [23] embeds minilzo  Apparently, libvncserver/libvncclient themselves stopped embedding minilzo, at least in Debian.   For LZ4:  - pytables [24] embeds lz4 - gtkwave [25] embeds lz4 - php-horde-lz4 [26] embeds lz4  With more generic searches we can also find some other traces.  I can find traces of lzo in:  - xine-lib [30] (obsolete, apparently embededed an ffmpeg/libav copy)  And traces of lz4 in:  - grub2 [31](zfs file system support, implementation from Yann Collet but LZ4_decompress_generic doesn't seem present) - iceweasel/firefox embeds LZ4 - efl [34] (Enlightenment Foundation Library, Yann Collet implementation, but again LZ4_decompress_generic is not present) - eet [35] (seems to be an old Enlightenment lib, not sure it's relevant anymore, embeds the Yann Collet implementation) - kfreebsd/zfsutils (obviously)  As far as I can tell there's only embedded stuff, no new implementation, but I might be wrong.
