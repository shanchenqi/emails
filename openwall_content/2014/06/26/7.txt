So with web cookies they are often used as authentication tokens (the alternative is in URL which has it's own list of problems, or form values/etc.), I would hazard to say the vast majority of all web based authentication uses cookies (I've never run into widely used certificate based or other options). Also web sites have changed, no longer static sites or "simple" CGI based sites, you pretty much always use a framework, sometimes hosting your framework within a lower level framework. Or you write custom code, whatever. The point is this stuff has XSS flaws all over the place, it's more the rule then the exception.  So with widespread XSS in mind, I think it's safe to say that virtually every web site (even sites that care deeply and spend time/money and have bug bounties) have lurking XSS flaws, which if HTTPOnly is not used can result in cookie theft. So in my mind HTTPOnly isn't an option any more, but a requirement, ergo in most situations no HTTPOnly = win a CVE.
