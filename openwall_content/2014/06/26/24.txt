Please find the bug report attached inline.  Best, Don A. Bailey Founder / CEO Lab Mouse Security https://www.securitymouse.com/  ############################################################################# # # Lab Mouse Security Report # #  Report ID:  CVE ID:  Researcher Name: Don A. Bailey Researcher Organization: Lab Mouse Security Researcher Email: donb at securitymouse.com Researcher Website: www.securitymouse.com  Vulnerability Status: Patched Vulnerability Embargo: Broken  Vulnerability Class: Integer Overflow Vulnerability Effect: Memory Corruption Vulnerability Impact: DoS, RCE Vulnerability DoS Practicality: Practical Vulnerability RCE Practicality: Practical Vulnerability Criticality: High  Vulnerability Scope: All versions of the Linux kernel (3x/2x) with LZ4 support (lib/lz4).  Functions Affected:  Criticality Reasoning --------------------- Due to the design of the algorithm, an attacker can specify any desired offset to a write pointer. The attacker can instrument the write in such a way as to only write four bytes at a specified offset. Subsequent code will allow the attacker to escape from the decompression algorithm without further memory corruption. This may allow the attacker to overwrite critical structures in memory that affect flow of execution.  Vulnerability Description ------------------------- An integer overflow can occur when processing any variant of a "literal run" in the lz4_uncompress function.  Vulnerability Resolution ------------------------ The Linux kernel team has resolved this vulnerability.
