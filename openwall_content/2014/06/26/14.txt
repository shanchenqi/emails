By that logic then we wouldn't assign CVE's for bad salt/lacking salt/bad password encryption, as the "real" vulnerability" is in the access of that data. The reality is a lot of what used to be exotic security is now becoming basic standard practice, largely I think for two simple reasons: 1) attackers keep getting better and 2) the technical security debt in most existing software keeps getting discovered to be larger.   - --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1 Comment: Using GnuPG with Thunderbird - http://www.enigmail.net/  =aMTm -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
