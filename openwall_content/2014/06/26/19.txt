The changes related to check_mode apparently mean that http://docs.ansible.com/developing_modules.html#check-mode wasn't properly implemented, and an administrator might unintentionally perform dangerous actions. CVE assignments for this type of problem seem uncommon, although that might be because the class of issues is underreported. (The bug here seems to be a case of "doesn't even notice whether check_mode is active" rather than "notices that check_mode is active but proceeds unsafely."
