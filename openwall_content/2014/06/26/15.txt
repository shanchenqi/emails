It would be very rare to assign a CVE for a design choice by a system integrator. Suppose a new operating-system distribution ships tomorrow without a virus scanner. Often the best model for this would be a set of tasks that hasn't happened. For example, the vendor hasn't yet investigated customer requirements for what a virus scanner should do. The vendor hasn't performed the release-engineering work of packaging a virus scanner. There are other tasks as well. We don't think that CVE consumers are looking for us to tag cases where a product lacks complete subsystem parity with all possible competitors.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
