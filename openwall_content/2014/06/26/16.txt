Security lines move, I would expect most modern system of any type (Windows, Linux, router, maybe not my bathroom scale that talks wifi... yet) to have some sort of firewall enabled by default and not simply leave everything exposed to the world. So in that case not having a fire enabled by default would definitely violate the principle of least surprise and maybe even qualify for a CVE.  - --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1 Comment: Using GnuPG with Thunderbird - http://www.enigmail.net/  2KHAU//lPwePVp/+qvsU =yV4Z -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
