You need a separate vulnerability to access the cookie.  These  vulnerabilities will have to be addressed even if the HttpOnly flag is  set because indirectly, they usually give attackers access to  information from which cookies are derived (e.g., by injecting a  malicious login form).  Therefore, I think the HttpOnly flag is just  hardening, and it's not even a very effective form of it.  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
