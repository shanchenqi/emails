The currently available exploit information is that an attack against versions to (inclusive) can use Zend_Pdf_ElementFactory_Proxy.  Also, an attack against versions to (inclusive) can use Zend_Http_Response_Stream.  The details of a successful attack are not identical for these two sets of versions. CVE's practice here is to assign two different IDs:    to Zend_Pdf_ElementFactory_Proxy =   to Zend_Http_Response_Stream =      The impacts are also different but a difference in impact does not, by itself, affect the number of CVE IDs. The detailed reason for why there are different sets of affected versions (e.g., a code change in to enforce use of certain PHP versions, with some PHP versions not allowing a malicious.php\0 filename) also does not affect the number of CVE IDs in this case.  Each CVE depends on the unserialize problem in the context of whether the version-enforcement code is present or absent.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =+ro7 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
