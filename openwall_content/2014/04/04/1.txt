Some seem to have already been handled, e.g. one of the most sever issues found is in gnutls (already fixed upstream). However, others seem unhandled.  Beside: It's well worth reading the paper if you're into that stuff.  cu, --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
