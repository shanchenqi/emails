Thanks.  Yes, we need this sort of confirmation.  My other concerns are:  I think Amazon has never participated in discussions on oss-security. Searching:  site:openwall.com "amazon.com"  finds only Anthony's request for distros list membership and some irrelevant pages outside of the oss-security archive.  It doesn't find any oss-security postings from any Amazon person (although checking the subscriber list I see that some were subscribed, at various times).  As I said in:   "Asking to join linux-distros before you've been on oss-security for a while (and preferably, having contributed to the discussions in here) is putting the cart before the horse."  The distros and linux-distros lists exist as an addition to oss-security.  It is pointless for a distro to be on distros/linux-distros while not also being on oss-security.  Granted, Anthony has just joined oss-security (welcome!), yet the sudden interest in advance notification while apparently not caring about timely notification (on just-made-public issues) just a week ago is suspicious.  Where's the info on Amazon Linux AMI security updates?  How timely were they, historically?  (In other words, does a few days of advance notice really make a difference?)  How are users being notified of them?  How are users supposed to install them?  I notice that Amazon was added to http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/vendors in  That's good, indicating some past interest in security notifications.  https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/security-bulletins/ lists security bulletins, including already on Heartbleed.  This addresses some of my questions above, yet I'd appreciate direct answers from Anthony as well.  We were not convinced about Qlustar being on linux-distros being worth the risk, so we never satisfied Roland's request.  If we're to satisfy Anthony's request and add Amazon to linux-distros, we need to clearly show how it meets a higher threshold.
