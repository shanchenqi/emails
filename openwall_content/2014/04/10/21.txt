I worked closely with Anthony when we were both employed by IBM. I know him very well in a work setting and also quite well outside of work.  I've spoken with him, face-to-face over dinner at LinuxCon/Plumbers [1], about his decision to leave IBM [2] and take a position at Amazon. I knew it involved EC2 but he could not divulge details at the time. I have absolutely no concerns about Anthony's request being devious in nature, especially considering that two other Amazon employees are saying that he's the right contact for the company.  I also think his knowledge of the Linux virtualization stack would be a great addition to the list.  I'll leave the discussion about if/when Amazon should gain access to the distros lists to others, but I do vouch for Anthony.
