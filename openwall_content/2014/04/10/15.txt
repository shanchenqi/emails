Use  For reference: this was apparently disputed internally by the vendor before a conclusion was reached that this is a vulnerability in the context of the vendor's security policy. Obviously an attacker who sends more authentication requests generates more system load. Apparently the decision is that it was a mistake for auth/controllers.py, when handling one request, to process superfluous data that had no real purpose other than increasing resource consumption.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =Ck8/ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
