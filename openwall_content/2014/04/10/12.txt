Thanks. >  > Yes, we need this sort of confirmation.  My other concerns are:  Matt commented earlier.  Max will also confirm.  Is that sufficient?  Between the three of us, there should be enough public evidence and enough people already on the list who have worked with one of us in the past.  > I think Amazon has never participated in discussions on > oss-security. Searching: >  > site:openwall.com "amazon.com"  We typically post to mailing lists from personal addresses due to DKIM.  I don't know if we have participated or not previously.  I have certainly participated in the past regarding QEMU security vulnerabilities but that would be with my previous employer and/or my personal address.  > finds only Anthony's request for distros list membership and some  > irrelevant pages outside of the oss-security archive.

That's a fair point.  We have other mechanisms to get security bulletins but more of our folks should subscribe to oss-security too (and that's why I'm subscribed now :-)).  > Where's the info on Amazon Linux AMI security updates?  http://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/security-bulletins/  > How timely were they, historically?  (In other words, does a few > days of advance notice really make a difference?)  A few days of advance notice enables us to respin our AMI instead of just providing a package update.  That's a big difference for our users.  > How are users being notified of them?  We use the page above, the MOTD in the actual AMI, and the RSS feed from the bulletin page.  > How are users supposed to install them?  Via yum.  We also auto-install critical updates on boot if the user chooses to enable that.  We also respin the AMI if the vulnerability is critical enough to ensure that new launches are patched.  > I notice that Amazon was added to  > http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/vendors in  That's > good, indicating some past interest in security notifications. >  > https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/security-bulletins/ lists  > security bulletins, including already on Heartbleed.
