Someone suggested not using self signed certs. Created RSA CA and DSA cert with g=1  $ openssl -text -in certg=1.pem G:    1 (0x1)  #server $openssl s_server -accept -cert ./certg=1.pem -key certg=1.key -CAfile ./cacert.pem -www  #client $ openssl s_client -connect -showcerts -CAfile cacert.pem Verify return code: 0 (ok)  Works in konqueror but not on firefox/nss for me.
