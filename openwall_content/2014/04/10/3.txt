You should receive this okay since you are on CC but I'm not sure everyone will get this through the mailing list.  If it doesn't make it, I'll send this same (signed) message via the @codemonkey.ws address.  I also added this address as a uid to my key.  Here it is again:  pub         Key fingerprint = EF0F BC30  1AAD E5FF uid                  Anthony Liguori <aliguori@...zon.com> uid                  Anthony Liguori <anthony@...emonkey.ws> sub    > I guess I'm wondering is this an official request on behalf of > Amazon or some random Amazon (employee? contractor?) asking for > access to distros@.  Yes, this is an official request on behalf of Amazon.  I am requesting access on behalf of the Amazon Linux AMI team[1].
