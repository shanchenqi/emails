Thanks.  Apologies for not having PGP set up for my work email.  I can confirm that Anthony is one of several correct people for dealing with security issues relating to Amazon Linux AMI. Cristian Gafton and I also deal with security issues, as we did in the Olden vendor-sec Days at Red Hat and rPath. I've added Mark Cox to CC: in case he'd like to weigh in on our backgrounds.  Max Spevack, previous Fedora Project leader and the manager in charge of Amazon Linux AMI, is also on Cc:.  Today we're just looking to get Anthony added to linux-distros as the primary contact.  --msw  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
