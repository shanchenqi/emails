For the record, we did see the mail around UTC, asked for details, but did not get a reply before the issue went public.  It's quite unfortunate distros weren't able to prepare packages before this went public, but this is the way it is sometimes.  I'd like to thank Huzaifa and Red Hat for attempting to coordinate updates by notifying other distros before the original CRD.
