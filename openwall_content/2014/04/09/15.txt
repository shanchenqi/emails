The PoCs we see send some malicous payload to servers and get some memory dumps. That doesn't affect clients?  Is this vulnerability exploitable by a Man-in-the-Middle in any way? Can someone send a package with a wrong authentication block inside an existing connection and therefore dump any memory from a client?  I think it's a very obvious question to be asked if we need to push all server users of openssl or ALL users of openssl. Because the latter would include Android. We are all pretty aware that android updates are in large parts nonexistent.  cu, --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
