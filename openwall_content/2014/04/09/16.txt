Yeah, anyone connecting to any TLS server using a libssl client is affected. Most web browsers actually don't use OpenSSL but rather nss, but other clients (like, for example, svn/git/etc., wget/curl etc.) are affected if they are linked against OpenSSL.  > I think it's a very obvious question to be asked if we need to push all > server users of openssl or ALL users of openssl.  All users, obviously.  People insist on server because that's the urgent problem. If NSS was vulnerable, it'd be really bad because it's pretty easy to trick any browser to open a connection to a random TLS website which would try to steal stuff from the browser memory (although sandboxing might help). For libssl clients though, I'm not sure it's that easy, but it's still possible.  > Because the latter > would include Android.

I don't have much clue about Android, but I think I heard heartbeat was disabled in Android, but I don't have a link right now. Also, I'm unsure what actually use libssl in Android and what uses NSS.
