This could cause an application linked to the json-c library, and that processes some specially-crafted JSON data, to use excessive amounts of CPU.  Reference:  2. json-c: buffer overflow if size_t is larger than int  The printbuf APIs used in the json-c library used ints for counting buffer lengths, which is inappropriate for 32bit architectures.  These functions need to be changed to using size_t if possible for sizes, or to be hardened against negative values if not.  This could be used to cause a denial of service in an application linked to the json-c library.  Reference:   Both these issues are fixed via the following upstream commit:    --  Huzaifa Sidhpurwala / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
