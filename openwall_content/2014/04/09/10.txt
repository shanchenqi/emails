We failed to reply in a timely fashion to that mail (but that's on us), but apparently so did Ubuntu, Suse sent a mail but got apparently no reply.  In any case, two days notice is a bit out of our comfort zone for preparing updates, but I think we would have managed to handle it properly if the embargo didn't break.  So again thanks Red Hat for notification/coordination job, but I'm still puzzled at what happened earlier, before Red Hat was informed.
