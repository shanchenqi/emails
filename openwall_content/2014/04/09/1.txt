Accordingly, only one CVE is possible at present. Use    Isode Ltd.           M-Link     Fixed in  We did not find any details about the change under the http://www.isode.com/products/m-link.html URL. (Also, the http://www.isode.com/evaluate/instant-messaging-xmpp.html page seems to imply that this is not open source.) Accordingly, only one CVE is possible at present. Use    lightwitch.org       Metronome  Fix in progress  Use for "Don't process deflated data if it exceedes the max allowed limit."  Use for "Don't allow to compress a stream if it's not authenticated."    Prosody              Prosody    Fixed in  Use for these changes that address resource consumption in general:      Use for this change that addresses decompression of unauthenticated data:    (This is exactly the same plugins/mod_compression.lua fix as in Metronome, and thus has the same CVE ID. Metronome was originally based on the Prosody codebase.)    Tigase               Tigase     Fixed in http://www.tigase.org/content/uncontrolled-resource-consumption-highly-compressed-xmpp-messages (not a public bug)  We did not determine that more than one issue was fixed. Accordingly, only one CVE is possible at present. Use    Erlang Solutions     MongooseIM Under Investigation  We did not find anything under the https://github.com/esl/MongooseIM/commits/master URL. There is apparently no publicly known vulnerability and thus no CVE assignment.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =U9OB -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
