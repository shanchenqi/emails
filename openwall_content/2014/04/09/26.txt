RBAC policies are not enforced when using the EC2 API, in particular the add_rules, remove_rules and destroy methods. A restricted user may overcome his limitation by using EC2 API resulting in unauthorized action on security groups. Only setups using non-default RBAC rules for Nova may be affected.  Juno (development branch) fix:  Icehouse (milestone-proposed branch) fix:  Havana fix:  Notes: This fix will be included in the icehouse-rc2 development milestone and in a future release.
