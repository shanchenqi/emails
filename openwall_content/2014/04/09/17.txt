Can anyone explain how an attack scenario would work? Is it like: * we have a Man-in-the-Middle. * Client/Server establish connection. * MitM inserts a malicious package with the heartbeat-payload and sends   it to the client, client parses package, verifying MAC fails, but it   still will output memory  Or is it ONLY an issue if we contact a malicious server that may extract random information from the application's memory?
