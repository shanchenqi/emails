Codenomicon definitely was:  Domain Name: HEARTBLEED.COM Creation Date: Registrant Name: Marko Laakso Registrant Organization: Codenomicon Oy  Jarkko Lamsa (@lampska), "Fuzzing and threat intel @codenomicon, martial arts", made some comments on Twitter:  <@lampska> @cynicalsecurity It was independent co-discovery. Plan was for responsible disclosure but it leaked (dunno where) forcing openssl go public  <_snagg> Wait, CloudFare fixed the OpenSSL bug 1week ago?somebody is getting the hang of this 'responsible disclosure' thing http://blog.cloudflare.com/staying-ahead-of-openssl-vulnerabilities <@lampska> @_snagg Independent co-discovery. Plan was a responsible disclosure, but it went public too soon http://www.heartbeat.com <@ysaw> @lampska @_snagg why did some get notified last week, but other didn't get notified until it went public? <@lampska> @ysaw @_snagg I do not have visibility to what happened there. I do know we had just started conversations with CERTs when this went public  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
