Paraphrasing their response: 1. Admitting \n is "expected behavior... not a bug"(!). Motivation: permits use of \n to separate arguments coming from the client. Mmm. 2. Better: the problem can be mitigated by quoting macro arguments in the server side configuration nrpe.cfg:  command[check_ssh]=/usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_ssh "$ARG1$"                                                        ^      ^  They agreed (March 21) to fix documentation and default/example configuration to contain "a better description" to this effect. That has not yet happened.  There's a lot I don't like here but I think quoting macro arguments in nrpe.cfg solves the immediate problem.  Martin.
