E.g with > openssl?  OpenSSL does not really care about host names, so you have to look at  the chain more or less manually.  I suspect it's okay to look at subject  alternative names of the end entity certificate exclusively if one  certificate in the chain has a name constraint.  The PKIX validation  code in OpenSSL should enforce the name constraints, and ignoring the  subject distinguished name should be sufficient to give these checks teeth.  It is, however, against the RFC.  The PKIX WG says that we should just  assume that CAs issue compliant certificates, which completely misses  the point of name constraints (at least what they mean to me, I expected  them to contain the impact of non-compliant CAs).  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
