We have not seen additional comments about whether \r would prevent an alternate attack approach. If it does, a separate CVE ID would be assigned. We do not know of a version of Bash in which \r separates commands in the same way that \n does. For example:    % /bin/bash -c "`echo -e "echo a\x0aecho b"`" | cat -v   a   b   % /bin/bash -c "`echo -e "echo a\x0decho b"`" | cat -v   a^Mecho b  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =Sg8i -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
