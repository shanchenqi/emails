The vulnerability was a stack-based buffer overflow, which could be triggered by a remote attacker sending a carefully crafted mail.  It was introduced by a Debian-specific patch, and the software looks dead upstream, so we issued from our pool.  The fix is only available in unstable [1] now, but stable and oldstable should follow soon.
