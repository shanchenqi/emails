In case a conditional jump is followed by a long jump,  conditional jump target is one byte past the start of target instruction.  A user/program could use this flaw to crash the kernel resulting in DoS, or  potentially escalate user privileges on a system to gain root access.  Upstream fix: -------------    ->  Introduced by: --------------    ->   Note: BPF JIT is disabled by default, must be enabled by the admin.
