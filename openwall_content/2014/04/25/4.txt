Codenomicon did find the bug independently. Codenomicon did not notify anyone else than us. We did not notify anyone else but OpenSSL. We did request a CVE for "a critical issue in OpenSSL" from CERT/CC but did not provide them any details at that time.

Maybe Codenomicon was, though. Jussi, could you confirm > that?  We received the vulnerability report from Codenomicon on Thursday the 3rd of April, at around EEST. AFAIK Codenomicon had found the vulnerability at around EEST on the same day, while developing new features to their test tools. We spent a few hours reproducing the issue, followed by a couple of days of work on the technical report and other preparatory material for the coordination effort, impact assessment, etc.  - -Jussi -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  hEzLxYuiTAnyVzzeU1Jx =y4kT -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
