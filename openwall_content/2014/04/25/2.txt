For comparison and for the record, Google web search for "Amazon Linux AMI" (in quotes) gives "About results", and the distinct results it displays are exhausted on page 16 with "In order to show you the most relevant results, we have omitted some entries very similar to the already displayed."  With the duplicates detection disabled, I am getting to "Page 52 of about results" until Google refuses to display more results.  It is unclear at first glance whether there are actually many duplicates within those 52 pages (vs. 16 pages) or not.  So perhaps that was not a very good check for either distro.  More important than these (unreliable) numbers of search results are the findings on actually relevant pages that I checked manually (I did check a handful for either distro).  Like I said, I couldn't find any users' discussions of Qlustar.  There are clear users' postings about Amazon Linux AMI among those web search results I saw.  Also, the three-word search query may have worse luck than the one-word "Qlustar", because many users would not bother to type all the three words (and consistently do it in the canonical way).  So I'd expect significant bias towards more "Qlustar" results if these distros had similar userbases.  For obvious reasons, a comparison against just "Amazon" would be differently unfair (and mostly irrelevant).
