Any volunteer(s)?  This sounds like a terrible job for a human but a simple job for a script.  I think all it really requires is having an agreed upon way to take disclosure dates.  It is then simple to have a script that (1) complains when (disclosure date - thread creation date) > max embargo period (2) complains when a disclosure date has been exceeded without an indication that there has been a public statement.  The nice thing about using on-list tagging is that it keeps all of the state on list such that anyone can run the bot on their own.  I would propose we use a system like:  X-Disclosure-Date:  To set/update the disclosure date for a given thread.  To indicate that something has been disclosed:  X-Disclosed-On:  I can watch threads for now and make sure metadata is getting tagged but hopefully over time all list members will participate making it not depend on one person.  If no one objects, I'll put something together and send out a pointer to the code.
