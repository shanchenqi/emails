Here's a summary:  Issue #1 (Before came out):  Marco Agnese discovered that Unity incorrectly handled entry activation on the lock screen, resulting in the lock screen crashing and the session becoming unlocked.  Reference:  Issue #2:  Giovanni Mellini discovered that Unity could display the Dash in certain conditions when the screen was locked. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to run commands, and unlock the current session.  Reference:  Issue #3:  FrĂŠdĂŠric Bardy discovered that Unity incorrectly filtered keyboard shortcuts when the screen was locked. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to run commands, and unlock the current session.  Reference:   Could CVEs please be assigned to these three issues?  Thanks!
