Yes, because it affects other similar correct programs that haven't yet been amended to work safely on your non-Unix system. ;-)  Alternatively, you may declare that your system is deliberately incapable of running programs written for traditional Unix safely, and will stay that way. That will be a reason for people to prefer other Linux distros over Red Hat's, but at least it'd be fair. ;-(  To paraphrase your question, since sendmail got a workaround for the old capabilities bug in the Linux kernel, does the bug in those old kernel versions still exist?  The answer is also yes, it does, potentially affecting other programs running on those vulnerable kernels.(*)  The bug needed to be fixed in the kernel, and it was (for later versions).  (*) Of course, most people should not actually run those old kernels because of other vulnerabilities that have been found and fixed since, but that's a separate matter.  I hope you don't mind the rhetoric.  I mean it to be friendly.  I hope it serves to deliver the message well.
