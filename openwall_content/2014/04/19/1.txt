It was found in software from GNUstep (www.gnustep.org), which develop an open-source development framework and runtime for client and server applications.  This is the first such request and the issue is (now) public; this message serves as an advisory as well.  Affected software: gdomap (GNUstep Distributed Objects nameserver) Description: After receiving a crafted invalid request, gdomap will attempt to log an error message to the system logger. However, due to incorrect setup of the logger during server initialization, the logger and gdomap itself will mess up program state enough that program execution will be aborted. gdomap listens to all interfaces, allowing a remote unauthenticated attacker to DOS the nameserver. (Please see the bug tracker entry for more detailed information.)
