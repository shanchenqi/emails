I put some details at: >  I do agree with the overall explanation but from that point on I don't think there is anything in openjpeg that would lead to a heap write before triggering a null pointer dereference or an OOB heap read. IIRC the latter being fixed in general by segfault4.patch, which ensures that all allocated heap memory is initialized.  > Anyway, this CVE is a dupe, MITRE could you please reject this CVE?  Well, depending on the above this specific bug might be split off - the original id covered bugs that could only be classified as leading to denial of service, nothing more.
