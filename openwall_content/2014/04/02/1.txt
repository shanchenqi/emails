Looking at the proposed patch (as the description is rather brief), it seems to me that it is a dup of one of the bugs covered by  Quoting from my post to oss-security: > 5. null pointer dereferences, division by zero, and anything that would just fit as DoS  > [listing the group of issues and attachments] > 5. > [...] > segfault6.patch  Which is exactly what is being commented about in [2], a copy of which is also available at [3].  IIRC without that patch some of the structures were not initialized and applications (like the ones shipped by openjpeg itself) would try to dereference NULL pointers, and just crash - no memory write was involved.  Or is there more into that I might be missing?  P.S. testing the encoding functions would probably be like opening another can of worms, if anyone is interested in that.
