The value passed into openid_error is passed through to the output without modification when openid.mode is “error”.  Example:   Here is the code at fault:  MyID.php Line   function error_mode () {   	isset($_REQUEST['openid_error'])    		? wrap_html($_REQUEST['openid_error'])   		:   }  MyID.php Line   function wrap_html ( $message ) {   	global $charset, $profile;    	header('Content-Type: text/html; charset=' . $charset);   	echo '<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"   <html>   <head>   <title>phpMyID</title>   <link rel="openid.server" href="' . $profile['req_url'] . '" />   <link rel="openid.delegate" href="' . $profile['idp_url'] . '" />   ' . implode("\n", $profile['opt_headers']) . '   <meta name="charset" content="' . $charset . '" />   <meta name="robots" content="noindex,nofollow" />   </head>   <body>   <p>' . $message . '</p>   </body>   </html>   ';    	exit(0);   }   Project Page: http://siege.org/phpmyid Code: https://www.siege.org/oss/phpMyID/trunk/MyID.php  The author has stated that the project is no longer maintained, so hasn’t been notified, and thus there is no fixed version. This is being submitted to raise awareness among those that use this application, and in hopes that a new maintainer will take the project over and address the outstanding issues.  --  Adam Caudill adam@...mcaudill.com http://adamcaudill.com/    Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
