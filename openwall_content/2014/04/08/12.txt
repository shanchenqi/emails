Well, as I put in my tentative timeline, and according to Jussi Eronen (from NCSC-FI, afaict) mail in that thread, NCSC-FI only reported to OpenSSL “a couple of hours before the advisory”, so my understand is that NCSC-FI was not aware of the vulnerability last week.  Maybe Codenomicon was, though. Jussi, could you confirm that? >  > 1) Mark J.

Ok the “Mark notifies^Winforms Red Hat” line and the “Huzaifa Sidhpurwala opens a bug” could actually be merged, they were more or less at the same time. >   > 3) At this point the plan was to embargo this until April 9th (I > forget what time), giving everyone 2+ days to deal with it.

Yeah, maybe the report by NCSC-FI to OpenSSL scared them.

Sure, thank you for starting that coordination as soon as you were made aware of the vulnerability (and sorry we weren't there monday morning UTC to help you on that).  I was more ranting about what happened and did not happened “last week”.
