Gets a CVE.  world readable log file, nothing sensitive in it? Hardening, no CVE.  Now what defines "Sensitive"? Some services MUST log sensitive information to be useful, e.g. WWW logs with the GET request which can contain form data passed via GET. Some will almost never log sensitive information unless placed into debug mode for example. So there is a huge grey are in the middle. This is offset by the occasional bug like "Service X log password under weird condition Y" which then makes that world readable log file a problem.  This also applies to configuration files, some are fine to be readable (/etc/passwd) and some are not fine to be readable (/etc/shadow).  - --  Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) PGP: A90B 66BF -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  iQIcBAEBAgAGBQJTRGCdAAoJEBYNRVNeJnmTlFkP/jAuknMtFwTALMrqDQjzsS6b =FFzl -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
