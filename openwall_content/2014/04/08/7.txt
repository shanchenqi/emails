We reported the issue to OpenSSL a couple of hours before the advisory was published. Our plan was to start notifications to distros and other vendors after discussing with OpenSSL. Codenomicon did mention us as the coordinator in the original text of heartbleed.com, but the current text reflects the situation quite well:  """ Who coordinates response to this vulnerability?  NCSC-FI took up the task of reaching out to the authors of OpenSSL, software, operating system and appliance vendors, which were potentially affected. However, this vulnerability was found and details released independently by others before this work was completed. Vendors should be notifying their users and service providers. Internet service providers should be notifying their end users where and when potential action is required.
