Whilst technically it was present in a Unity release, I cannot think of any other consumer of Unity than Ubuntu. As the exposed version of Ubuntu wasn't released, it would seem fair to consider the two together.  I am aware that on occasion CVE's have been issued for development snapshots, but I haven't seen clear policy on this.  I am not sure if this should be considered widely distributed or not. It would seem redundant to raise a CVE for inflight development snapshot. Unless, you believe the exposure to warrant it?  I'm sure someone from Ubuntu Security will chime in, but thought it wise to respond to avoid an ID being raised in potential error.  Thanks  -- Kind Regards, Dave Walker   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
