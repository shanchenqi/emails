The reference corresponds to part of fixed in July The reference is for March issues.  > SQL injection in graph_xport.php >  >   - Fixed form input validation problems >   - Fixed rrd export and graph shell escape issues >  >  That lib/rrd.php diff is part of the fix, but a possibly complete reference is:     where the graph_xport.php change was for SQL injection, and the lib/rrd.php change is related to addressing shell metacharacters with this approach:    http://php.net/manual/en/function.escapeshellcmd.php  We have not looked at whether that approach is sufficient. If it isn't, one more CVE ID would be needed.  The graph_xport.php change also introduces get_request_var in a few places. As far as we can tell, this is not a security fix. It is documented as "returns the current value of a PHP $_GET variable, optionally returning a default value if the request variable does not exist."  So, the new CVEs are:     = -      all of the changes to graph_xport.php to ensure that data is      numeric (reported as SQL injection fixes)     = -      all of the changes to lib/rrd.php to add cacti_escapeshellarg calls  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =ERTT -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
