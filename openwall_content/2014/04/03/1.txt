Two different products have been discussed:  1. KAuth 2. PolicyKit Library Qt Bindings (aka polkit-qt-1)  The discussion seems to suggest that the issue can't be properly fixed by changing only polkit-qt-1, and letting KAuth continue to use polkit-qt-1 in exactly the current way. Thus, the issue apparently should be considered a KAuth vulnerability, not a polkit-qt-1 vulnerability.  Also, based on the information provided in the post, a separate CVE ID is needed, not  Finally, there is apparently only one underlying problem in KAuth. The problem is restated in with an example, i.e.,    Consider org.kde.fontinst.service DBUS service, that is activated on   behalf of users request as a root service. It will therefore run with   uid 0, even if triggered by user. For now it is just using the pid of   user requesting the service. Thats racy and the thing we want to fix.  but this seems equivalent to the original problem statement in the post.  So, would it be best to assign one CVE ID now, even though the final approach to fixing the vulnerability is unknown?  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =WB0D -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
