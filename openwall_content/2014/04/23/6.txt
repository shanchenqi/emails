A CVE ID of was in the Subject line.  Also, there are two messages that discuss apparently distinct types of security issues, suggesting that two or more CVE IDs may be needed:    "The caller needs capabilities on the namespace being queried, not   on their own namespace. This is a security bug, although it likely   has only a minor impact." (The patch is in the packet_diag_dump   function in net/packet/diag.c, but the issue originally was in the   sock_diag_put_filterinfo function in net/core/sock_diag.c.)    "verify that the opener of the socket had the desired permissions as   well"  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =XHpW -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
