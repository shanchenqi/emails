When rebasing ontop of net this patch goes away.  I only addressed this issue at all because that was one of the capable calls that needed to be fixed for the second issue, and the permission check really did need to be moved to be correct from the dump context.  As the skb available in that function was the skb to write data into, not the skb of the netlink request we were authenticating.  >> >>   "verify that the opener of the socket had the desired permissions as >>   well" >> > > This is the proposed method of fixing  Yes.  The rest of the patches are just cleanups and infrastructure to allow that change to happen.
