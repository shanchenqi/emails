IMPACT ======  A buggy or malicious guest can crash the host.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Both 32- and 64-bit ARM systems are vulnerable from Xen 4.4 onward.  x86 systems are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  None.  NOTE REGARDING LACK OF EMBARGO ==============================  This bug was publicly reported on xen-devel, before it was appreciated that there was a security problem.  CREDITS =======  The initial bug was discovered by Thomas Leonard and the security aspect was diagnosed by Julien Grall.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.  xsa94.patch        xen-unstable, Xen 4.4.x  $ xsa94*.patch  xsa94.patch $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =BNcq -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment "xsa94.patch" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
