Was this not coordinated with the distros at all? If not, that seems like major fail on the reporters and NCSC-FI's part. :/  2c, ~reed  On Mon, 7 Apr Tomas Hoger <thoger@...hat.com> wrote:  > Hi! >  > There's a new OpenSSL release that fixes information leak issue: >  > > > http://heartbleed.com/ >  > --  > Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
