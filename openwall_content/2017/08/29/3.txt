Hi all.  In the last time there are some people that run afl for fuzzing...that's just  fine and great. Some people miss to communicate their findings to upstream and  request a CVE from mitre. However I'm noticing that every day there are new duplicates, let me post some  examples:  1) posted by on the redhat bugzilla, found by me months ago:  duplicate of:    The other recent examples here: http://i.imgur.com/q8g9SQi.png  2) Other duplicates are filed from qflb.wu which posts on full-disclosure. See about Some CVEs about lame was issued, also there are an high number of  vulnerabilities never confirmed by upstream nor posted on their bug tracking  system. Yes, sometimes I receive emails that say that the bug is not  reproducible but I'm always trying to help to reproduce. Instead some report  says: "If you want the poc please contact me at $email"  How to avoid to file duplicate? for the example number 1 just checking here: https://marc.info/?l=oss-security&w=2&r=1&s=JPC_NOMINALGAIN&q=b https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search/results? adv_search=false&form_type=basic&results_type=overview&search_type=all&query=JPC_NOMINALGAIN   Another strange thing, time ago I discovered an FPE in lame, which happens  only in the command-line tool:  After digging I discovered it was already reported by Brian Carpenter here: which says:  "fortunately, this is all in the frontend code in frontend/get_audio.c:parse_wave_header() and not in the library"  At the time I filed the CVE request I failed too see that it is not suitable  for a CVE, follow what mitre said about: "There is no CVE ID for this. Even if a web site runs the lame command-line tool, a divide-by-zero error does not have any availability impact for the web service, because the crash would occur in an independent process."  Great..fine..that was my bad, but months later we have: "There is a division-by-zero vulnerability in LAME caused by a  malformed input file." which points to: Fortunately the author shared the poc and the password.  I'm providing (http://i.imgur.com/GDWnHRM.png) a screenshot md5sum-included to  demonstrate that the issues are identically.   Does someone know: 1) How to avoid that CVE duplicates are issued? 2) Why the same issue was considered not-suitable and months later suitable  for a CVE?  --  Agostino Sarubbo Gentoo Linux Developer  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
