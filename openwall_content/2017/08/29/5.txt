There might be a CVE issued against a software version  distributed by Red Hat or Debian which is not applicable to the  upstream version.  Since each distribution patches their version it is  difficult to know the "product" that a particular CVE is applicable  to.  I agree that in my personal experience upstream maintainers are rarely  involved in the CVE process.
