Please see the CVE counting rules, it's a LOT more nuanced than "CVEs are issued against products". THe docs are at  https://cve.mitre.org/cve/editorial_policies/counting_rules.html  TL;DR: CNT1 comes into play and you get situations like libxml/gzip being embedded all over the place, but only a single CVE because 1) it's a single code based that's copied everywhere and 2) pragmatism.   > > I agree that in my personal experience upstream maintainers are rarely > involved in the CVE process.   Something I am trying to change. If you are an upstream and you want to become a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) for your project(s) please contact me.   > > > Bob > -- > Bob Friesenhahn > bfriesen@...ple.dallas.tx.us, http://www.simplesystems.org/users/bfriesen/ > GraphicsMagick Maintainer,    http://www.GraphicsMagick.org/ >    --   Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
