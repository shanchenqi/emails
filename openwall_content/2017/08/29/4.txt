Another recent example by which points to: There is an invalid free in the MagickFree function in magick/memory.c in  GraphicsMagick that will lead to a remote denial of service attack.   The maintainer of Graphicsmagick, Mr Bob Friesenhahn said to me:  "It looks like this problem is not a GM bug but it is already fixed in  libtiff.  Using latest libtiff CVS sources I see this in the GM traces  which are produced by libtiff:     Allocating scanline buffer of bytes    TIFF Warning: Discarding 89 bytes to avoid buffer overrun.    TIFF Warning: Discarding 16 bytes to avoid buffer overrun.    TIFF Warning: Discarding 1 bytes to avoid buffer overrun.    TIFF Warning: Terminating PackBitsDecode due to lack of data..    Not enough data for scanline 3. (PackBitsDecode)  I am not sure what libtiff Red Hat is using.  It may be that the  changes are since the latest libtiff release.  I could help with that  by making another libtiff release."  --  Agostino Sarubbo Gentoo Linux Developer  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
