From your side looks to be correct, What I'm trying to point out is to not  trust at all cve-requests that never went under upstream eyes.   >  > > months later we have: > > > > "There is a division-by-zero vulnerability in LAME caused by a > > malformed input file." >  > When we worked on your CVE ID request for the > > ader-get_audio-c/ report, we had the information about the affected > source-code pathname frontend/get_audio.c, and we had found the > information about "this is all in the > frontend code in frontend/get_audio.c:parse_wave_header() and not in > the library."

This is right from your side, but looks to be false in the reality. The cve  was issued on while the first comment from upstream was on  Again do not entirely  trust request that never went under upstream eyes.  > Yes box on our https://cveform.mitre.org web site.

As you can clearly see I'm trying to include the asan output on each bug I  find, to make it easily-comparable and sometimes you can easily understand the  cause/nature of the issue. Unfortunately people do not do the same and this  causes the presence of duplicates.   --  Agostino Sarubbo Gentoo Linux Developer  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
