This allows service impersonification:  This is a long-standing security flaw in kerberos, and i think it has probably been stumbled across by anyone who has tried to deploy a new kerberos environment.  (i know, because i did, many many years ago)  It's particularly bad that this is the default for new deployments because novices deploying a new kerberos domain are unlikely to deviate from the defaults out of fear of breaking something.  The result is that nearly every single krb5 deployment has this bug.  The band-aid needs to have been pulled off ages ago so that it's fixed for new deployments, and legacy deployments need to explicitly enable it if they need it.  Alas, I don't know how to make this transition happen smoothly :(  > Some deployments have implemented compatibility with > dns_canonicalize_hostname = false by moving the canonicalization to the > application instead, which is of course equally insecure:  Thanks for noticing these, Florian.  This is a disturbing trend: backflow of security flaws as they get fixed in one place for "compatibility" in another. :/        --dkg  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
