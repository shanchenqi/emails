I think this overstates the impact somewhat.  This is more worrisome with TLS because for most TLS applications there is a single global trust domain with certificates issued by dozens or hundreds of parties and no organizational scoping.  This is *not* the case for Kerberos.  To exploit this flaw in Kerberos, the attacker has to be able to control service principals (for the same target service with a different hostname) within the same Kerberos realm (or, in some circumstances, one reachable by cross-realm trust).  This is a much higher bar to meet, and in a lot of organizations this bar cannot be easily met by an attacker.  The attack is definitely possible, and the Kerberos community has been aware of this problem for a long time (there are a lot of difficult issues involved in closing it, but everyone has wanted to close it), but it's not as exploitable as the TLS equivalent (at least in the absence of organizational cert pinning).  > The Kerberos client library enables this canonicalization by default:  >        dns_canonicalize_hostname >               Indicate  whether  name lookups will >               be used  to  canonicalize  hostnames >               for  use in service principal names. >               Setting  this  flag  to  false   can >               improve    security    by   reducing >               reliance  on  DNS,  but  means  that >               short  hostnames will not be canoni‐ >               calized  to  fully-qualified   host‐ >               names.

For the record, those are settings for *a* Kerberos client library, not *the* Kerberos client library (specifically, the MIT Kerberos implementation).  Heimdal does not use those settings, and there are other Kerberos implementations as well.  --  Russ Allbery (eagle@...ie.org)              <http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/>  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
