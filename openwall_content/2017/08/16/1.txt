This allows service impersonification:     As a rule of thumb, the impact is similar to running TLS with CA-based certificate validation, but without host name checks (but perhaps slightly less because the trust domains could be much smaller).  The Kerberos client library enables this canonicalization by default:         dns_canonicalize_hostname               Indicate  whether  name lookups will               be used  to  canonicalize  hostnames               for  use in service principal names.               Setting  this  flag  to  false   can               improve    security    by   reducing               reliance  on  DNS,  but  means  that               short  hostnames will not be canoni‐               calized  to  fully-qualified   host‐               names.  The default value is true.         rdns   If this flag is true,  reverse  name               lookup  will  be used in addition to               forward name lookup to  canonicaliz‐               ing  hostnames  for  use  in service               principal names.  If  dns_canonical‐               ize_hostname  is  set to false, this               flag has  no  effect.   The  default               value is true.  Some deployments have implemented compatibility with dns_canonicalize_hostname = false by moving the canonicalization to the application instead, which is of course equally insecure:       Kerberos upstream does not want to enable secure behavior by default because of backwards compatibility concerns.
