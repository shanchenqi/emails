It is an open-source project from Spring.   -------------------------------- Vulnerable Payload -------------------------------- /files?path=<script>alert(42)</script>  -------------------------------- Mitigation / Recommendation -------------------------------- Understand that no patches will be published as product is going to EOL soon. The recommendation given by the vendor is to move off Spring Batch Admin onto Spring Cloud Data Flow going forward. I (discoverer) seconded the recommendation as it will no longer be supported, but if your organisation still require to use this application internally for some reason and does not want to deploy another product to replace it, you can consider entirely removing the file.php page if your team does not require to use it to upload new configurations often. Or implement a fix to sanitise the user controlled 'path' parameter value on the file.php page.   -------------------------------- Discovery Timeline (key events) -------------------------------- March - initial report submitted to Spring team May - Spring team shared that the stored xss issue might be fixed indirectly when fixing another issue on directory traversal, thus pending a full audit to confirm this. The CSRF issue is confirmed but it is low risk so they are still determining if they are going to fix it.  June - Spring team shared that the open source support policy for Spring Batch Admin states that Spring supports minor versions for 12 months and major version for 3 years. The last minor release of Spring Batch Admin was in with one patch release since. As a result, the team is reluctant to commit to something as intensive as a full audit for this application. July - Spring team shared that they do not plan to verify or fix the reported issues because they were planning to announce End-Of-Life (EOL) for this project soon. Also, they shared that "It is our recommendation to move off of Spring Batch Admin onto Spring Cloud Data Flow going forward".  Thank you.
