A data leak happens when these functions fill in sockaddr data structures used to export socket's diagnostic information. As a result up to bytes of the slab data could be leaked to a userspace.  Details: it is leaking exactly bytes of a kernel slab whenever we answer to a netlink request of type INET_DIAG_LOCALS or INET_DIAG_PEERS for a SCTP socket (e.g. sent by the 'ss' tool included in the 'iproute2' package with 'ss -Si' or 'ss -Sm').  A researcher of this flaw and a patch author is Stefano Brivio of the Red Hat.
