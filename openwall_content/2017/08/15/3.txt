ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The grant table code in Xen has a bespoke semi-lockfree allocator for recording grant mappings ("maptrack" entries).  This allocator has a race which allows the free list to be corrupted.  Specifically: the code for removing an entry from the free list, prior to use, assumes (without locking) that if inspecting head item shows that it is not the tail, it will continue to not be the tail of the list if it is later found to be still the head and removed with cmpxchg.  But the entry might have been removed and replaced, with the result that it might be the tail by then.  (The invariants for the semi-lockfree data structure were never formally documented.)  Additionally, a stolen entry is put on the free list with an incorrect link field, which will very likely corrupt the list.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest administrator can crash the host, and can probably escalate their privilege to that of the host.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen 4.6 and later are vulnerable.  Xen 4.5 and earlier are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  There is no mitigation for this vulnerability.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Ian Jackson of Citrix.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            xen-unstable, Xen 4.9.x       Xen 4.8.x, Xen 4.7.x, Xen 4.6.x  $    $  (The .meta file is a prototype machine-readable file for describing which patches are to be applied how.)  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.   (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
