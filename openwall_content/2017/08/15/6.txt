ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Xen maintains the _GTF_{read,writ}ing bits as appropriate, to inform the guest that a grant is in use.  A guest is expected not to modify the grant details while it is in use, whereas the guest is free to modify/reuse the grant entry when it is not in use.  Under some circumstances, Xen will clear the status bits too early, incorrectly informing the guest that the grant is no longer in use.  IMPACT ======  A guest may prematurely believe that a granted frame is safely private again, and reuse it in a way which contains sensitive information, while the domain on the far end of the grant is still using the grant.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All systems are vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  There are no mitigations.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            xen-unstable, 4.9, 4.8, 4.7, 4.6, 4.5  $   $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.   (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)  For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information, consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:   http://www.xenproject.org/security-policy.html   NOTE REGARDING SHORT EMBARGO ============================  This issue was discovered while investigating problems with the initial version of  Accordingly, is embargoed and the embargo will end at the same time as that of -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =x4fa -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
