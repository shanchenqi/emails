I can see that a "NULL pointer dereference" or a bug where the exploit has not been verified also get a CVE.   heap-overflows may or may not be exploitable.   It takes a lot of time to analyze the exploit and create the exploit code.   Is it right to be assigned a CVE only if it is exploitable?   Or do you think all bugs need to get a CVE?   Thanks.  ---  ref  ---  - NULL pointer dereference - memory allocation failure  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
