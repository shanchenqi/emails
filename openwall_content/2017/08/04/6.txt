Affected versions: All 1.x and 2.x Fixed in versions: N/A  At the moment, we do not have a way to patch this vulnerability from the code, so we advise administrators to secure their installations following our recommendation (i.e. deleting the 'admin' directory, disabling mysqli.allow_local_infile in php.ini). As a stopgap measure, we have improved documentation and added warnings in several places to better inform administrators of the risks they incur.
