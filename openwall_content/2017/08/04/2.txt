Another option it to notify a vendor such as Red Hat ( secalert@...hat.com) or SUSE (security@...e.com) as we can handle things in house (we have kernel devs/etc) and we know whom to notify at other vendors as needed (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu, etc.) and can hold embargoes as needed (although typically we don't like long embargoes either, I would say 4-5 weeks absolute max ideally).  Another benefit of notifying the vendors/distros is we can help with the coordination and notification, CVEs, etc. Kernel upstream basically just fixes it and moves on (which is legitimate, it's not their job to make sure every possible downstream gets notified*)  [*] although it would be nice if this stuff gets a CVE and the CVE gets used, then people know to pay attention to those commits/etc.   > > Thanks! > > [1] https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/security-bugs.html > > [2] http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros > > [3] http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security >    --   Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
