Hi,  I’m Yihan Lian, a security researcher of Qihoo GearTeam.  I found a vulnerability of  FFmpeg could be crashed when it is parsing a crafted mov file.  ======================== test command ========================= ffmpeg -c:v dnxhd -i poc.mov -y output.ts  ======================== crash info =========================== Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault. in ff_combine_frame next=-1, at              pc->state   = pc->state   << 8 | pc->buffer[pc->last_index + next]; Missing separate debuginfos, use: debuginfo-install  (gdb) bt #0  in ff_combine_frame next=-1, at  #1  in dnxhd_parse "", buf_size=-1)      at #2  in av_parser_parse2 "",      pos=0) at #3  in parse_packet stream_index=0) at #4  in read_frame_internal at #5  in avformat_find_stream_info at #6  in open_input_file "mov/input.mov") at  #7  in open_files "input", <open_input_file>) at  #8  in ffmpeg_parse_options (argc=7, at #9  in main (argc=7, at (gdb) p pc->buffer $1 = (uint8_t *) 0x0  We can see that the value of pc->buffer is NULL !!!   And I have sent this POC to HYPERLINK "mailto:cve-request@...re.org"cve-request@...re.org. They give me a CVE number.
