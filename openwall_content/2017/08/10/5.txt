However in between two send() calls, the append path can be switched from UFO to non-UFO one, which leads to a memory corruption.  In case UFO packet lengths exceeds MTU, copy = maxfraglen - skb->len becomes negative on the non-UFO path and the branch to allocate new skb is taken. This triggers fragmentation and computation of fraggap = skb_prev->len - maxfraglen. Fraggap can exceed MTU, causing copy = datalen - transhdrlen - fraggap to become negative. Subsequently skb_copy_and_csum_bits() writes out-of-bounds.  A similar issue is present in IPv6 code.  The bug was introduced in ("[IPv4/IPv6]: UFO Scatter-gather approach") on Oct 18  The fix has been submitted to netdev [1] and should be committed to mainline and to stable kernels soon. David has also sent an RFC series to remove UFO completely [2], which should be merged in  If unprivileged user namespaces are available, this bug can be exploited to gain root privileges. I'll share the details and the exploit in a few days.  Thanks!  ### Timeline  - Bug reported to security@...nel.org - Bug reported to linux-distros@ - Patch submitted to netdev - Announcement on oss-security@  ### Links  [1]  [2]  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
