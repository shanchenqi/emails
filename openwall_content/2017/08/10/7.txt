The bug is analogous to a previous one with PACKET_VERSION reported as The same analysis applies.  The bug requires CAP_NET_RAW to open a packet socket. This is a privileged operation, unless unprivileged user namespaces are enabled.  The fix has been submitted to netdev as    packet: fix tp_reserve race in packet_set_ring    Updates to tp_reserve can race with reads of the field in   packet_set_ring. Avoid this by holding the socket lock during   updates in setsockopt PACKET_RESERVE.    This bug was discovered by syzkaller.    Fixes: ("packet: add PACKET_RESERVE sockopt")   Reported-by: Andrey Konovalov <andreyknvl@...gle.com>   Signed-off-by: Willem de Bruijn <willemb@...gle.com>       Timeline:  - Bug reported to security@...nel.org - Bug reported to linux-distros@ - Patch submitted to netdev - Announcement on oss-security@  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
