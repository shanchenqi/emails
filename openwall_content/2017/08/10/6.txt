Thank you for providing additional detail, Vladis.  I'll add some more:  On Mon, Aug 07, at Vladis Dronov wrote: > As for the timeline as we understand it, we were notified about the flaw, we've discovered the flaw > being actually already fixed in the upstream, we've notified linux-distros@ and in a week we've made > this public announce.  For linux-distros, cases like this are a gray area.  On one hand, we state that the list is for non-public security issues only, and if anything already public is wrongly sent to that list then it should be posted to oss-security right away.  On the other hand, sometimes it happens that (at least) the reporter considers the issue semi-public rather than fully public - typically when public information about the issue is incomplete, relatively obscure, or/and is in a relatively obscure place.  Then it's sometimes tough to decide between insisting on immediate posting to oss-security or leaving distros some time to prepare updates before the issue turns from semi-public to fully public (if this is even a valid distinction, on which opinions vary). Sometimes the issue being semi-public results in a shorter (semi-)embargo period than what would normally be used for a similar issue that is considered fully private.  In this specific case, the issue itself was never sent to the linux-distros list itself.  Instead, Red Hat posted the following on July 26:  | we've been informed of a local privilege escalation issue in the Linux | kernel. has been assigned to this issue. The unembargo | date is set to August 3rd (Thursday next week) UTC. |   | For detailed information please email Vladis Dronov [1] |   |   [1] vdronov@...hat.com |        This kind of indirect disclosure is unusual, but it happens from time to time.  I did e-mail Vladis for the detail, and learned from the helpful reply that the issue was actually semi-public.  There was no discussion (that I am aware of) on whether this specific issue being semi-public required bringing it to oss-security earlier than initially proposed. Even if there were, it'd only affect the last one week out of two months.  We could insist that semi-public issues being brought to (linux-)distros be posted to oss-security right away, but this would result in distros who learn of such issues from elsewhere choosing not to inform their fellow distros, or at least not via the (linux-)distros list, as the distros would not want to make things worse for themselves and for most of their users (except for some advanced users, who could apply workarounds) by making issues fully public before updates are ready.  My reconstruction of the timeline is as follows:  postings to linux-fsdevel by Leilei Lin of Alibaba Group private Bug created in Red Hat Bugzilla (now public, edited) upstream fix notification to linux-distros posting to oss-security, full-disclosure, Bugtraq  Indeed, I am unhappy about a two-month timeline like this and about semi-public issues in general (the worst state an issue can be in), but I think the last week was actually the least problematic: multiple distros were finally aware and could work on fixes, still before the issue got widespread attention.
