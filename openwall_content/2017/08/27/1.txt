However, I don't expect the combined patch nor [2] to apply cleanly to FlightGear or earlier, because commit [3] introduced changes in the close vicinity of the changes in [2] (two conflicts). If you need to adapt [2] for such releases, just put the fgInitAllowedPaths() call after the one to Options::processOptions() in src/Main/fg_init.cxx[4] and src/Main/main.cxx[5], and you should be good.  I will probably backport the needed changes to a few of the last releases in the next days: see the FlightGear release branches at [6].  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] https://sourceforge.net/p/flightgear/flightgear/ref/next/branches/  Now here is the info for  [Suggested description] In FlightGear before version Main/logger.cxx in the FGLogger subsystem allows one to overwrite any file via a resource that affects the contents of the global Property Tree.  ------------------------------------------  [Additional Information] In FlightGear before version the FGLogger subsystem allows one to overwrite any file the user has write access to (with enough control over the contents to run arbitrary commands if the target file is then executed). A resource such as a malicious third-party aircraft or add-on could exploit this to damage files belonging to the user.  The security fix requires its parent commit to work correctly.  We are not aware of any malicious resource exploiting the problem.  The fix will be in FlightGear (expected in a few days).  ------------------------------------------  [Vulnerability Type] Incorrect Access Control  ------------------------------------------  [Vendor of Product] FlightGear (http://flightgear.org/)  ------------------------------------------  [Affected Product Code Base] FlightGear - Affected: releases earlier than (at least since version  ------------------------------------------  [Affected Component] source file: src/Main/logger.cxx in the FlightGear repository (https://sourceforge.net/p/flightgear/flightgear/ci/next/tree/src/Main/logger.cxx) executable: fgfs  ------------------------------------------  [Attack Type] Local  ------------------------------------------  [Impact Code execution] true  ------------------------------------------  [Impact Denial of Service] true  ------------------------------------------  [CVE Impact Other] Allows one to overwrite any file the user has write access to, and to control a significant part of the written contents. This leads to code execution using .bashrc and such.  ------------------------------------------  [Attack Vectors] Trick users into installing a resource that enables logging to a chosen file, via properties /logging/log/... For instance, a malicious third-party aircraft or add-on could do that (add-ons loaded via 'fgfs --addon=...').  ------------------------------------------  [Reference]  ------------------------------------------  [Has vendor confirmed or acknowledged the vulnerability?] true  ------------------------------------------  [Discoverer] wkitty42  --  Florent  View attachment of type "text/x-diff" bytes)  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
