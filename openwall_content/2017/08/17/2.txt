While i understand the desire to be clear about the constrained scope of the risk, i think another way of saying what you're saying is "control over one service in a domain and the ability to poison the DNS allows that service operator to masquerade as any other service in the domain".  Even for domains where a single administrator controls all machines, this violates principles of privilege separation that admins rely on to be able to deploy potentially-buggy services without putting the other services at risk.  So i think it's worth taking this seriously, despite(?) its age and widespread deployment.  > For the record, those are settings for *a* Kerberos client library, > not *the* Kerberos client library (specifically, the MIT Kerberos > implementation).

The fact that some client libraries *don't* do this should give us hope that it's fixable, even in existing deployments :)       --dkg   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
