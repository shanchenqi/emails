A patch created by David Lutterkort is available on the following PR:   Briefly, input strings ending with a whitespace char would be escaped (aug_escape_name) then incorrectly trimmed in parse_name, leading to a later loop stepping over the terminating NUL character.  Crashes in libvirtd were observed.  This issue was discovered by Han Han (Red Hat) through fuzzing with the Dice testing framework.   --  Doran Moppert Red Hat Product Security  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
