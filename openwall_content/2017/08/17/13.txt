Iâm aware that the link to the upstream website does not work. Iâm keeping it as well because in the future the upstream website could appear  again. Libfpx is not actively developed, I contacted the imagemagick project if they were available to patch security issues, but they said the they  are only accepting patches and push new releases. This issue was found using the gm command line tool of graphicsmagick.  The complete ASan output of the issue:  # gm identify $FILE AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address at pc bp sp READ of size 2 at thread T0     #0 in __interceptor_strlen     #1 in OLEStream::WriteVT_LPSTR(char*)     #2 in OLEPropertySection::Write()     #3 in OLEPropertySet::Commit()     #4 in PFlashPixFile::Commit()     #5 in PFlashPixFile::~PFlashPixFile()     #6 in PFlashPixFile::~PFlashPixFile()     #7 in PHierarchicalImage::~PHierarchicalImage()     #8 in PFileFlashPixIO::~PFileFlashPixIO()     #9 in PFlashPixImageView::~PFlashPixImageView()     #10 in PFlashPixImageView::~PFlashPixImageView()     #11 in FPX_CloseImage     #12 in ReadFPXImage     #13 in ReadImage     #14 in PingImage     #15 in IdentifyImageCommand     #16 in MagickCommand     #17 in GMCommandSingle     #18 in GMCommand     #19 in __libc_start_main     #20 in _init  is located 0 bytes to the right of 1-byte region allocated by thread T0 here:     #0 in malloc     #1 in operator new(unsigned long)  SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow in __interceptor_strlen Shadow bytes around the buggy address:   fa fa 01 fa fa fa 00 06 fa fa fd fa fa fa fd fa   fa fa fd fa fa fa 00 fa fa fa 00 05 fa fa fd fa   fa fa fd fa fa fa 00 00 fa fa 04 fa fa fa fd fd   fa fa fd fa fa fa fd fa fa fa fd fd fa fa fd fa   fa fa fd fa fa fa fd fd fa fa 01 fa fa fa 00 00 fa fa fd fa fa fa fd fa fa fa[01]fa fa fa fd fd   fa fa 00 00 fa fa 00 04 fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa Shadow byte legend (one shadow byte represents 8 application bytes):   Addressable:           00   Partially addressable: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07    Heap left redzone:       fa   Freed heap region:       fd   Stack left redzone:      f1   Stack mid redzone:       f2   Stack right redzone:     f3   Stack after return:      f5   Stack use after scope:   f8   Global redzone:          f9   Global init order:       f6   Poisoned by user:        f7   Container overflow:      fc   Array cookie:            ac   Intra object redzone:    bb   ASan internal:           fe   Left alloca redzone:     ca   Right alloca redzone:    cb  Affected version:  Fixed version: N/A  Commit fix: N/A  Credit: This bug was discovered by Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo.
