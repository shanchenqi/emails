I’m aware that the link to the upstream website does not work. I’m keeping it as well because in the future the upstream website could appear  again. Libfpx is not actively developed, I contacted the imagemagick project if they were available to patch security issues, but they said the they  are only accepting patches and push new releases. This issue was found using the gm command line tool of graphicsmagick.  The complete ASan output of the issue:  # gm identify $FILE AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address (pc bp sp T0) signal is caused by a READ memory access. address points to the zero page.     #0 in PFileFlashPixView::GetGlobalInfoProperty(unsigned int, OLEProperty**)     #1 in PFileFlashPixView::Init()     #2 in PFileFlashPixView::PFileFlashPixView(FicNom&, char const*, mode_Ouverture, unsigned int)     #3 in PFlashPixImageView::PFlashPixImageView(FicNom&, char const*, mode_Ouverture, long, PSearchHookObject*, FPXStatus*)     #4 in OpenImageByFilename(FicNom&, char const*, unsigned long, unsigned int*, unsigned int*, unsigned int*, unsigned int*, FPXColorspace*, PFlashPixImageView**)     #5 in FPX_OpenImageByFilename     #6 in ReadFPXImage     #7 in ReadImage     #8 in PingImage     #9 in IdentifyImageCommand     #10 in MagickCommand     #11 in GMCommandSingle     #12 in GMCommand     #13 in __libc_start_main     #14 in _init  AddressSanitizer can not provide additional info.
