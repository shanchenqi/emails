The problem can also be avoided by not using PID files at all, and relying instead on a service manager that actually keeps track of its children using more robust means (like wait() and SIGCHLD).  Even when a process isn't malicious, if it dies unexpectedly a different process may spawn re-using the PID stored in the pidfile, in an accidental collision.  At what point do we treat hacks like pidfiles as security risks more generally?  pidfiles, self-daemonization, privilege-dropping, are all things that are easy to get subtly wrong.  What do we need to offer to developers of daemons to encourage them to just stop doing them?    --dkg  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
