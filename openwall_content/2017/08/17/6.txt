ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  1) Code to handle copy operations on transitive grants has built in    retry logic, involving a function reinvoking itself with unchanged    parameters.  Such use assumes that the compiler would also translate    this to a so called "tail call" when generating machine code.    Empirically, this is not commonly the case, allowing for    theoretically unbounded nesting of such function calls.  2) The reference counting and locking discipline for transitive grants    is broken.  Concurrent use of the transitive grant can leak    references on the transitively-referenced grant.  IMPACT ======  A malicious or buggy guest may be able to crash Xen.  Privilege escalation and information leaks cannot be ruled out.  A malicious or buggy guest can leak references on grants it has been given, amounting to a DoS against the grantee.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All versions of Xen are vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  There is no known mitigation.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.  The security team would also like to thank Amazon for helping to identify that the problems with transitive grants were deeper than originally believed.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached pair of patches from the list below addresses this issue:      xen-unstable          Xen 4.9.x, Xen 4.8.x, Xen 4.7.x          Xen 4.6.x          Xen 4.5.x  Note that these patches have already been applied to the respective staging trees.  Alternatively, applying the appropriate attached patch from the list below works around this issue by disabling transitive grants by default:            xen-unstable, Xen 4.9.x, Xen 4.8.x       Xen 4.7.x       Xen 4.6.x       Xen 4.5.x  $             $  (The .meta file is a prototype machine-readable file for describing which patches are to be applied how.)  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.   (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
