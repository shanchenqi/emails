Miller" <davem@...emloft.net> Subject: Linux kernel: fixed bug in net/core/flow_dissector.c  Hello,  I was asked to investigate a suspicious kernel crash on some Linux server. It is at least a remote DoS (and maybe RCE): Linux is crashed by receiving a single special MPLS packet.  I bisected and found out that the bug was introduced in commit Author: Tom Herbert <tom@...bertland.com> Date:   Thu Jun 4  And was later fixed it in commit Author: Tom Herbert <tom@...bertland.com> Date:   Tue Sep 1  So currently the mainline kernel is not affected.  However, this fix is obfuscated and looks like unimportant code cleanup from the first glance. IMO that is not good. Moreover, the fix is a part of a branch which breaks the kernel build, so bisecting was not easy.  Actually the vulnerability is the usage of uninitialized variables. It is caused by returning true without setting values for n_proto, ip_proto and thoff in __skb_flow_dissect().  Is it worth requesting a CVE ID for that issue?
