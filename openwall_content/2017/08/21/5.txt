When dnsdist is configured to add EDNS Client Subnet to a query, the response may contain an EDNS0 OPT record that has to be removed before forwarding the response to the initial client. On a 32-bit system, the pointer arithmetic used when parsing the received response to remove that record might trigger an undefined behavior leading to a crash.  dnsdist up to and including is affected on 32-bit systems. dnsdist is not affected, dnsdist on 64-bit systems is not affected.  For those unable to upgrade to a new version, a minimal patch is available for  We would like to thank Guido Vranken for finding and subsequently reporting this issue.  - PowerDNS Security Advisory for dnsdist: Alteration of ACLs via API authentication bypass CVE: Date: Credit: Nixu Affects: dnsdist Not affected: dnsdist Severity: Low Impact: Access restriction bypass Exploit: This issue can be triggered by tricking an authenticated user into visiting a crafted website Risk of system compromise: No Solution: Upgrade to a non-affected version Workaround: Keep the API read-only (default) via setAPIWritable(false) An issue has been found in dnsdist in the API authentication mechanism. API methods should only be available to a user authenticated via an X-API-Key HTTP header, and not to a user authenticated on the webserver via Basic Authentication, but it was discovered by Nixu during a source code audit that dnsdist allows access to all API methods to both kind of users.  In the default configuration, the API does not provide access to more information than the webserver does, and therefore this issue has no security implication. However if the API is allowed to make configuration changes, via the setAPIWritable(true) option, this allows a remote unauthenticated user to trick an authenticated user into editing dnsdistâs ACLs by making him visit a crafted website containing a Cross-Site Request Forgery.  For those unable to upgrade to a new version, a minimal patch is available for  --  Remi Gacogne PowerDNS.COM BV - https://www.powerdns.com/    Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
