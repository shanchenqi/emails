We know that many of you selectively pick and choose changes which are added to current BIND releases for backporting to older BIND versions on which your distributed packages are based.  For those of you who do, we would like to make sure you have selected this change:  the built in managed keys to include the 			upcoming root KSK. [RT  and distributed it to users prior to the completion of the in-progress root key rollover in order to ensure that DNSSEC validation continues to work for operators who are using BIND's managed-keys functionality.  If you have any questions, you may contact us using security-officer@....org  Thank you,  Michael McNally ISC Security Officer  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
