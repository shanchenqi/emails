MBEDTLS_SSL_VERIFY_OPTIONAL. The issue could be > triggered remotely by both the client and server sides. >  > If the authentication mode, which can be set by the function > mbedtls_ssl_conf_authmode(), was set to 'required' eg. > MBEDTLS_SSL_VERIFY_REQUIRED which is the default, authentication would occur > normally as intended. >  > Impact > ------ > Depending on the platform, an attack exploiting this vulnerability could allow > successful impersonation of the intended peer and permit man-in-the-middle > attacks. >  > Resolution > ---------- > Affected users should upgrade to mbed TLS mbed TLS or mbed TLS > >  > Workaround > ---------- > Users should wherever possible upgrade to the newer version of mbed TLS. Where > this is not practical, users should consider if changing the authentication to > the 'required' mode MBEDTLS_SSL_VERIFY_REQUIRED is practical for their > application.
