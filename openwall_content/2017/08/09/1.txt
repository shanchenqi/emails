In the globbing function that parses the numerical range, there was an omission that made curl read a byte beyond the end of the URL if given a carefully crafted, or just wrongly written, URL. The URL is stored in a heap based buffer, so it could then be made to wrongly read something else instead of crashing.  An example of a URL that triggers the flaw would be  We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.  INFO ----  This flaw only affects the curl command line tool, not the libcurl library. The bug was introduced in commit August curl  For version the parser properly stops at the end of the string and a test has been added to verify this.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name to this issue.  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  - Affected versions: curl to and including - Not affected versions: curl < and >=  curl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such.  THE SOLUTION ------------  A [patch for is available.  RECOMMENDATIONS ---------------  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:    A - Upgrade curl to version    B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild  TIME LINE ---------  It was reported to the curl project on June 14,  We contacted distros@...nwall on August 1.  curl was released on August 9 coordinated with the publication of this advisory.  CREDITS -------  Reported by Brian Carpenter and Yongji Ouyang (independently of each other). Patch by Daniel Stenberg.
