Description: When a call-site passes a subject for an email that contains line-breaks, the caller can add arbitrary SMTP headers.  Mitigation: Users should upgrade to Commons Email 1.5. You can mitigate this vulnerability for older versions of Commons Email by stripping line-breaks from the subject before passing it to the setSubject(String) method.
