I need to recive syslog messages, filter them and send them forward to the SIEM.  Also HOST field is not represented in syslog, so i need to spoof IP of forwarding packets to bind messages recived by SIEM to it's original source IP.  If i will try to add some marks to syslog message, I will need to override parsers for each syslog source type, so it seems like abad idea.  Is there any open source tool for that task?   --  .
