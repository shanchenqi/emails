Options for The Alexander:    1.  Normal SIEM will work with syslog as it is widely supported format and will know where the log comes from by data source configuration.   2.  The "open source tool" is Perl, you can create any log format from any data sources and then send to SIEM.   3.  Talk to SIEM tech support. Good vendor will advise. If you do not have SIEM, buy LogRhythm. That should work. Freeware OSSIM I would bet will work with syslog as well.   4.  Alexander can email me mikhailutin@...mail.com for details.

Somehow we almost didn't have this sort of messages - someone seeking an open source security tool - sent in here so far.  Do we want them in here going forward?  The current list content guidelines do not address this possibility, as it certainly wasn't the purpose of the oss-security list so far.  Is there another mailing list where the above message would have been more appropriate?  http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security#list-content-guidelines mailing-lists:oss-security [OSS-Security]<http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security#list-content-guidelines> oss-security.openwall.org The purpose of the Open Source Security (oss-security) group is to encourage public discussion of security flaws, concepts, and practices in the Open Source community.    Meanwhile, please feel free to address the actual question about the tool.  (I don't know of such a tool.)
