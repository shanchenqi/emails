Really?  What kernel version are you looking at?  The latest kernel tree shows this, from the repo you link to above:    what am I missing here?  Also, any specific reason you sent this to oss-security just a few minutes after sending it to security@...nel.org?  I don't really care for something like this that is not really an issue, but if it was, well, you sure didn't give anyone a chance to actually fix it :)  thanks,  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
