It's - as the name says - a gpl licensed unpacker for old versions of the rar format. (The "original" unrar is not FOSS, as it contains a restricted license.)  It was hosted on gna [1], which got shut down recently. It hasn't been developed for a while.  unrar-free suffers from a trivial directory traversal vulnerability (poc attacked). I also found a stack overread and null pointer crash within a few minutes of running afl. In all likelyhood there are more issues. evince uses unrar-free if available and named like that for cbr files. Thus it adds more vulns like the recent issues with evince and comic book formats.  Given that it's no longer developed, has no active upstream and isn't very useful I'd recommend simply removing that package. It only supports very old rar files up to version 2, which aren't very common. When looking for a FOSS licensed rar unpacker: libarchive supports modern RAR files and is well maintained.  I'm maintaining the Gentoo package and I'm going to propose to remove it from Gentoo. (Unless someone steps in and takes up upstream maintainership of this package, which is probably unlikely.)  Issue 1: Directory Traversal  Creating a rar v2 archive with path names of the form ../[filename] will unpack them into the upper directory.   Issue 2: Stack overread  A malformed archive can cause a stack overread, detectable with asan. This issue doesn't happen reliably, I haven't investigated further.
