It can be used to gain kernel code execution from unprivileged processes.    Youâll find in attachment the proof of concept code and the kernel panic log.    #######   BUG DETAILS  ############    When a socket sock object is in DCCP_LISTEN  state and connect() system call is being called with AF_UNSPEC,  the dccp_disconnect() puts sock state into DCCP_CLOSED, and forgets to free dccps_hc_rx_ccid/dccps_hc_tx_ccid and assigns NULL to them,  then when we call connect() again with AF_INET6 sockaddr family, the sock object gets cloned via dccp_create_openreq_child() and returns a new sock object,  which holds references of dccps_hc_rx_ccid and dccps_hc_tx_ccid of the old sock object, and this leads to both the old and new sock objects can use the same memory.    #######   LINKS  ############        #######   CREDITS  ############    Mohamed Ghannam  Content of type "text/html" skipped  Download attachment "kasan_report.log" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  View attachment "poc.c" of type "text/x-csrc" bytes)  Download attachment "rip.log" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
