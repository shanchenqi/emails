Recently I was contacted by Tobias Stรถckmann who wrote a working exploit (on freebsd <- no aslr, thus easier) for one of those bugs in the FLIC parser. He also submitted a patch.  The bugs were ignored all the time, patches as well.  I reported a couple of more bugs and also contacted the GNOME security team. Some have patches, others not, ony one got handled. It seems overall the file format importers are unmaintained. I also tried to submit a fuzzing guide to the gimp wiki, which failed, because the people who are supposed to hand out user accounts don't answer. (gimp is not fuzzing friendly.)  The bugs:  Heap overflow in FLI import (the one where we have an exploit):  OOB read in TGA (with patch)  OOB read in XCF (patch, the only one that got merged and fixed)  OOB read in GBR (no patch, looks like string/utf8 issue)  Heap overflow in PSP (no patch, doesn't look straightforward to fix)  OOB read in PSP (no patch)   --  Hanno Bรถck https://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
