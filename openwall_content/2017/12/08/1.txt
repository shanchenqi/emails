It will go back to a single-binary architecture like gpg1 was, but move forward on just about every other issue:  * Written in C++ * based on the Botan crypto library instead of libgcrypt * typical library + CLI (with subcommands) architecture * better testing (CI, static analysis)  In the beginning, things will be somewhat unstable as I am cleaning up and restructuring the internals completely, but I try to keep every commit a somewhat running version (currently keyserver lookup is broken because I am not registering the root certificate of the keyserver CA - yes, openpgp keyservers have their own self-signed root CA).  You can follow the progress on neopg.io and the resources linked from there.  I am keen on documenting the changes and the reasons for them as I go along.  I am open to suggestions, just open an issue on GitHub.  Thanks, Marcus  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
