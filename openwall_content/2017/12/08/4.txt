It isn’t clear to me why using C++/Botan/CMake to give a “modern” feel (what does it mean?) will lead to “better” software (under which criteria?).  The multiple-process design in GnuPG had clear justifications AFAIK—e.g., having ‘dirmngr’ and ‘gnupg-agent’ in separate address spaces makes sense from a security standpoint.  Do you think these justifications no longer hold, or that the decisions were misguided?  I’m also skeptical about “better testing” bit: GnuPG and libgcrypt are among the first pieces of software that crypto and security researchers look at, and they’re also the first ones to get fixes when new attack scenarios are devised.  I’m sure you have a clear view on this but neopg.io doesn’t reflect that.  Thanks, Ludo’.
