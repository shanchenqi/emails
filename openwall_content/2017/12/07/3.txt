(1) test environment branch git log --oneline Merge branch 'linus' of git:// git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/herbert/crypto-2.6  (2)steps to reproduce 0. use the config file to compile linux kernel 1. gcc poc_timer_gettime.c -o poc_timer_gettime 2. ./poc_timer_gettime 3. crash can reproduce then.
