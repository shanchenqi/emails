This is something we ought to have an answer to, but I > currently don't.  Please see (Add support for the new GPG 2.1 "format") regarding this topic.  To summarize,  * Currently, gpg2john does not understand the "private-keys-v1.d" key   format.  * We have a very rough cracking implementation for "private-keys-v1.d"   key format at the moment. See "filter.c" on that GitHub issue.  I can start working on a proper native cracking implementation (with GPU support likely), if there is interest in this stuff.  -- Dhiru  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
