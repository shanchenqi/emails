The full security advisory can be found below and at  The issue is a parsing error while handling authoritative answers containing a CNAME of a different class than IN, leading to a recursor crash via a NULL-pointer dereference. We don't believe this crash to be exploitable, but it results in an unauthenticated remote denial of service which can be mitigated by running the recursor inside a supervisor like supervisord or systemd so it can be automatically restarted.  We also provide a minimal patch for the release at  Please feel free to contact me directly if you have any question.
