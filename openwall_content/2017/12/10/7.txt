Prior art to consider and inform your decisions:   * -- PGP Global Directory Verification Key    + Now part of Symantec; upload key, do verification steps via email,      get signature  * -- ct magazine -- pgpCA@...heise.de    + Some years back a German technical magazine apparently made a big      push to get people using OpenPGP and had their own verification      service  * WKS in the current (>= GnuPG releases, built with optional    ./configure flag, <https://wiki.gnupg.org/WKS>    + Software to be run by the mail-provider for a given domain, to act      as a trusted introducer and move away from the public keyservers.

Is one of the auto-key-locate options for GnuPG,      under name `wkd`.  KMail has built-in support  Good luck! -Phil  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
