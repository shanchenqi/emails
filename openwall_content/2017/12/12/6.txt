(Return Of Bleichenbacher's Oracle Threat)  https://robotattack.org/  It is mostly about proprietary appliances, but also affects three FOSS TLS stacks.  The attack is based on the fact that an attacker can distinguish valid and invalid RSA PKCS #1 v1.5 paddings based on different server responses.  Erlang  WolfSSL (only a pull req for now, no new release yet)  Bouncy Castle beta 9 contains the fix: https://downloads.bouncycastle.org/betas/  --  Hanno Bรถck https://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
