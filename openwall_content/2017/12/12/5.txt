Provide information for Xen branch in .meta.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Memory sharing, available to x86 HVM guests only, uses a special value in the global machine to physical address translation table (M2P).  PV guests have full control over M2P entries corresponding to pages they own.  A bug check (specifically, an assertion that an M2P entry is not the special "shared" indicator) was insufficiently qualified, and as a consequence is triggerable by PV guests in log-dirty mode (e.g. because of being live migrated).  IMPACT ======  A malicious or buggy PV guest may cause a hypervisor crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen versions 4.0 and later are affected.  Xen versions 3.4 and earlier are not affected.  Only x86 systems are vulnerable.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.  x86 HVM guests cannot exploit this vulnerability.  Only x86 PV guests can exploit this vulnerability, and only when being run in shadow mode.  PV guests are typically run in shadow mode for live migration, as well as for features like VM snapshot.  Note that save / restore does *not* use shadow mode, and so does not expose this vulnerability.  Some downstreams also  include a "non-live migration" feature, which also does not use shadow mode (and thus does not expose this vulnerability).  MITIGATION ==========  Running only HVM guests avoids the vulnerability.  Avoiding live migration of x86 PV guests also avoids the vulnerability.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            xen-unstable, Xen 4.9.x       Xen 4.8.x, Xen 4.7.x, Xen 4.6.x       Xen 4.5.x  $     $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
