The features you describe are a clear must for desktop/enduser usecases, that require frequent access to the key. It is clear to me, that those features are required, no discussion to this point.  The point in starting this thread was, that GnuPG does NOT conveniently cover usecases for headless or scripting operation. Thus it seems that the time has come to look for replacement, as GnuPG is moving more in the "desktop" direction, as also your comments indicate.  > >> Personally, I intend to stay with GnuPG 1 for now. > > > > As Debian marked the packages with "gnupg1 - GNU privacy guard - > > a PGP implementation (deprecated "classic" version)" I wanted to > > anticipate the changes now, giving me more time to evaluate the > > changes and to find alternatives when needed. >  > Hi!

That's really a strange argument. You fear PTRACING for key extraction of a short-lived, per-key instance of gpg1 process and solve that by putting all the key material into a single long-lived gpg-agent process, not even providing convenient commands to flush the keys from there? Hence not even PTRACING is needed, you can just access the socket to make the process give you the keys (directly or by requesting decrypts/signatures - I did not check on that).  Even with namespaces, PTRACE is still allowed unless you are running the agent as SUID-binary, causing other risks again. In my opinion, for server operation both schemes would not improve security the same way as on desktops: if the automated tasks is implemented to be run as root, PTRACE and namespaces do not help in any way. If run as distinct user, there are only two usecases:  * The service just does encryption/signature verification: here   the unavoidable agent just provides additional attack surface,   e.g. by replacing verification keys in the agent only, thus   everything looks nice on disk but your signature verification   is broken.  * The service does signing/decryption: the key is passwordless   (or password is within user-readable configuration) or HW-token.   In both cases, the initial security of the key material before   being transfered to gpg-agent only depends on file system level   access restrictions. Gaining access to UID or PTRACE is already   equivalent to full key material compromise. So also here the   agent only adds attack surface and that's it.  To reduce the attack surface, a "gpg --one-shot" argument could be added, which will terminate the agent immediately after use, maybe not even exposing it via sockets visible to other processes but only connected to its "parent" gpg process via pipes.  >  * gpg1 retains and provides backward compatibility for known-broken >    formats, like PGP-2, and will likely never effectively drop them... > ...  hd    Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
