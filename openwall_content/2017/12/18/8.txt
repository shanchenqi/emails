You are talking about policies here, not technical issues. Gnupg is perfectly scriptable, see pacman-key(1) tool in Arch Linux. Moreover, gpg-agent is easily usable on a headless machine. At least, I mostly use it this way when checking email... You will lose nothing if you just pkill(1) gpg-agent though. So I don't understand why you claim that gpg is moving towards desktop.  > That's really a strange argument.

Please read the manpages.  Cheers, --  Leonid Isaev  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
