Hi,  spotted by one of our customers...  shmctl(id, IPC_STAT, &buf)  returns the STAT information _only_ if the calling user has read-access to the "id" shared memory segment.  However, the proc entries in /proc/sysvipc/shm  return the entries for all users shared memory segments, even if there is no read permission.  There is a bit of information leakage in the access times, but I currently do not see any direct exploitability.  Regardless ... should the /proc/sysvipc/* files be restricted?
