The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * Jenkins (weekly) * Jenkins (LTS)  Descriptions of the vulnerabilities are below. Some more details,  severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  A race condition during Jenkins startup could result in the wrong order of execution of commands during initialization.  On Jenkins and newer, including LTS this could in rare cases (we estimate less than 20% of new instances) result in failure to initialize the setup wizard on the first startup. This resulted in multiple security-related settings not being set to their usual strict default. Affected instances need to be configured to restrict access.  Additionally, there's a very short window of time after startup during which Jenkins may no longer show the "Please wait while Jenkins is getting ready to work" message, but Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection may not yet be effective. As of publication of this advisory, we've been unable to confirm this can actually be exploited, but generally recommend that users upgrade their instances.
