Versions older than did not verify that the LDAP server's certificate matched the host it was supposed to be connecting to.  This has now been assigned by MITRE.  Older versions did not perform any kind of validation at all, but it was properly documented as such. Based on the changelog I believe this to have changed in by verifying the certificate's trust chain.
