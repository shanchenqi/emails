However, in spite of it providing advice on configuring it to "to setup LDAP over SSL/TLS"[1], the implementation does not verify the server's identity at all. I'm writing about it here mainly because there appears to be some intention of TLS support. Users might expect it to actually provide some kind of security. Interestingly enough, the documentation and the config file comments say 'the recommended [method] is "starttls".'[2] I don't know where they got that from. CC'ing SUSE's security team. I have not yet reported it to the portus team directly, nor requested a CVE id (though I'm tempted to request one, to err on the side of safety).
