"   It is possible for any local user to send SIGKILL to other processes with root   privileges.  To exploit this, the user must be able to perform su with a   successful login.  SIGKILL can only be sent to processes which were executed   after the su process.  It is not possible to send SIGKILL to processes which   were already running. "  Root cause of the flaw that a regular exit of the child process and the su ctrl-c kill of the child PID could race and so you would be able to later started process with this specific PID.  The fix is here:  Ciao, Marcus  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
