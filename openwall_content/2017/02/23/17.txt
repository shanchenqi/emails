These could be exploited by tricking a user into opening a malicious winmail.dat file.   Product Description ------------------- From the Readme.md: TNEF is a program for unpacking MIME attachments of type "application/ms-tnef". This is a Microsoft only attachment. Due to the proliferation of Microsoft Outlook and Exchange mail servers, more and more mail is encapsulated into this format. The TNEF program allows one to unpack the attachments which were encapsulated into the TNEF attachment. Thus alleviating the need to use Microsoft Outlook to view the attachment. TNEF is mainly tested and used on GNU/Linux and CYGWIN systems. It 'should' work on other UNIX and UNIX-like systems.    Integer Overflows in Memory Allocator ===================================== Severity Rating: High Vector: Local CVE: Not yet assigned CVSS Score: 7.0 CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H  Summary and Impact ------------------ Several Integer Overflows, which can lead to Heap Overflows have been identified in the functions, which wrap memory allocation.
