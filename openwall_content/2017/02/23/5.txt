I just reported this in Gentoo [1], yet I was informed that we're not using su from util-linux, but from shadow. So depending on the distribution you may not use this implementation of su.  I haven't digged deeper into this, can you say if this issue is generic enough to be expected in other implementations as well? (Not sure if the implementations of su in shadow and util-linux share a common codebase, seems to be quite old stuff.)
