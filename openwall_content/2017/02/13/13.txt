This?  https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/DWF-Database  Quoting:   IMPORTANT NOTE   There is a good chance this database (and indeed repo) will be phased  out in favor of the JSON database. If there is enough demand for it  there may be a CSV representation of all the data, but if there isn't  enough demand then we will simply drop it in So speak up if you  want/need this.  Is there a separate place for the JSON data?  Where?  --  Please *no* private Cc: on mailing lists and newsgroups Personal signed mail: please _encrypt_ and sign Don't clear-text sign: http://cr.yp.to/smtp/8bitmime.html  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
