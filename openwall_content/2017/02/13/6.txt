I have discovered this vulnerability and make a patch for this, though  not complete. When I send patch to fix this issue, I did know the Cirrus vga is not the default vga in qemu. So I  just treat this as a normal issue. But afterwards we discovered that the libvirt and xen use this vga as default. We tested a lot of cloud platform in China, every of them uses the Cirrus vga as default. Most of them is affected by this issue. The only one doesn't be affected I think have fixed this issue. So we think this issue should be got more attention. We  strongly commend every cloud platform treat this issue seriously. Though this vulnerability has been fixed for 10+ days, For responsible vulnerability disclosure, we will not public the PoC in this email. The PoC will be public later.  Thanks.  -- Li Qiang / the Gear Team, Qihoo Inc.   > -----Original Message----- > From: P J P [mailto:ppandit@...hat.com] > Sent: Wednesday, February 01, PM > To: oss security list > Cc: 李强 > Subject: Qemu: display: cirrus: oob access while doing bitblt > copy backward mode >  >    Hello, >  > Quick emulator(Qemu) built with the Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator support is > vulnerable to an out-of-bounds access issue.
