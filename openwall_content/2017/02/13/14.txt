As for the old tyle CSV representation of the data we'll probably do that as well since it is what people are used to consuming, but ideally we'll get the DWF data being imported into MITRE and processed fast enough that people can just consume MITRE's CSV feed (and resulting NVD feed and whatnot).  So for now I'm focusing on some back end things like the CVE Mentor process/CNA training, the JSON data format so MITRE can consume data and so on.
