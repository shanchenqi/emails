Also included proper (non-obscured) e-mail addresses from upstream patch.  Removed "possibly" from Impact.  3 patches updated  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  When doing bitblt copy backwards, qemu should negate the blit width. This avoids an oob access before the start of video memory.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest administrator can cause an out of bounds memory access, leading to information disclosure or privilege escalation.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Versions of qemu shipped with all Xen versions are vulnerable.  Xen systems running on x86 with HVM guests, with the qemu process running in dom0 are vulnerable.  Only guests provided with the "cirrus" emulated video card can exploit the vulnerability.  The non-default "stdvga" emulated video card is not vulnerable.  (With xl the emulated video card is controlled by the "stdvga=" and "vga=" domain configuration options.)  ARM systems are not vulnerable.  Systems using only PV guests are not vulnerable.  For VMs whose qemu process is running in a stub domain, a successful attacker will only gain the privileges of that stubdom, which should be only over the guest itself.  Both upstream-based versions of qemu (device_model_version="qemu-xen") and `traditional' qemu (device_model_version="qemu-xen-traditional") are vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only PV guests will avoid the issue.  Running HVM guests with the device model in a stubdomain will mitigate the issue.  Changing the video card emulation to stdvga (stdvga=1, vga="stdvga", in the xl domain configuration) will avoid the vulnerability.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.        mainline qemu, qemu-xen master,4.8   qemu-xen 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7       qemu-xen-traditional  $    $   NOTE REGARDING LACK OF EMBARGO ==============================  This issue has already been publicly disclosed. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
