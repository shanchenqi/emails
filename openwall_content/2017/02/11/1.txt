It's hard to see how this change doesn't completely cut the legs out from under this list... for those things which were sent here, and thus subject to discussion on the list (a lot of which in my simplistic world view has often been very useful), now in order to get any attention it has to go to a web form, and those submissions are immediately caught in the "embargo" net, and thus won't come here at all.
