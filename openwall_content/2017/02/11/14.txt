Hm... breaking thread should not happen... at least with non-broken  email clients. If everybody in discussion correctly set In-Reply-To  header then whole thread (correctly tree) will be preserved. And if  everybody correctly set References header then even missing emails does  not break threading visualization. Information from References headers  provide transitive closure of thread tree from which original tree can  be reconstructed... But if somebody does not fill References or In- Reply-To headers then thread will be broken independently of  subscription to list.  Now I see that message to which I replied was without In-Reply-To and  also without References headers. So thread was already broken.  I understand that breaking threading is bad and cause problems, but in  lot of times it is problem of broken email clients which do not fill  needed headers :-(  > So we'd appreciate it if you do subscribe to the list for the > duration of discussions you participate in, or at least explicitly > state when you're posting without being subscribed (ask to be CC'ed > on replies). >  > Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
