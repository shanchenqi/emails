For me the value of the oss-security mailing list to have a public mailing list which is read by all the relevant open source security stakeholders. Thats's why we're bringing all non-critical vulnerabilities reported privately to the Debian security team to the attention of this mailing list.  Having CVEs assigned is of lesser importance, this was never primarily why we posted security vulnerabilities here. Obtaining CVE IDs caused little overhead on our side, but if that changes (and the announced changes sound like that), then there will simply be less CVE coverage I'm afraid.
