In my perhaps limited experience, Debian package maintainers do not  take action to correct a security issue in stable distributions unless  a CVE is assigned.  They do not usually act merely based on the  upstream package developer/maintainer reporting that they discovered  and fixed a security issue.  If it is more challenging to get a CVE  assigned, then many more security issues in stable distributions will  remain unfixed.
