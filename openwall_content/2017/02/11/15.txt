Threads get broken when someone forwards an e-mail, rather than replies.  In a sense, I am at fault for forwarding you Simon's reply, instead of "replying" to his reply, over-quoting it, and CC'ing you on that.  I'd introduce an extra layer of quoting (unless I were to undo it prior to sending), but at least the References headers could have a chance of maintaining the thread.  2. The blists software we use for the official oss-security archives currently only uses In-Reply-To or one entry from References; it does not fully parse the References.  And fixing this in the code amounts to more than just parsing that header more fully.  What this means is that to maintain the thread I should have probably CC'ed you _and_ the list on that "reply" to Simon's message, where I'd merely quote the entire message for you.  That's not great indeed, but since Simon's message was such that I could reasonably have expected you wanting to reply to the list, maybe I should have done that.
