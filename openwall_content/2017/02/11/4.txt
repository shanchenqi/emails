This reply will hopefully answer all of the concerns so far. We are hearing 11 distinct concerns, listed below as C1 through C11, along with our responses of R1 through R11. If you have any ideas or suggestions for improvements to the CVE web form, we are completely open to this.   C1. What exactly has changed after MITRE's announcement?  R1. There are two changes. Each of the two changes is about the case where an oss-security participant is immediately ready to make a public disclosure, and wants an accompanying CVE ID. First, the person must visit https://cveform.mitre.org to make the CVE request (but can also send the vulnerability information to oss-security at the same time). Second, we would like a vulnerability description (i.e., a sentence or two about the product name, affected versions, problem type, impact, and attack methodology) so that we can publish the CVE on https://cve.mitre.org much more quickly. We recognize that, in a fraction of the cases (e.g., unanalyzed fuzzer results), a description would have very limited information.   C2. Can I still obtain a CVE ID if I'm not yet willing to disclose what the vulnerability is, and cannot offer any public reference URL?  R2. Yes, simply visit https://cveform.mitre.org and leave the "Reference(s)" box blank. Alternatively, you can enter a reference URL, and use the "Additional information" box to clarify that neither the reference nor the CVE should be public yet. This is not a change to how the oss-security list has be used. The oss-security list has always been about only public vulnerabilities.   C3. MITRE currently has documentation such as https://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html that recommends contacting DWF if an Open Source product does not appear on a certain list.  R3. In all cases where our documentation suggests contacting DWF, please use https://cveform.mitre.org instead at this time. DWF is currently ramping up their operations. CVE is covering all Open Source software. There is no list that is excluding anything.   C4. I have historically obtained CVE IDs from the CNA of a specific Linux distribution (e.g., Debian, Ubuntu, or Red Hat) and they are still willing to provide CVE IDs to me. May I continue?  R4. Yes.   C5. I want MITRE to send the https://cveform.mitre.org form data, and the CVE ID, to the oss-security list at the same time that these are sent to the requester.  R5. We have had internal discussions within MITRE about this. We are able to implement this easily if the community requires this approach. At the moment, we are expecting the requester to resend this information to oss-security once they accept their CVE ID assignment. Please see for an example.   C6. I want MITRE to send the https://cveform.mitre.org form data to the oss-security list as soon as that data is entered (i.e., before a CVE ID exists).  R6. We have had internal discussions within MITRE about this. We are not yet able to implement this easily. We may work on this if the community requires this approach. However, our understanding of CVE consumers is that they look to MITRE as a source of vulnerability information after a CVE ID number exists, not before.   C7. When using the https://cveform.mitre.org site, it is unclear what a "vendor" is, e.g., must it be the name of a Linux distribution?  R7. The vendor is the name of the upstream project or organization that maintains the Open Source software. If there isn't any project name or organization name, then the name of the software can be used as the vendor name.   C8. A CAPTCHA makes it difficult to do high-volume vulnerability reporting.  R8. We agree. The https://cveform.mitre.org use case is persons with low-volume reporting needs. We will announce other solutions for high-volume reporting. You can contact us, using the https://cveform.mitre.org "request type: Other" option, if you need a high-volume workaround now.   C9. I want to obtain CVE IDs faster in the future. Is there a plan for that?  R9. Yes, we anticipate that, in the future, hundreds of Open Source projects will become CNAs for their own vulnerabilities. This will be coordinated under DWF. In other words, an individual Open Source project will have a "sub-CNA" role. The initial documentation is on the https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/DWF-Documentation/blob/master/README.md web page.   C10. I do not want to use Google docs. Is there any other option?  R10. First, Google docs is applicable only to DWF, which is currently ramping up their operations, and is not a required entity for any CVE ID requests at present. Also, we do not expect that Google docs will be applicable to persons or organizations with a higher level of DWF participation, such as sub-CNA participation. At the higher levels, DWF currently uses GitHub, not Google docs.   C11. The https://cveform.mitre.org certificate chain is incomplete.  R11. Yes, we realize this and will be adding the missing item (Entrust Certification Authority - L1K) soon.
