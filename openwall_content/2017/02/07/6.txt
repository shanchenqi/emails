Thanks to a missing permission check, domain admins can delete aliases  they are not allowed to delete (for example abuse@, which the server  admin might have setup so that he gets all abuse mails).  This can only be exploited by authentificated domain admins.  See https://github.com/postfixadmin/postfixadmin/pull/23 for a detailed  description.  Affected versions: - PostfixAdmin 3.0 and - PostfixAdmin and (which actually are 3.0 beta releases)  Older PostfixAdmin releases (2.3.x and older) are not affected.  PostfixAdmin will fix this issue - I'll release it in the next days.   Regards,  Christian Boltz --  Immerwieder der gleiche Anfaengerfehler: /dev/null ist fuer Backup, /dev/zero ist fuer Restore.
