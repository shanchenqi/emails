These could be exploited by tricking a user into opening a malicious winmail.dat file.   Product Description ------------------- ytnef offers a library and utilities to extract the files from winmail.dat files. winmail.dat files are send by Microsoft Outlook when forwarding files via e-mail. The vendor was very responsive in providing a patched version.   Analysis -------- Due to the big amount of issues found no detailed analysis is given here. Almost all allocations were unchecked and out of bounds checks rarely performed in the code.  In total 9 patches were generated for the following issues:  1. Null Pointer Deref / calloc return value not checked 2. Infinite Loop / DoS 3. Buffer Overflow in version field 4. Out of Bound Reads 5. Integer Overflow 6. Invalid Write and Integer Overflow 7. Out of Bounds read 8. Out of Bounds read and write 9. Directory Traversal using the filename   To detail some of the findings, here are excerpts from the quickly written patch, which was send to the vendor:  Missing out of bounds checks:  	diff --git a/lib/ytnef.c b/lib/ytnef.c 	index 	--- a/lib/ytnef.c 	+++ b/lib/ytnef.c 	@@ @@ 	 #define MIN(x,y) (((x)<(y))?(x):(y)) 	  	#define ALLOCCHECK(x) { if(!x) { printf("Out of Memory\n"); exit(-1); } } 	 	+#define SIZECHECK(x) { if ((((char *)d - (char *)data) + x) >= size) {  printf("Corrupted file\n"); exit(-1); } }  	 void TNEFFillMapi(TNEFStruct *TNEF, BYTE *data, DWORD size, MAPIProps *p);  	void SetFlip(void); 	@@ @@ void TNEFFillMapi(TNEFStruct *TNEF, BYTE *data, DWORD size, MAPIProps *p) { 	       length = -1; 	       if (PROP_ID(mp->id) >= { 	         // Read the GUID 	+        SIZECHECK(16); 	         memcpy(&(mp->guid[0]), d, 16); 	         d += 16;  	+        SIZECHECK(4); 	         length = SwapDWord((BYTE*)d, 4);  Infinite Loop:  	diff --git a/lib/ytnef.c b/lib/ytnef.c 	index 	--- a/lib/ytnef.c 	+++ b/lib/ytnef.c 	@@ @@ void TNEFFillMapi(TNEFStruct *TNEF, BYTE *data, DWORD size, MAPIProps *p) { 	         memcpy(vl->data, d, vl->size); 	         d+=16; 	         break; 	+      default: 	+        printf("Bad file\n"); 	+        exit(-1); 	     } 	 	     switch (PROP_ID(mp->id)) {   Buffer Overflow:  	diff --git a/lib/tnef-types.h b/lib/tnef-types.h 	index 	--- a/lib/tnef-types.h 	+++ b/lib/tnef-types.h 	@@ @@ typedef struct {  	} TNEFMemInfo;  	 	 typedef struct { 	-  char version[10]; 	+  char version[16]; 	   variableLength from; 	   variableLength subject; 	   dtr dateSent;  Workarounds -----------  Update to version as released on https://github.com/yeraze/ytnef   About X41 D-Sec GmbH -------------------- X41 D-Sec is a provider of application security services.
