ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Certain internal state is set up, during domain construction, in preparation for possible pass-through device assignment.  On ARM and AMD V-i hardware this setup includes memory allocation.  On guest teardown, cleanup was erroneously only performed when the guest actually had a pass-through device assigned.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest may, by frequently rebooting over extended periods of time, run the system out of memory, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).  The leak is no more than 4kbytes per guest boot.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen versions 3.3 and later are affected.  ARM systems, and x86 AMD systems, are affected.  Intel systems, and systems without IOMMU/SMMU hardware, are unaffected.  All guest kinds can exploit this vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  Limiting the frequency with which a guest is able to reboot, will limit the memory leak.  Rebooting each host (after migrating its guests) periodically will reclaim the leaked space.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Oleksandr Tyshchenko of EPAM Systems.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            xen-unstable, Xen 4.8.x, Xen 4.7.x, Xen 4.6.x, Xen 4.5.x       Xen 4.4.x  $   $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches described above is permitted during the embargo, as is the mitigation of migrating a VM which has no devices assigned from IOMMU-capable hardware to IOMMU-incapable hardware, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  HOWEVER, moving a VM from AMD to Intel hardware, in response to this vulnerability, is *not* permitted.  This is because such a change is visible to guests, and would not normally be expected.  Furthermore: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.   (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
