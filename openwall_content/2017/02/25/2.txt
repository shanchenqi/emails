A fuzzing on tar and pax shows multiple crashes. I really donât know if atm those tools are used somewhere.  Details:  # tar -t -f $FILE runtime error: index out of bounds for type 'char SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: undefined-behavior in  /bins/tar: Record size of archive appears to be 14 blocks (20 expected) /bins/tar: Hmm, this doesn't look like a tar archive /bins/tar: Skipping to next file header  runtime error: member access within null pointer of type 'union block' SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: undefined-behavior in  runtime error: member access within null pointer of type 'struct sparse_header' SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: undefined-behavior in   ASAN:DEADLYSIGNAL ================================================================= AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address (pc bp sp T0) signal is caused by a READ memory access. address points to the zero page.     #0 in skip_extended_headers     #1 in list_archive     #2 in read_and     #3 in main     #4 in __libc_start_main     #5 in _start  AddressSanitizer can not provide additional info. SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: SEGV in skip_extended_headers  Reproducer:  Obviously, the runtime error âmember access within null pointerâ¦â is the ubsanâs way to print what asan subsequently said as SEGV, so it is the same issue.  # pax -f $FILE AddressSanitizer: global-buffer-overflow on address at pc bp sp READ of size 1 at thread T0     #0 in read_in_tar_header     #1 in read_in_header     #2 in process_copy_in     #3 in main     #4 in __libc_start_main     #5 in _start  Reproducer:  # pax -f $FILE AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address at pc bp sp READ of size 10 at thread T0     #0 in __interceptor_strcmp      #1 in process_copy_in     #2 in main     #3 in __libc_start_main     #4 in _start  Reproducer:  # pax -f $FILE runtime error: index 6 out of bounds for type 'char [6]'                                                                                                                       SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: undefined-behavior  AddressSanitizer: memcpy-param-overlap: memory ranges and overlap     #0 in __asan_memcpy     #1 in read_in_tar_header     #2 in read_in_header     #3 in process_copy_in     #4 in main     #5 in __libc_start_main     #6 in _start  Reproducer:  # pax -f $FILE AddressSanitizer: stack-buffer-overflow on address at pc bp sp READ of size 1 at thread T0     #0 in otoa     #1 in is_tar_header     #2 in read_in_header     #3 in process_copy_in     #4 in main     #5 in __libc_start_main     #6 in _start  Reproducer:  Affected version: 2.4h  Fixed version: N/A  Commit fix: N/A  Credit: These bugs were discovered by Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo.
