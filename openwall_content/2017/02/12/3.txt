Please clarify whether you want this added to the public CVE List immediately. You have provided as a public reference that appears to disclose this as a vulnerability, at least if the attacker can run a local application to make arbitrary system calls. The public reference does not directly suggest a remote attack: that detail could be omitted from the public CVE List.   > [Additional Information] > It's possible to cause a denial of server by sending bad IP options on a socket. > Potentially this can be triggered remotely. > > ------------------------------------------ > > [VulnerabilityType Other] > Denial of service > > ------------------------------------------ > > [Vendor of Product] > Linux kernel > > ------------------------------------------ > > [Affected Product Code Base] > Linux kernel - upstream > > ------------------------------------------ > > [Attack Type] > Remote > > ------------------------------------------ > > [Impact Denial of Service] > true > > ------------------------------------------ > > [Reference] > > > ------------------------------------------ > > [Has vendor confirmed or acknowledged the vulnerability?] > true  Use   - -- CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =Esbo -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
