As for the DWF it's simple: we're using git, so I guess if people really want up to the minute updates they can simply subscribe to the repos in GitHub, or pull and do it on their own end. I don't have plans for a notification service yet, on of my main goals it to make the data more easily available and then see what people need/do with it (and of course co-opt the useful ideas and use them!).  --   Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
