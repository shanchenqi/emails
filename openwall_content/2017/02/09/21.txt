The latest release was done ~5 years ago and the upstream bugs place seems to  be dead. However, I will forward them on their website.  I didn't receive any type of feedback from the maintainer so I don't know if  some of them are duplicates. In any case there are problems where the same codebase was used in more  places, e.g.:  shows a null ptr at: unzzipcat.c:94  and  shows a null ptr at: unzzipcat-mem.c:94  Both C file have the same code at line 94: printf ("%s\n", name);  So, while in the past, sometimes, we saw that one 'change' in the code was  able to fix more than one issue, in this case, the issue is the same but it  duplicate in more '.c' file  --  Agostino Sarubbo Gentoo Linux Developer  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
