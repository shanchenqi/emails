Last time I asked a MITRE employee about this as a result of the automated mail that oss-security sends out when it detects a CVE request, and I did not receive a reply.  So far I've only requested CVE IDs for projects that have no obvious CNA.  > which in turn instructs, "For open > source software products not listed below, request a CVE ID through > the Distributed Weakness Filing Project[1] CNA."

I try to avoid Google in my life as much as possible.  I'd rather avoid requesting a CVE ID, or let someone else do it, if that's the only remaining option for non-listed free software projects.  The oss-security list was a reasonably good solution for me.  The only disadvantage is that time passes between initial announcement and the CVE ID, because (AFAIK) a CVE request needs to contain a reference to the announcement as "proof" that the vulnerability is real and not a duplicate.  In an ideal world, free software project leaders should be able to request a CVE ID _before_ announcing a vulnerability to their user base.  If there were some way to register people as project leaders, the "proof" should not be necessary, they should be able to request a CVE ID with authority.  This delay between announcement and getting a CVE ID has always bothered me about CVE requests via oss-security.  On the other hand, I like the fact that there's a somewhat centralised place to watch for important and early(!) free software security information.
