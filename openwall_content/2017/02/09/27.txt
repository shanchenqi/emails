For instance:   will immediately exhaust the stack calling calc_eclosure_iter in the compilation. A small variation of this regex is:   will consume a very large amount of memory: it seems to eat 16GB in less than a minute. It is also possible to exhaust the stack memory trying to parse:  (((((((( ... repeated times  this issue is caused because regcomp will call the parse_expression, parse_branch and parse_reg_exp functions over and over again. Finally, the following regex will trigger an abort or invalid free when regexec is called:   I don't think these issues can be used to execute arbitrary code, but it seems quite easy to produce a DoS if a remote application is parsing untrusted regex expressions. In fact, we asked one of our students, AgustĂ­n Mista, to create a simple PoC to show how to crash a proFTP server if you can write a .ftpaccess file. You can find the script attached.  These issues were tested in GNU libc (Ubuntu and (ArchLinux).  I think it should affect the last version of GNU libc as well. Can someone confirm it?  I'm investigating how to submit these issues in the new CVE form...   Regards, Gustavo.
