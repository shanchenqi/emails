[...]  Agreed, having tried to figure out the form it seems geared toward requesting CVE IDs for vulnerabilities you've found in someone else's software, and not for maintainers of software to request CVE IDs for vulnerabilities which have been disclosed to them. The little detail callout icons for the vendor and product fields link to the CNA coverage list[0] which in turn instructs, "For open source software products not listed below, request a CVE ID through the Distributed Weakness Filing Project[1] CNA." So I guess that's what our project will be using in the future, or maybe just stop bothering to obtain CVEs on our own and let the various downstream redistributors of our software who are themselves CNAs issue them as needed and then fight over whose is the correct one.
