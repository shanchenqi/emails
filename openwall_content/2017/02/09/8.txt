Through this form, you can request a new | CVE ID, update a CVE ID that was already assigned, and submit | questions or feedback to the CVE Team. |  | We understand that oss-security is for vulnerabilities that should | have immediate public disclosure. You can continue to send details to | oss-security and propose that a CVE ID should exist. To actually | obtain the CVE ID, please also visit the web form at | <https://cveform.mitre.org/>.  Boy, a web form with captcha wouldn't be really efficient to obtain CVE-IDs.  Especially when there is huge influx of issues. It might help structure data  and automate, but for requesting CVEs, it's not really. :(  -- Prasad J Pandit / Red Hat Product Security Team 47AF CE69 54AA DD13 FE5B  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
