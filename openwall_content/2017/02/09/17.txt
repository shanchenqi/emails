A fuzz on it discovered an NULL pointer access.  The complete ASan output:  # unzzipcat-mem $FILE AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address (pc  bp sp T0) signal is caused by a READ memory access. address points to the zero page.     #0 in zzip_mem_entry_new /tmp/portage/dev-     #1 in zzip_mem_disk_load /tmp/portage/dev-     #2 in zzip_mem_disk_open /tmp/portage/dev-     #3 in main     #4 in __libc_start_main /var/tmp/portage/sys-     #5 in _init  AddressSanitizer can not provide additional info. SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: SEGV in zzip_mem_entry_new  also, the undefined behavior sanitizer says about:  # unzzipcat-mem $FILE runtime error: member access  within null pointer of type 'struct zzip_file_header'  Affected version:  Fixed version: N/A  Commit fix: N/A  Credit: This bug was discovered by Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo.
