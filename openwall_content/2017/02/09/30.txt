FWIW, glibc's policy seems to be that DoS via crafted regexp is not considered  a security problem: https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/Security%20Exceptions  "[...] resource exhaustion issues which can be triggered only with crafted  patterns (either during compilation or execution) are not treated as security  bugs. (This does not mean we do not intend to fix such issues as regular bugs  if possible.)  However, during execution, crashes, infinite loops, buffer overflows and  reading past buffers (read-only buffer overruns), memory leaks and other,  similar bugs should be treated as security vulnerabilities, assuming that the  pattern is trusted and reasonably structured."  --  Jakub Wilk  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
