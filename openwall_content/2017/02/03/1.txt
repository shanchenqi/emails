Since the mounting procedure is a privileged operation, an attacker is probably not able to trigger this vulnerability on the commandline. Instead the automatic mounting feature of the GUI via a crafted USB-device is required.  >From full disclosure at:   If it has been assigned elsewhere, I am unable to see it.
