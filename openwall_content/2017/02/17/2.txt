It could occur while stripping  VLAN header from 'eth_buf' buffer in receiving packets.  A remote user/process could use this issue to crash Qemu process resulting in  DoS.  Upstream patch: ---------------    ->  Reference: ----------    ->  Note:- It requires 'VLANSTRIP' feature to be enabled on the vmxnet3 device.   assigned via -> https://cveform.mitre.org/   Thank you. -- Prasad J Pandit / Red Hat Product Security Team 47AF CE69 54AA DD13 FE5B  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
