We apologize for the delayed response on this topic. The CVE Team has  been considering deeper details of how this could be implemented. The  advantage is that oss-security readers would obtain vulnerability  details faster. The main disadvantage is that it would discourage some  people from ever making CVE requests with public vulnerability  information, and thus might make the overall information flow worse.  The reasons it could discourage people include:    - At the time of their CVE request, they have a rough draft that     proves that a CVE should exist, but they haven't edited it for     full technical accuracy and/or spelling/grammar. They do not want     unedited text to be publicly attached to their name.    - People sometimes rely on their request remaining non-public, and     provide a great variety of information to us when requesting a CVE     ID for an already-disclosed vulnerability. They would need to     spend extra time on redactions, or MITRE would need to allocate     staff time to assess what part of the request seems non-public,     and redact it before making the oss-security post. Examples     include: (A) some people provide their work email address that     they don't ever use on public mailing lists, (B) some people     forward email threads with personal email addresses of the     vendor's PSIRT staff who responded to them, (C) some people     include non-public credentials for a demo site or a download of an     unreleased build with an experimental fix, (D) some people refer     to embargoed vulnerabilities when clarifying that they have a new     request that is different from related embargoed vulnerabilities.      In general, there's a common case (the requester only provides a basic technical outline of the vulnerability and the commit URL) where implementation is easy. There are several corner cases where implementation is hard. The simple solution is to always ask the requester to make their own (correctly threaded) oss-security post that contains any or all of the response from MITRE. Until we have a better understanding of why that simple solution is incorrect, we are continuing to go with that simple solution. Thus far, every https://cveform.mitre.org user (who we recognize as being an oss-security participant) has made their own subsequent oss-security post with at least the CVE ID. In other words, we haven't noticed a  problem at this point. We will continue to monitor open-source requests  for this situation and may reconsider this position if the problem  presents itself.  One final note: if the person declines to make their own oss-security post, this does NOT mean that the vulnerability becomes impossible to find. The CVE Team does publish entries on https://cve.mitre.org for these public vulnerabilities, and this may happen very quickly when the requester writes the description.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  4Jxus+DnasYSrVlsJ9Wq =VpXe -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
