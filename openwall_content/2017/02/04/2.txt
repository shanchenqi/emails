A fuzz on dumpelf an out of bounds read. It was reported to vapier which fixed  the issue immediately. Unfortunately I can’t get a symbolized ASan stacktrace, so I will show only  the useful part of both asan and gdb. This is not CVE-worthy because of the “READ of size 1” in a command-line tool.  I’m sharing it because some distro/packagers may want to have the patch  aboard.  # dumpelf $FILE unknown-crash on address at pc bp  sp READ of size 1 at thread T0  (gdb) #0  dump_notes (B=B@...ry=64,  at #1  in dump_phdr  phdr_cnt=phdr_cnt@...ry=5) at  #2  in dumpelf (file_cnt=0, filename=) at dumpelf.c:91 #3  parseargs argc=2) at #4  main (argc=2, at  Affected version:  Fixed version: N/A  Commit fix:  Credit: This bug was discovered by Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo.
