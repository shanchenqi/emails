A fuzz on scanelf exposed two invalid memory read. They was reported to vapier  which fixed the issue immediately. Unfortunately I canât get a symbolized ASan stacktrace, so I will show only  the useful part of both asan and gdb.  # dumpelf $FILE   SEGV on unknown address (pc bp  sp T0) signal is caused by a READ memory access.
