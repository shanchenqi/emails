The purpose of OVE IDs is literally only creating a unique identifier that no other maintainer or security researcher will be using to identify a different vulnerability. That's all they are. How you publish the vulnerability for which you have used the identifier is up to you.  They're slightly more readable and memorable than using /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid to allocate identifiers, and they give you some vague idea of how old the vulnerability report is. That's about the only difference.  (Hmm, now I'm tempted to use /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid next time I need a unique ID for a vulnerability that's already public...)  > P.S.: While we're at it, let's use the two OVEs I have just wasted, > (forward CVE web request+ID to oss-sec) > (add a title option field to OVE web form), > for the two aforementioned issues!  I'm pretty sure those aren't security vulnerabilities in any product :-P      S  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
