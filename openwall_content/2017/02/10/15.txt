Valuable insights might never surface unless every list  member manually monitors the database and decides to send a  message regarding a given database entry.  In short, it removes the best avenue toward the collaboration upon which all OSS development is based in the first place.  I don't mind if MITRE requires submitters to use their web stuff, but messages generated by that tool should also appear on this list, or something very valuable will be lost.  khm  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
