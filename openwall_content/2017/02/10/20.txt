I can assure you there is no  CVE-related bias whatsoever towards commercial software, or against  OSS.  Never has been any CVE-related bias against OSS, and I can't  imagine there ever will be.  I'm a big OSS fan and advocate, and although I will only speak for  myself, I'd be willing to bet that everybody else involved with the  CVE project is too.  As far as sending copies of CVE web form submissions to oss-sec, or  posting anywhere else, keep in mind that much of that info needs to  be embargoed until a vendor security advisory is published.
