Another part of the email from MITRE included "When you enter a vulnerability description on the web form, the CVE and description will typically be available on the NVD and CVE web sites at the same time or shortly after we email the CVE ID to you."  While the oss-security list has been the best resource of information for CVEs for us, part of our CVE ingestion is to download data from NVD and MITRE directly:  https://nvd.nist.gov/download https://cve.mitre.org/data/downloads/allitems.xml  Debian's database is also very useful to us: https://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/secure-testing/data/CVE/  And of course our database is freely available as well: https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security/ubuntu-cve-tracker/master  I hope this can help you adapt your processes as MITRE adapts theirs.
