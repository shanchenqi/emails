I'm helping Kurt with some DWF tasks and this CVE request showed up. I can't find a reference to a previous request for this issue, it's also very high profile and I'm told being exploited in the wild. I'm not seeing a previous request for the latest wordpress issue. I don't want an assignment request to wait until after the weekend.  It's #4 on the wordpress site:  I saw 1-3 had CVE IDs requested on January 27th.  Let's use for #4  Thanks.  --      JB   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
