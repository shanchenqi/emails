A fuzz on it with the UBSAN discovered a signed integer overflow. The upstream  project denies me to open a new ticket. So, Iâm unable to communicate with  them.  The complete UBSan output:  # podofopdfinfo $FILE /tmp/portage/app- runtime  error: signed integer overflow: + 9 cannot be represented  in type 'long'  Affected version:  Fixed version: N/A  Commit fix: N/A  Credit: This bug was discovered by Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo.
