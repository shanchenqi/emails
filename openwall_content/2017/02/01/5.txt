A fuzz on scanelf exposed an out-of bound read. It was reported to vapier  which fixed the issue immediately. Unfortunately I canât get a symbolized ASan stacktrace, so I will show only  the useful part of both asan and gdb.  # scanelf -s '*' -axetrnibSDIYZB $FILE AddressSanitizer: unknown-crash on address at  pc bp sp  READ of size 4 at thread T0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          #0      #1      #2      #3      #4      #5      #6    (gdb) bt #8  in scanelf_file_get_symtabs (elf=,  at #9  in scanelf_file_sym found_sym=) at  #10 scanelf_elfobj (elf=) at #11 in scanelf_elf "1.crashes",  fd=, len=) at #12 scanelf_fileat (dir_fd=, filename=, st_cache=) at #13 in scanelf_dirat (dir_fd=, path=) at #14 in scanelf_dir (path=) at #15 parseargs (argc=5, at #16 main (argc=5, argv=) at  Affected version: 1.2  Fixed version:  Commit fix:  Credit: This bug was discovered by Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo.
