A fuzz on it discovered a NULL pointer access. The upstream project denies me  to open a new ticket. So, Iâm unable to communicate with them.  The complete ASan output:  # podofopdfinfo $FILE AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address (pc  bp sp T0) signal is caused by a READ memory access. address points to the zero page.     #0 in PdfInfo::GuessFormat() /tmp/portage/app-     #1 in PdfInfo::OutputDocumentInfo(std::ostream&)  /tmp/portage/app-     #2 in main /tmp/portage/app-     #3 in __libc_start_main /var/tmp/portage/sys-     #4 in _start  AddressSanitizer can not provide additional info.
