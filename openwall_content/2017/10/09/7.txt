Some people don't consider this a problem, others do.  > Choose "Request an update to an existing CVE entry" and then for "Type of > update requested" choose "Update References" and then eneter the CVE #, > the ifo and URL and hit "Submit Request"  ... trust your browser's "sandbox" to work as advertised for a change and ignore the fact that you're running proprietary software that may or may not be customised just for your system and can't be easily audited in advance.  > TL;DR: Everyone wants the cat to wear a bell, and in past I'll admit we > (the CVE community) didn't make it easy to contribute. Well now we have > made it easy to contribute, so please do.  TL;DR: Not everyone wants to allow remote code execution just to request a CVE. Some people are sufficiently satisfied when security issues are found and fixed in time. While CVE number are sometimes nice to have, other identifiers work just as well (for some).
