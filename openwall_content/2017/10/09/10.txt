Description: Two four letter word commands “wchp/wchc” are CPU intensive and could cause spike of CPU utilization on ZooKeeper server if abused, which leads to the server unable to serve legitimate client requests. There is no known compromise which takes advantage of this vulnerability.  Mitigation: This affects ZooKeeper ensembles whose client port is publicly accessible, so it is recommended to protect ZooKeeper ensemble with firewall. Documentation has also been updated to clarify on this point. In addition, a patch is provided to disable "wchp/wchc” commands by default. - ZooKeeper 3.4.x users should upgrade to or apply the patch. - ZooKeeper 3.5.x users should upgrade to or apply the patch.
