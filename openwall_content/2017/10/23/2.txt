The following  plugin releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * Active Choices (uno-choice) Plugin 2.0 * Build-Publisher Plugin * Dependency Graph Viewer Plugin * global-build-stats Plugin 1.5 * Multijob Plugin  Additionally, we announce a vulnerability in SCP publisher plugin without fix.  Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you find security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  Active Choices plugin allowed users with Job/Configure permission to provide arbitrary HTML to be shown on the Build With Parameters page through the Active Choices Reactive Reference Parameter type. This could include, for example, arbitrary JavaScript.   SECURITY-50 Some URLs provided by global-build-stats plugin returned a JSON response  that contained request parameters. These responses had the  Content-Type: text/html, so could have been interpreted as HTML by clients, resulting in a potential reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability.  Additionally, some URLs provided by global-build-stats plugin that modify  data did not require POST requests to be sent, resulting in a potential  cross-site request forgery vulnerability.   SECURITY-57 Dependency Graph Viewer plugin did not perform permission checks for the  API endpoint that modifies the dependency graph, allowing anyone with  Overall/Read permission to modify this data.   SCP publisher plugin stores credentials to other Jenkins instances in the  file be.certipost.hudson.plugin.SCPRepositoryPublisher.xml in the Jenkins  master home directory. These credentials are stored unencrypted, allowing  anyone with local file system access to access them.  Additionally, the credentials are also transmitted in plain text as part  of the configuration form. This could result in exposure of the credentials  through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and  similar situations.   Build-Publisher plugin stores credentials to other Jenkins instances in the  file hudson.plugins.build_publisher.BuildPublisher.xml in the Jenkins  master home directory. These credentials were stored unencrypted, allowing  anyone with local file system access to access them.  Additionally, the credentials were also transmitted in plain text as part  of the configuration form. This could result in exposure of the API key  through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and  similar situations.   Multijob plugin did not check permissions in the Resume Build action,  allowing anyone with Job/Read permission to resume the build.
