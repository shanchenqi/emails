"It is possible that an attacker might use this to escalate his  privileges or execute code."  Upstream patch:   == == "The glob function in glob.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6)  before when invoked with GLOB_TILDE, could skip freeing allocated  memory when processing the ~ operator with a long user name, potentially  leading to a denial of service (memory leak)."
