I think it is in fact beneficial to question things and make sure people are on the same page as to what constitutes (or does not constitute) a security issue, and what exactly the issues are.  That said, please remember that your messages reach thousands of people and take up a tiny bit of each person's time - which adds up to way more time than you probably put into writing these messages.  Thus, you're expected to invest quite some time into reading and thinking of the replies you got so far before you post anything further.  To make this specific, please stop and re-read and think for 10 minutes before you possibly post anything else to this mailing list.  I feel that you posted the below without giving it enough time and thought first:  On Fri, Oct 20, at Robert Watson wrote: > Okay, so a script adds a symlink to /etc/shadow or something else > confidential.

I think this specific question had already been addressed by Ben in:   "There's stuff that will be protected by permissions (for example, you shouldn't be able to pull down /etc/shadow - so long as nginx/apache isn't running as root), but there are other files that you might consider sensitive(ish). Pulling down /etc/passwd would give you a list of known good usernames to better target brute-force attempts (for example). Or perhaps using it to grab the config file of some dynamic site on the same server etc."  When a thread starts going in circles like that, as a moderator I have to intervene and stop it.  So I do.  While we're at it, I also recommend that you avoid top-posting and over-quoting.  Here's how to format your messages better:  http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/anton/mail-news-errors.html http://www.netmeister.org/news/learn2quote.html  I don't find this message formatting aspect terribly important per se, but I may use it as yet another unreliable indicator of whether the person posting cares for other people's time or not.  If someone top-posts and quotes the previous message in its entirety on a mailing list (not in business correspondence, where this unfortunately became customary), chances are they didn't think much of what they're replying to and what they're posting as well.
