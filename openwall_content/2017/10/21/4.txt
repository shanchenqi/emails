(Unless the web server that will be serving the mirrored content is running as root, but don't do that.)  However, there are plenty of files on a system that are readable by the web server, but should not be readable by random people on the Internet. If the same web server has password-protected directories (for example using Apache .htaccess/.htpasswd) then the files with their passwords usually need to be readable by the web server, but should not be served.  /etc/passwd is another common example: it doesn't contain actual passwords since shadow passwords became widespread, but having a list of valid usernames available to the public would make life easier for an attacker, and should usually be avoided.      smcv  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
