Coy-paste from history:  RogĂŠrio Brito  - Don't include the debian directory as one that is needed during builds. Patch taken from Debian's packaging of lame.  - Resurrect Owen Taylor's code dated from to properly deal with GTK1. This was transplanted back from aclocal.m4 with a patch provided by Andres Mejia. This change makes it easy to regenerate autotools' files with a simple invocation of autoconf -vfi.  - Fix possible race condition causing build failures in libmp3lame. Discovered in automated builds by the Debian project with patch provided by Andres Mejia.  Robert Hegemann  - Improved detection of MPEG audio data in RIFF WAVE files. Tracker item [ ] Invalid sampling detection  - New switch --gain <decibel>, range to a more convenient way to apply Gain adjustment in decibels, than the use of --scale <factor>.  - Fix for tracker item [ ] Bug in path handling  - Fix for tracker item [ ] problem with Tag genre  - Fix for tracker item [ ] no progress indication with pipe input  - Fix for tracker item [ ] scale (empty) silent encode without warning  - Fix for tracker item [ ] environment variable LAMEOPT doesn't work anymore  - Fix for tracker item [ ] input file name displayed with wrong character encoding (on windows console with CP_UTF8)  - Fix for bug ticket [ ] Fix dereference NULL and Buffer not NULL terminated issues. Thanks to Surabhi Mishra  - Fix for bug ticket [ ] dereference of a null pointer possible in loop. Thanks to Renu Tyagi  - Fix for bug ticket [ ] Make sure functions with SSE instructions maintain their own properly aligned stack. Thanks to Fabian Greffrath  - Fix for bug ticket [ ] Multiple Stack and Heap Corruptions from Malicious File. Thanks to Gareth Evans and Elio Blanca  - Fix for bug ticket [ ] A division by zero vulnerability. Thanks to Wang Shiyang, Liu Bingchang  - Fix for bug ticket [ ] fill_buffer_resample function in libmp3lame/util.c heap-based buffer over-read and ap  - Fix for bug ticket [ ] fill_buffer_resample function in libmp3lame/util.c invalid memory read and application crash  - Fix for bug ticket [ ] unpack_read_samples function in frontend/get_audio.c invalid memory read and application crash  - Fix for bug ticket [ ] clip detect scale suggestion unaware of scale input value  - HIP decoder bug fixed: decoding mixed blocks of lower sample frequency Layer3 data resulted in internal buffer overflow (write).
