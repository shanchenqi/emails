Almost none of the so called script languages are interpreted.  They include a compiler, usually compile the input to some form of byte-code and executed it within a VM.  But that's just definition.  > Probably other programs use rsync without --safe-links when they should. > I didn't know the option existed until this thread was started (seriously, > rsync(1) is a HUGE manpage) so I'm grateful to the original reporter > for sending it along.  Raising awareness was one reason why I asked for a CVE id instead of just fixing it.  rsync, even if the protocol is really bad, is widly used to mirror all sorts of software.  It is also a generic tool, so the defaults are there to replicate the input as much as possible, not to be safe from problematic things.
