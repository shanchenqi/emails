The parser uses native deserialization on serialized Java objects embedded in MATLAB files. A malicious user could inject arbitrary code into a MATLAB file that would be executed when the object is deserialized.  This vulnerability was originally described at  Mitigation: Users are advised to upgrade to either Solr or Solr or Solr releases which have fixed this vulnerability.  Solr upgrades the jmatio parser to v1.2 and disables the Java deserialisation support to protect against this vulnerability.  Solr and Solr have upgraded the bundled Tika to  Once upgrade is complete, no other steps are required.  References: https://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrSecurity  --  Regards, Shalin Shekhar Mangar.
