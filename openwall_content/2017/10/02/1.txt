We’d love to have FFmpeg in-scope, but the simple reason is that they don’t reply to our e-mails. All projects participating must explicitly opt-in, and we can’t get anybody at FFmpeg to let us know their thoughts on if they would like to be added or not.  If somebody could help with that (or at least put us in contact with the appropriate folks), would appreciate it. :-)  ~reed (For the IBB)   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
