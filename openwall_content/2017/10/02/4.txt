It is found in several IP TV software images and hardware products including the commercial Dreambox devices.   A remote code injection vulnerability was found in the "key" HTTP GET parameter of the "/api/saveconfig" API call.  Further analysis of the vulnerability can be found here:  The vulnerability allows remote code execution on hosts running the aforementioned plugin. Some devices affected also run the plugin under root privileges (e.g: Dreambox HD se), allowing for complete remote takeover of the host.  This defect has been patched by the vendor with the git commit:  Administrators of affected devices are strongly advised to update their running instance of e2openplugin-OpenWebif to the latest version of the code. An official release containing the fix has not been released yet.
