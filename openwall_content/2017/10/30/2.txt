Thanks for publicizing this, it's an ancient issue, see e.g.   I think it may finally be fixed in the 2.x series of Magento which now has a "pub" directory beside "app" in the tree. With DocumentRoot = "pub", your local.xml should be safe.   > Magento protects against this by shipping an .htaccess file that blocks > access to that directory.

And since you mentioned Drupal, they've done the same thing in the past (search "code execution"):   What's worse is that the Drupal status report will warn you about the issue, but the "vulnerability check" that it does simply checks for the existence of an .htaccess! So if you're running nginx and if you have their impotent .htaccess file laying around, Drupal will tell you that everything's OK.  (And of course, if you fix the issue properly, the status report will tell you that you're vulnerable...)
