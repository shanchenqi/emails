I agree with much of this, and I think you're right that the  effectiveness of Clamav in mail filtering contexts can be debated,  though maybe more in terms of the AV debate, as you say.  As a user  myself with it deployed filtering multi-user domains, I agree that  detection rates are low.  However, checking just now on Github I do not get the impression at all  that development has stalled. Judging purely by number of commits, every  month there are consistently a very healthy number. But what has stalled  is stable releases; the last one being on 22nd April so  something is not quite right. But I've seen many open source/free  software projects stalled over the years and definitely Clamav does not,  IMO, fit that description (at least not yet).
