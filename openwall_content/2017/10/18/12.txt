There's stuff that will be protected by permissions (for example, you shouldn't be able to pull down /etc/shadow - so long as nginx/apache isn't running as root), but there are other files that you might consider sensitive(ish). Pulling down /etc/passwd would give you a list of known good usernames to better target brute-force attempts (for example). Or perhaps using it to grab the config file of some dynamic site on the same server etc.  So there is potential scope for abuse there, and others probably have better imaginations than I do.  The "nice" thing about it is: if an attacker gets access to the upstream mirror they still may not be able to mess with the packages themselves (as they're signed), but with this they can still potentially be hostile to downstream.   --  Ben Tasker https://www.bentasker.co.uk   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
