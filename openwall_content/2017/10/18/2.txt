ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  When dealing with the grant map space of add-to-physmap operations, ARM specific code recognizes a number of error conditions, but fails to release a lock being held on the respective exit paths.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest administrator can cause a denial of service. Specifically, prevent use of a physical CPU for an indefinite period of time.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen versions 4.4 and later are vulnerable.  Xen versions 4.3 and earlier are not vulnerable.  Only ARM systems are affected.  X86 systems are not affected.  MITIGATION ==========  On systems where the guest kernel is controlled by the host rather than guest administrator, running only kernels which only issue sane hypercalls will prevent untrusted guest users from exploiting this issue.  However untrusted guest administrators can still trigger it unless further steps are taken to prevent them from loading code into the kernel (e.g by disabling loadable modules etc) or from using other mechanisms which allow them to run code at kernel privilege.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Wei Liu of Citrix.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            xen-unstable       Xen 4.9.x, Xen 4.8.x       Xen 4.7.x       Xen 4.6.x       Xen 4.5.x  $       $  NOTE REGARDING LACK OF EMBARGO ==============================  The issue was discussed publicly before being recognized as a security issue. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =R0BH -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
