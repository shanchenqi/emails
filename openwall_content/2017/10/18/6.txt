ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Intercepted I/O operations may deal with less than a full machine word's worth of data.  While read paths had been the subject of earlier XSAs (and hence have been fixed), at least one write path was found where the data stored into an internal structure could contain bits from an uninitialized hypervisor stack slot.  A subsequent emulated read would then be able to retrieve these bits.  IMPACT ======  A malicious unprivileged x86 HVM guest may be able to obtain sensitive information from the host or other guests.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen versions are vulnerable.  Only x86 systems are affected.  ARM systems are not affected.  Only HVM guests can leverage this vulnerability.  PV guests cannot leverage this vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only PV guests will avoid this issue.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Roger Pau MonnĂŠ of Citrix.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            xen-unstable, Xen 4.9.x, Xen 4.8.x, Xen 4.7.x, Xen 4.6.x       Xen 4.5.x  $    $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)  For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information, consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:   http://www.xenproject.org/security-policy.html -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =v3zp -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
