I am not sure why > neither simply rejected the CVE.  Yeah, this one keeps trying to get re-introduced as a "fix", when it really isn't (see the archives of the stable@...r mailing list for details.  I don't know how you can "reject" a CVE, is there a proceedure somewhere?  There's lots of CVEs out there that people create against the kernel that just aren't issues at all, but I've been ignoring them as it makes people happy to assign and track them for no reason.  Is there some way a project can get them rejected?  thanks,  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
