Of course, a malicious user program could simultaneously manipulate the buffer, resulting in a non-terminated string being copied.  Bug report: Patch:  Please help assign a CVE to it.  Thanks, Meng   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
