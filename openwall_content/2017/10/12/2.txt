If a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) does not grant a CVE to an issue (whether it be due to "not a bug" or non responsiveness or whatever) there is a simple process to deal with this. You go to the CNA's parent, a list of CNA's is currently at:  https://cve.mitre.org/cve/cna.html  in general most current CNA's have MITRE as their parent (we're working on a federated hierarchy but we're in the early stages), so using the form:  https://cveform.mitre.org/  to request a CVE would be your next step. For the Open Source Distributed Weakness Filing (DWF) hierarchy each CNA and sub CNA is registered at:  https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/DWF-CNA-Registry/tree/master/CNA-Registry   so essentially you go to the parent and keep working your way up until either you are satisfied, or you hit MITRE and they tell you to take a hike, or give you a CVE.  Speaking of which if you are an Open Source project and want to be a CNA, polease contact me and chances are I can set you up in a pretty quick timeframe (faster than I assign CVEs because creating a CNA is a much better ROI of my time than issuing a CVE). .  --   Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
