ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The architecture allows interrupts to be run on distinct stacks. The choice of stack is encoded in a field of the corresponding interrupt descriptor in the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT).  That field selects an entry from the active Task State Segment (TSS).  Since, on AMD hardware, Xen switches to an HVM guest's TSS before actually entering the guest, with the Global Interrupt Flag still set, the selectors in the IDT entry are switched when guest context is loaded/unloaded.  When a new CPU is brought online, its IDT is copied from CPU0's IDT, including those selector fields.  If CPU0 happens at that moment to be in HVM context, wrong values for those IDT fields would be installed for the new CPU.  If the first guest vCPU to be run on that CPU belongs to a PV guest, it will then have the ability to escalate its privilege or crash the hypervisor.  IMPACT ======  A malicious or buggy x86 PV guest could escalate its privileges or crash the hypervisor.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen versions from at least 3.2 onwards are vulnerable.  Earlier versions have not been checked.  Only PV guests can exploit the vulnerability.  HVM guests cannot exploit the vulnerability, but their presence is necessary for the exposure of the vulnerability to PV guests.  Only x86 systems using SVM (AMD virtualisation extensions) rather than VMX (Intel virtualisation extensions) are vulnerable.  Therefore AMD x86 hardware is vulnerable; Intel hardware is not vulnerable.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  Avoiding to online CPUs at runtime will avoid this vulnerability.  Running only HVM or only PV guests on any individual host will also avoid this vulnerability.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Andrew Cooper of Citrix.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            xen-unstable, Xen 4.9.x, Xen 4.8.x       Xen 4.7.x       Xen 4.6.x       Xen 4.5.x  $      $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
