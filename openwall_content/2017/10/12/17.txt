It could occur while traversing guest page table  entries to resolve guest virtual address(gva).  A L1 guest could use this flaw to crash the host kernel resulting in DoS. OR  potentially execute arbitrary code on the host to gain access to the host  system.  Upstream patch: ---------------    ->  Reference: ----------    ->  assigned by Red Hat Inc.
