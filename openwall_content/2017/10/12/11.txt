Public release.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  x86 PV guests effect TLB flushes by way of a hypercall.  Xen tries to reduce the number of TLB flushes by delaying them as much as possible. When the last type reference of a page is dropped, the need for a TLB flush (before the page is re-used) is recorded.  If a guest TLB flush request involves an Inter Processor Interrupt (IPI) to a CPU in which is the process of dropping the last type reference of some page, and if that IPI arrives at exactly the right instruction boundary, a stale time stamp may be recorded, possibly resulting in the later omission of the necessary TLB flush for that page.  IMPACT ======  A malicious x86 PV guest may be able to access all of system memory, allowing for all of privilege escalation, host crashes, and information leaks.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen versions from at least 3.2 onwards are vulnerable.  Earlier versions have not been checked.  Only x86 systems are affected.  ARM systems are not affected.  Only x86 PV guests can leverage the vulnerability.  x86 HVM guests cannot leverage the vulnerability.  RISK ASSESSMENT ===============  A successful attack would require introducing an extended delay between two adjacent operations on one cpu -- long enough for two hypercalls to complete on another cpu.  The security team currently has no proof-of-concept for this vulnerability.  However, techniques for these sorts of timing-based attacks are continually advancing, so we still recommend users potentially affected by this issue apply the patch as soon as reasonably possible.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only HVM guests will avoid this vulnerability.  For PV guests, the vulnerability can be avoided if the guest kernel is controlled by the host rather than guest administrator, provided that further steps are taken to prevent the guest administrator from loading code into the kernel (e.g. by disabling loadable modules etc) or from using other mechanisms which allow them to run code at kernel privilege.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Jann Horn of Google Project Zero.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            xen-unstable       Xen 4.9.x       Xen 4.8.x, Xen 4.7.x, Xen 4.6.x, Xen 4.5.x  $     $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
