Trying to KEYTCL_READ on negative key would lead to a NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could use this flaw to crash the kernel.  It looks as though the read primitive is limited to a fixed address so this has very limited use as an arbitrary read primitive to leverage for another exploit.
