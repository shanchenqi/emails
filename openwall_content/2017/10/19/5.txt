Earlier versions are also affected.  When an application makes a request via getaddrinfo for both IPv4 and IPv6 results (AF_UNSPEC), an attacker who controls or can spoof the nameservers configured in resolv.conf can reply to both the A and AAAA queries with A results. Since A records are smaller than AAAA records, it's possible to fit more addresses than the precomputed bound, and a buffer overflow occurs.  Users are advised to upgrade to or patch; the patch is simple and should apply cleanly to all recent versions:   Users who cannot patch or upgrade immediately can mitigate the issue by running a caching nameserver on localhost and pointing resolv.conf to  Rich  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
