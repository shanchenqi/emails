Been programming Unix/Linux for 30 years but now need to be a real SysAdmin so need to correct my misconceptions.  Removing the ability for rsync to copy symlinks pointing to targets outside the mirror tree would greatly cripple it. I need to understand how the danger is worth the loss of this functionality.  Can you or anyone help me with this?      *Trust in truth keeps hope aliverobertcwatson1@...il.com <robertcwatson1@...il.com>webmaster@...icchorale.org <webmaster@...icchorale.org>alpha.docsalvager.info <http://alpha.docsalvager.info>www.CivicChorale.org <http://www.CivicChorale.org>*  On Wed, Oct 18, at AM, Ben Tasker <ben@...tasker.co.uk> wrote:  > On Wed, Oct 18, at PM, Robert Watson <robertcwatson1@...il.com> > wrote: > > > Since security is determined by file and directory permissions and > > ownership, not by symlinks, wouldn't the fact that a malicious user did > not > > have permissions to access the symlink's target file/directory prevent > any > > harm? > > > > If I'm reading the original correctly, then the user that will access the > target will be the user your HTTP daemon runs as (so, for sake of example, > nginx). > > There's stuff that will be protected by permissions (for example, you > shouldn't be able to pull down /etc/shadow - so long as nginx/apache isn't > running as root), but there are other files that you might consider > sensitive(ish).
