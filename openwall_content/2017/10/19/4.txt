Note that the fix isn't modifying rsync, the fix is modifying the ftpsync script that calls rsync:  +    --safe-links --timeout --stats --no-human-readable"}   Of course for people who run this mirroring tool as a specific user account and set file permissions appropriately this is more or less a no-op. But this is a useful hardening for people who run the ftpsync command as a user with too many privileges. (I wouldn't have bothered filing for a CVE for this change; I see it as a simple hardening change.)  This option shouldn't cripple ftpsync as a well-run repository is highly unlikely to have symlinks pointing out of the tree. A repository with symlinks pointing out of the tree is already not a suitable rsync source.
