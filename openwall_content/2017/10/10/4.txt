Regarding security affect, the flaw is somewhat useless for an attacker on a local system as it requires SCSI disk to be present, root privileges or RAWIO caps, but this can be quickly turned into a meaningful attack if a SCSI disk is passed through to a virtual machine. An attacker can issue absolutely legit SCSI read/write commands to a disk in his VM, that will make VM's memory pages used for IO to be extra refcounted. Then attacker can power down a VM and the memory will be definitely lost. Few exploit runs with power cycles in between, and the whole host can get OOM.
