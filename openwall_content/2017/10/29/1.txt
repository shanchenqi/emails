The doc for the module contains a warning, however it leads to a dead link... https://www.drupal.org/project/backup_migrate  Begin forwarded message:  Date: Fri, 27 Oct Subject: Database mishandling at defectivebydesign.org   Dear DefectiveByDesign.org supporter,  On Wednesday, October 25th, we received an email letting us know that an old Drupal database backup file was publicly accessible on defectivebydesign.org, a site operated by the Free Software Foundation. This backup file contained contact information and other details that should not have been public, submitted from You are receiving this message because the file included this email address, possibly linked with other details listed below. We believe it has been publicly accessible since though unadvertised, and until recently, not indexed by search engines.  Within minutes of receiving the report, we removed the file and started auditing defectivebydesign.org and the rest of our sites.  The file did not contain any passwords or password hashes, financial information, mailing addresses, or information about users who interacted with the site without ever logging in. While it is certainly possible, we have seen no evidence that the file was accessed by anyone other than the reporter and the search crawler, nor republished anywhere else.  The file did include (from both real and spambot users' profiles):    * email addresses;   * user and contact names;   * some IP addresses associated with comments on posts;   * phone numbers;   * some preferred language settings;   * some information users shared about whether they participated in a     particular campaign action (like a call-in), and   * timestamps of users submitting data.  While some of this information was intended by users to be public, some of it definitely was not.  I am deeply and personally sorry for this mistake. We know how important your privacy is to you; we fight on your behalf every day against restrictive and invasive technologies that threaten it.  We also don't believe in covering up our mistakes, so I wanted to let you know as soon as possible that you were affected -- shortly after we had finished our initial audit to make sure we understood the full extent of the problem and fixed the most urgent issues.  Even though we are a small team, under pressure to move fast against extremely large forces, this kind of mistake is absolutely unacceptable. We have made many improvements in our security practices since and in light of this failure will be taking a deeper look at what else we need to do.  If you have any follow-up questions, please email us at <sysadmin@....org>, and CC me at <johns@....org>.  On behalf of everyone here: We are sorry.  Thank you,   John Sullivan   Executive Director    P.S. If you are a Drupal site administrator using the backup-migrate module, make sure to check your configuration settings to ensure backup files are private. In just a few minutes of searching, we found others who are making the same mistake we did.  --  * Follow us at <https://status.fsf.org/fsf>.  * Subscribe to our RSS feeds at <https://fsf.org/blogs/RSS>. * Join us as an associate member at <https://www.fsf.org/jf>.
