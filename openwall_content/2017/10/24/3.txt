Fix grammar typo.  Public release.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Grant copying code made an implication that any grant pin would be accompanied by a suitable page reference.  Other portions of code, however, did not match up with that assumption.  When such a grant copy operation is being done on a grant of a dying domain, the assumption turns out wrong.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest administrator can cause hypervisor memory corruption, most likely resulting in host crash and a Denial of Service.  Privilege escalation and information leaks cannot be ruled out.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen versions from 4.2 onwards are vulnerable.  Xen versions 4.1 and earlier are not vulnerable.  Both x86 and ARM are vulnerable, and on x86 both PV and HVM guests can trigger the vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only guests without para-virtual drivers, and known not to issue grant table operations can avoid the vulnerability.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Pawel Wieczorkiewicz of Amazon.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            xen-unstable       Xen 4.9.x, Xen 4.8.x, Xen 4.7.x, Xen 4.6.x       Xen 4.5.x  $     $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
