This is interesting, but it's mostly off-topic for oss-security, so as a moderator I ask that further discussion please be handled on other lists (once Juan's message probably gets through moderation in there).  Our only poor excuse for having this on oss-security at all is the use of Open Source tools to demonstrate the attack - Metasploit, JtR, Samba - but I think it's not enough of a reason to have postings like this on oss-security.  If others feel differently, please let me know.  Juan, please re-read the oss-security list content guidelines, and note that we not only require relevance to Open Source (lacking here), but also discourage cross-postings:  http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security#list-content-guidelines  "Please keep discussions relevant to Open Source software.  This is not a list to discuss the behavior or problems with closed source software or companies."  "Please don't cross-post messages to oss-security and other mailing lists at once, especially not to high-volume lists such as LKML and netdev, as this tends to result in threads that wander partially or fully off-topic (e.g., Linux kernel coding style detail may end up being discussed in comments to a patch posted to LKML, but it would be off-topic for oss-security).  If you feel that something needs to be posted to oss-security and to another list, please make separate postings.  You may mention the other posting(s) in your oss-security posting, and even link to other lists' archives."  No reply to this message is expected, unless there's relevant detail to add (e.g., the same issue also present in certain Open Source software).
