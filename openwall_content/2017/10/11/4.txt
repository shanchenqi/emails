The following  releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * Jenkins (weekly) * Jenkins (LTS)  Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you find security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  Users with permission to create or configure agents in Jenkins could  configure a launch method called Launch agent via execution of command on  master. This allowed them to run arbitrary shell commands on the master  node whenever the agent was supposed to be launched.  Information about Jenkins user accounts is generally available to anyone  with Overall/Read permissions via the /user/(username)/api remote API. This  included e.g. Jenkins users' email addresses if the Mailer Plugin is  installed.  Jenkins bundled a version of the commons-httpclient library with the  vulnerability that incorrectly verified SSL certificates,  making it susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.  The remote API at /computer/(agent-name)/api showed information about tasks  (typically builds) currently running on that agent. This included  information about tasks that the current user otherwise has no access to,  e.g. due to lack of Job/Read permission.  The remote API at /queue/item/(ID)/api showed information about tasks in  the queue (typically builds waiting to start). This included information  about tasks that the current user otherwise has no access to, e.g. due to  lack of Job/Read permission.  The remote API at /job/(job-name)/api contained information about upstream  and downstream projects. This included information about tasks that the  current user otherwise has no access to, e.g. due to lack of Job/Read  permission.  The Jenkins default form control for passwords and other secrets,  <f:password/>, supports form validation (e.g. for API keys). The form  validation AJAX requests were sent via GET, which could result in secrets  being logged to a HTTP access log in non-default configurations of  Jenkins, and made available to users with access to these log files.
