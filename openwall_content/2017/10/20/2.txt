It fixes vulnerability described in The JMX server, also used by the command line client is exposed to a java de-serialization issue, and thus can be used to execute arbitrary commands. As James exposes JMX socket by default only on local-host, this vulnerability can only be used for privilege escalation.  Release upgrades the incriminated library.  Note that you can take additional defensive steps in order to mitigate this vulnerability:   - Ensure that you restrict the access to JMX only on local-host   - Ensure that you are using a recent Java Run-time Environment. For instance OpenJDK 8 is vulnerable but OpenJDK 8 u is not.   - You can additionally run James in a container to limit damages of potential exploits   - And of course upgrade to the newest version.
