I wish to be educated. >  Whether you think it applies to the current example is obviously a different debate, but the simple principle is that the script is (arguably) using the underlying tool unsafely. The tool (rsync in this case) provides an argument to prevent the "risky" behaviour, but the calling script isn't using it, potentially opening a vector for misuse.  So if there should be a CVE, it shouldn't be against rsync (as it provides the means to avoid, and in other cases you may even find the calling script is overriding the "safe" behaviour) but against the calling script.  To give a fairly limited example, both of these scripts rely on the same functionality, but one is riskier (albeit not from a security perspective) - in neither case is the tool at risk  fname=$1 rm -rf "/$1"  ...  fname=$1 rm -rf --no-preserve-root "/$1"   Obviously it's quite easy for there to be more severe connotations to other scripts (for example, think about some of the things you might pass adduser) which may well be worthy of a CVE by nature of them effectively misusing a tool.  Back on topic, I can see potential for abuse, though I'm also not convinced whether it's CVE worthy.    > > We are overwhelmed with more vulnerabilities than can be fixed quickly > already. > > Are "just to be safer" type things really a wise use of our resources? > > The problem there is setting the threshold. It's not unheard of for a "just in case" fix to later have proved to have mitigated a more severe (and at the time, unknown) issue.
