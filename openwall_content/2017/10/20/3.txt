I'm having trouble understanding how a script could ever be deserving of a CVE. Maybe I'm wrong. I wish to be educated.  We are overwhelmed with more vulnerabilities than can be fixed quickly already.  Are "just to be safer" type things really a wise use of our resources?  Does a proliferation of a large number of low-caliber problems make monitoring these lists more trouble than it's worth? Does it cause high-impact problems to be lost amongst low-impact ones?
