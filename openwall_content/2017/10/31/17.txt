When a view is created over a given table, the policy enforcement does not happen correctly on the table for masked columns.  Mitigation: users should upgrade to users should upgrade to obtain the latest source from git for branch-2.2 or apply this patch which will be included from 2.1.x users should upgrade to obtain the latest source from git for branch-2.1 or apply this patch which will be included from  To mitigate this vulnerability until Hive is upgraded to a new version, there are two possible options. These steps need to be done manually in Ranger / Hive. 1) Restrict users from creating views on tables with column masking rules defined. For this in Ranger Hive Policy:  - Users should not have SELECT permission for those Table columns with masking rules defined.  - Give SELECT permission only for those columns without masking rules defined. 2) Review the Hive Column Masking Policies maintained in Ranger for the tables. Then check in Hive if views that read those tables have been defined. If present, either change the view definition so those columns are not selected or directly drop those views.
