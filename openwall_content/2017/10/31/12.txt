Good thing to point out.  Same goes for other editors that drop ~ and #...# files and the like.  The default location shouldn't be an exposure.  Sure, you can argue that maybe some systems should ignore these files, block access, etc, but it is pretty absurd to expect every other piece of software in the universe to work around very unsafe defaults of text editors.    Also, it almost never makes sense to put things in /tmp, for several reasons pointed out by others.  Making ~/.vim/... the default location clearly is the best solution.
