If you edit a file directly in /tmp, vim will happily read a swapfile  that were planted there by somebody else. Local users could exploit this  for denial of service (or maybe worse if there are any swapfile parsing  bugs...).  Is that a bug in vim? Or is it a user error to edit file directly in  /tmp?  In the latter case, we should fix at least vipe(1) and vidir(1) from  moreutils; and run-mailcap(1).  --  Jakub Wilk  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
