And next time could be after a reboot.  Maybe we just need to change the default backup pattern to something that isn't hidden by default?  e.g. wp-config.php.swp (no leading period), or wp-config.php~ ?  Thus, it's more likely to be caught by the developer.  Honestly, The real problem is just webserver design in general.  In order to have automatic reboot/restart, you need to grossly compromise security in several ways.    a) store the server ssl key on disk without a password.   b) store passwords in the clear in config files, readable by the      running server user.  The real answer is "Don't do that."  Which, years ago, was really infeasible since most servers were physically hosted and redundancy was expensive.  But we're not there anymore.  Wether you use a caching provider like cloudflare, or a hosting service using VMs, there's plenty of cheap redundancy.  Having an individual box down doesn't mean your site is down.  So, this gives us some wiggle room to ask for a password to decrypt the key (or, load from remote), and provide credentials for the server to access other resources.  But, I digress.  Yes, vim swap files are a problem.  But only because we've built stupid decisions (necessary at one time) into the design.  thx,  Jason.
