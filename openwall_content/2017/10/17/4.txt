Could you please run a reproducer from (it does only a number of disk reads and allocates a memory):   and check if the issue reproduces on your system? The system should have a scsi disk, so for a virtual machine a virtio disk (/dev/vda) won't work, but a virtual scsi disk (/dev/sda) should.  Please, check a value of 'Active(anon)' in /proc/meminfo before and after running a reproducer, it should jump up for 40Mb and should not decrease, like this:  (as root)# grep anon /proc/meminfo ; ./sgio-leak /dev/sda ; grep anon /proc/meminfo Active(anon):      kB Inactive(anon):     kB Active(anon):      kB Inactive(anon):     kB (as root)# grep anon /proc/meminfo ; ./sgio-leak /dev/sda ; grep anon /proc/meminfo Active(anon):      kB Inactive(anon):     kB Active(anon):     kB Inactive(anon):     kB  If the issue in not reproduced, 'Active(anon)' should jump up shortly but return to the previous before-the-run value on an idle system.
