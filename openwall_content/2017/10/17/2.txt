It uses rsync to do the heavy lifting.  rsync can copy symlinks.  We enable this option, as the Debian tree includes symlinks in various of locations.  Unless a special option (--safe-links) is given, such symlinks can point to arbitrary locations, even outside of the mirror tree.  An attacker with the ability to add symlinks to the upstream mirror can create symlinks to arbitrary files or even directories.  Depending on the config, a HTTP server will follow such symlinks.
