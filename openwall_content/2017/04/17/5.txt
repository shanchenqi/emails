Since we do not know which of you may be trying to do this we are notifying all parties to whom we sent the CVE details.  If you are using the security releases provided by ISC without changes or if you are not trying to selectively backport fixes to earlier BIND versions you can ignore the rest of this message.  For those who ARE backporting the security fixes to earlier versions of BIND:  several parties have reported to us that backporting to a version of BIND that does not have change can cause an assertion failure to appear in name.c in the vicinity of line (the exact line number varies by version) with the error message:    REQUIRE(prefix == ((void *)0) || ((((prefix) != ((void *)0)) && (((const isc__magic_t *)(prefix))->magic == ((('D') << 24 | ('N') << 16 | ('S') << 8 | ('n'))))) && prefix->buffer != ((void *)0) && ((prefix->attributes & == 0))) failed  To test whether the version of BIND you have produced is subject to this assertion failure, we recommend you run the dname test in the provided BIND system tests.  (Actually, we recommend you run that in any case.)    build named:     ./configure && make    then:     cd bin/tests/system     as root:  sh ./ifconfig.sh up     sh ./run.sh dname  If your named crashes you should correct the problem; see change  ISC doesn't officially support selective backporting of changes and we cannot guarantee that there may not be other issues, depending on which combination of changes you have selected.  However this issue has been reported by several parties and we are providing what info we have on it in the hopes that it will help those who repackage and redistribute our code.
