The fix has been sent upstream [2], whether all related issues are fixed by the two proposed patches (see whole thread at [3]) is still under discussion.  Not affected: - Upstream: stable kernels from kernel.org, such as  Affected: - Upstream: all current RCs (rc1-rc7) are affected. - Ubuntu commit ("net sched actions: Add support for   user cookies") which introduced the problematic code was backported to   Ubuntu kernel, which is affected[4]. - Proxmox VE 5.0 Beta: the Proxmox VE kernel which was based on   was affected[5], the subsequently released PVE   kernel contains the fix from [2]. The current PVE stable   release 4.4 is not affected.  Thanks to Wolfang Bumiller for analysis and proposed fixes. Thanks to "Ivensiya" <ivensiya@...il.com> for the initial bug report[5] that lead to the discovery.  1: 2: 3: 4: 5:   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
