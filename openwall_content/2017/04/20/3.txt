I am going to list as much information as possible below. Credits for the findings go to "Meifang, Yang @VARAS of IIE". I advised the researcher to report this issue upstream, however, it seems the communication failed.  A vulnerability was found while fuzzing libbpg It is a NULL pointer dereference issue due to missing check of the return value of function malloc in the BPG encoder. This vulnerability appeared while converting a malicious JPEG file to BPG.  The problem seems to be line in function image_alloc. Due to the missing check, value of img->data[i] could be NULL and crash the program.  Unfortunately, I don't have access to the reproducer.
