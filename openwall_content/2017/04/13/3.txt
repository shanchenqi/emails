A fuzz via the sndfile-resample command-line tool of libsamplerate, discovered and invalid memory read and an invalid memory write. The upstream author Erik de Castro Lopo (erikd) said that they was  fixed in the recent commit which addresses As usual Iâm providing the stacktrace and the reproducer so that all release distros can test and check  if their version is affected or not.
