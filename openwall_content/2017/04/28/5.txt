Cairo is a 2d graphics library, and HarBuzz is an OpenType text shaping engine which contains a tool named *hb-view* to give a graphical view of text using Cairo with a font provided by user. Owing to logical problem in program, the crash happens during null pointer deference and the vulnerability will cause a denial-of-service attack with a crafted font file.  ## Note I have reported this issue to cairo and here is the link:  When I disclosure to Red Hat Product Security, they suggest me to use for this issue and I have communicated this number to upstream.
