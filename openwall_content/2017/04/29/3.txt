The method gets the memory data using dict_memory() and treats it as an object to call its gs_alloc_struct() method. in the Evince code execution demo,  uses ghostscript (libgs.so) as the .ps file processor and another demo attack imagick is the shell command injection vuln.  and is a part of my exploit last year it also affect some programs use ghostscript that's why I use Evince as the example.
