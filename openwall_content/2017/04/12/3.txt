Maybe we need a final definite answer to them all :-)  The reasoning is roughly: It's undefined behavior, so the compiler can do whatever it wants. So all undefined behavior should be considered security relevant, because the compiler can always do something that will turn it into a vuln. Whether you agree to this or not, it's definitely good secure coding practice to avoid undefined behavior. People have different ideas of what to call a vuln and what not. CVE-assigners have lately taken a very wide approach of declaring many things as cve-worthy. Just accept that not every CVE means "it's definitely exploitable".  --  Hanno Bรถck https://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
