It could occur  while initialising SCSI message ring buffer in pvscsi_ring_init_msg().  A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to consume host cpu cycles  or crash the Qemu process resulting in DoS.  Upstream patch: ---------------    ->  Reference: ----------    ->  This issue was independently reported by Li Qiang of Qihoo Gear  Team and YY Z(CC'd).  assigned via -> http://cveform.mitre.org/  Thank you. -- Prasad J Pandit / Red Hat Product Security Team 47AF CE69 54AA DD13 FE5B  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
