Meanwhile, why don't you simply proceed to assign CVEs per requests made in here like you do on (linux-)distros?  I think this would help.  As you're aware, personally I'm not into CVEs, but I liked the side-effect that people's desire to have CVEs brought more vulnerability information in here.  I am a bit concerned that MITRE's change may result in us getting notified in fewer cases, especially if we continue to redirect to MITRE those CVE requests that still arrive in here.  This is going to result in not only fewer CVE requests sent in here, but also in fewer vulnerabilities being disclosed in here - or at least in them being brought in here with an extra delay (after MITRE has assigned a CVE ID and reminded the person that they should notify oss-security, which thankfully they do).
