With PS/EPS being processed also from the network with -dSAFER, this would count for remote code execution.  The ghostscript bug is and had some more comments but was made private a bit after I last accessed it.  I captured the first comment at least in our bug.  The problem is I think around a type confusion in the rsdparams command.
