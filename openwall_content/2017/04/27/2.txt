Note this may affect earlier versions than but I didn't check them.  [Suggested description] gnome-shell through mishandles extensions that fail to reload, which can lead to leaving extensions enabled in the lock screen. With these extensions, a bystander could launch applications (but not interact with them), see information from the extensions (e.g., what applications you have opened or what music you were playing), or even execute arbitrary commands. It all depends on what extensions a user has enabled. The problem is caused by lack of exception handling in js/ui/extensionSystem.js.  ------------------------------------------  [Vulnerability Type] Incorrect Access Control  ------------------------------------------  [VulnerabilityType Other] Incorrect Access Control  ------------------------------------------  [Vendor of Product] GNOME  ------------------------------------------  [Affected Product Code Base] gnome-shell - -  ------------------------------------------  [Affected Component] js/ui/extensionSystem.js  ------------------------------------------  [Attack Type] Physical  ------------------------------------------  [Impact Code execution] true  ------------------------------------------  [Impact Information Disclosure] true  ------------------------------------------  [Attack Vectors] A broken gnome-shell extension needs to be installed (broken as in may work normally, but has a bug where it fails to reload properly)  An extension reload needs to be triggered (which can happen for multiple reasons)  ------------------------------------------  [Reference] https://github.com/EasyScreenCast/EasyScreenCast/issues/46  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
