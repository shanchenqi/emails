I say this because the commit message makes no mention of this partially fixing a CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM bypass (and I suppose a Secure Boot bypass, but what isn't these days?), and similarly makes no mentions of the modifications it makes to the write side.  CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM exists to prevent userland from directly modifying kernel memory, yet the kernel will happily make slab allocations in allowed regions below 1MB.  CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM explicitly allowed both reads and writes to these allocations.  As noted, the commit below doesn't fix the mmap side.   Feel free to look at GRKERNSEC_KMEM code going back to in our patch, or when it changed in for or this explicit hunk, comment and all, that's been around ever since CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM was added in  +#ifdef CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_KMEM +       /* throw out everything else below 1MB */ +       if (pagenr <= +               return 0; +#endif  <additional comments/details removed:  While I'm here, some more VMAP_STACK fallout (DoS/potential memory corruption, adding to the dozen or so posted earlier):  Thanks, -Brad   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
