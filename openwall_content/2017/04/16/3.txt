We didn't post it here before, as due to the severity of the issue we wanted to give the opportunity to our users to patch their systems before full public disclosure, so we notified them via private e-mail.  Unfortunately someone decided to post it here (anonymously, too...) in spite of our request to keep the embargo, so here's the rest of the story.  The issue will be fixed in versions and to be released shortly.  Until then, all MantisBT administrators are advised to patch their system immediately. Fixes are availble from our GitHub repository:  - 2.3.x - 2.2.x - 1.3.x  MantisBT issue tracker reference:  Best regards D.
