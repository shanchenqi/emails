On a unpatched instance of mantisBT, this will provide a form to enter a new password for a user.  This works on any enabled account (including users with admin access) - providing an anonymous user with admin access to the system  The issue can be resolved by checking the value of $t_token_confirm_hash is not null in verify.php  i.e. changing the code to read:  if( $f_confirm_hash !== $t_token_confirm_hash || null === $t_token_confirm_hash ) { 	trigger_error( ERROR_LOST_PASSWORD_CONFIRM_HASH_INVALID, ERROR ); }      ---- Sent using Guerrillamail.com Block or report abuse:    Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
