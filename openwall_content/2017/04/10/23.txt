When running an untrusted application under a SecurityManager, it was therefore possible for that untrusted application to retain a reference to the request or response object and thereby access and/or modify information associated with another web application.  Mitigation: Users of the affected versions should apply one of the following mitigations: - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat or later - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat or later - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat or later - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat or later  Credit: This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team.  History: Original advisory  References: [1] [2] http://tomcat.apache.org/security-9.html [3] http://tomcat.apache.org/security-8.html [4] http://tomcat.apache.org/security-7.html   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
