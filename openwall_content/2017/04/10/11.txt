A fuzz on eu-readelf showed a memory allocation failure. Will follow a feedback from upstream:  That is slightly tricky. We do have to trust the input data to give us the expected output size. We wonât know if that was correct till we decompressed the input. We do actually double check the given  output size was correct at the end of the decompression. But we could catch some really bogus sizes before trying to allocate a giant amount of memory and decompressing stuff for nothing (like in this  case).  The complete ASan output:  # eu-readelf -a $FILE AddressSanitizer failed to allocate bytes allocator is terminating the process instead of returning 0 you don't like this behavior set allocator_may_return_null=1 CHECK failed: "((0)) != (0)" (0x0, 0x0)     #0      #1 in __sanitizer::CheckFailed(char const*, int, char const*, unsigned long long, unsigned long long)     #2      #3      #4 in malloc     #5 in __libelf_decompress     #6 in __libelf_decompress_elf     #7 in elf_compress     #8 in handle_hash     #9 in process_elf_file     #10 in process_dwflmod     #11 in dwfl_getmodules     #12 in process_file     #13 in main     #14 in __libc_start_main     #15 in _start  Affected version:  Fixed version: (not released atm)  Commit fix:  Credit: This bug was discovered by Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo.
