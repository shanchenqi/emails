Since there is no cast, *(pp+1) is treated as int, so UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer says: runtime error: left shift of by 24 places cannot be represented in type 'int'  Maybe we could have something like:  *cp++ = BWmap[*pp][0] & << 24 | ~A1);  ###########  Fixed per  Even Rouault <even.rouault at spatialys.com>          * libtiff/tif_getimage.c: add explicit uint32 cast in putagreytile to         avoid UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer warning.
