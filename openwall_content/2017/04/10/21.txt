If the send file processing completed quickly, it was possible for the Processor to be added to the processor cache twice. This could result in the same Processor being used for multiple requests which in turn could lead to unexpected errors and/or response mix-up.  Mitigation: Users of the affected versions should apply one of the following mitigations: - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat or later - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat or later  Credit: This issue was reported publicly as Bug [1] and the security implications identified by the Tomcat security team.  History: Original advisory  References: [1] [2] http://tomcat.apache.org/security-9.html [3] http://tomcat.apache.org/security-8.html   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
