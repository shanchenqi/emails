These waiting streams each consumed a thread. A malicious client could therefore construct a series of HTTP/2 requests that would consume all available processing threads.  Mitigation: Users of the affected versions should apply one of the following mitigations: - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat or later - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat or later  Credit: This issue was identified by Chun Han Hsiao and reported responsibly to the Tomcat security team.  History: Original advisory  References: [1] http://tomcat.apache.org/security-9.html [2] http://tomcat.apache.org/security-8.html   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
