This could result in responses appearing to be sent for the wrong request. For example, a user agent that sent requests A, B and C could see the correct response for request A, the response for request C for request B and no response for request C.  Mitigation: Users of the affected versions should apply one of the following mitigations: - Switch to the BIO HTTP where available - Disable send file - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat or later - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat or later - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat or later - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat or later - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat or later  Credit: This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team.
