Perhaps Ian is referring to the fact that at the "Secret Rabbit Code" home of libsamplerate, to which your linked blog article provides this link: http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/ there is no reference to any version numbers of the form 1.0.x, but only numbers such as (the last release [dated mentioned in the changelog as I write) http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/ChangeLog and (the latest version actually available for download): http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/download.html  I'm just as confused as Ian.
