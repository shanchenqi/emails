I've attached the above URL's content in text/plain form, as required by oss-security content guidelines (actual content must be on the list, not only included by reference).  The bug is in drivers/net/macsec.c implementing IEEE (MACsec). I hope it is rarely used and thus rarely exposed, and Linux kernel support for it is rather new, right?  oss-security is no longer a place to request CVE IDs.  You may request a CVE ID directly from MITRE:  https://cveform.mitre.org  Once you have the CVE ID, please post it to this same thread in here.  (For non-public issues, it is also still possible to request CVE IDs along with notification to the (linux-)distros lists, as long as the primary purpose of giving advance notice to the distros is providing them with actionable information.  A few of the distros are CNAs, so they'd assign CVE IDs from their pools.)
