When a matching file exists, a glob expression which takes massive  time with zsh, takes virtually no time with ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick  (much better than zsh).  However if there is no matching file, then  the amount of time required seems unbounded.  Besides being passed as an explicit argument, glob expressions can be  passed as multiple lines in a text file preceded with a '@' character  like     @filename.txt  Any input file name could be a glob expression.
