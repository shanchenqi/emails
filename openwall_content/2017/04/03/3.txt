In case of an alien code bases; or a code base that is brought in for examination - a third party may doctor the file names as to cause  a certain result of the license compliance scan. Or the attacker may  adversely affect the ninka user their environment (e.g. an automated continuous integration setup) by causing it to hang.  This can then lead to unauthorised disclosure of information, unreliable compliance information or a denial of services.  Versions affected:  - - ------------------ All versions up to and including version  Resolution: - - ----------- Upgrade to version or later - available on https://github.com/dmgerman/ninka.   Mitigations and work arounds: - - ----------------------------- Test the filenames passed for obvious issues. Given that ninka is generally only applied to (source)code - a regex matching just the alphanumerics and a few glyphs such as the dash and dot can usually be applied.
