The issue in question has not yet been fully analyzed and I only did a quick check whether the affected code was present in RHEL 5 when filing it and must have misread my search results since the affected code is definitely not in RHEL 5. Sorry about that.  We do have an "Under investigation" state for the affectedness table on the CVE pages, which is used when no triage has been done on a filed issue.  --  Martin PrpiÄ / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
