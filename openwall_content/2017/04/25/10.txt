An authenticated user may receive all the roles assigned to the user's project regardless of the federation mapping when there are rules in which group-based assignments are not used. For example, by requesting an admin user to get a role in their project, the user may be granted the admin privileges for new scoped tokens. All setups using the Keystone federation without group based assignments rules are affected.
