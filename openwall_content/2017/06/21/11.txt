OpenBSD isn't a member of the distros list - they were notified by Qualys separately.  This matter was discussed, and some folks were unhappy about OpenBSD's action, but in the end it was decided that since, as you correctly say, the underlying issue was already publicly known, OpenBSD's commits don't change things much.  Sure this draws renewed attention to the problem, but probably not to the extent and in the many specific ways the Qualys findings cover.  So it was decided to keep the embargo on the detail.  Ditto for the "move mmap_area and PIE binaries away from the stack" patch series posted to LKML and CC'ed to kernel-hardening on June 2:   which might have been inspired by Qualys work known to Red Hat engineers internally.  A difference is that Red Hat is a member of the distros list.  I brought this up on the distros list, and another Red Hat person said "We'll deal with this internally."  Given the circumstances, I find this response satisfactory.  I am far more concerned about the total embargo duration here than about these two semi-leaks.
