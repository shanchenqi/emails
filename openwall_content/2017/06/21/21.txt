Thank you for clarifying that, my assumption was indeed wrong then.  Still, if OpenBSD was able to resolve the issues necessary after  notification without leaking full details to the public, shouldn't  this have been possible for the other projects without an embargo,  let alone an extended one?  Especially considering that the full  duration of the extended embargo didn't result in complete fixes for  the issue and in fact resulted in a broken fix for Linux, which  could easily have been avoided if the discussions around it happened  in public (and none of the deep details from the Qualys advisory  would have been needed for any of those discussions). for instance mentions Linus' fix blew up in 3 minutes of fuzz testing.  > Ditto for the "move mmap_area and PIE binaries away from the stack" > patch series posted to LKML and CC'ed to kernel-hardening on June 2: >  > >  > which might have been inspired by Qualys work known to Red Hat engineers > internally.

At first I was rather concerned about this, so I emailed Rik  directly and asked him the simple question of whether the advance  notice prioritized or kickstarted the process of porting those  features, regardless of having looked at some code in the past (as I  imagine much of our code has been looked at).  I too am satisfied  with his answer that the actual porting work on his part had already been done prior to that notice, and that any internal concerns afterward were simply to avoid the appearance of impropriety.  My take on the embargoing process (outside of what's already mentioned on https://grsecurity.net/an_ancient_kernel_hole_is_not_closed.php ): I've always been concerned by the fact that smaller distros seem to  be barred from distros-list membership; it seems the arrangement  lends itself too much to enabling the marketing of the larger  companies and in fact perhaps even disincentivizing their investment  in security as the embargo process enables them to skirt much of the  public pain they'd otherwise have to experience (for in this  instance what was a completely avoidable problem).  I get the practical reasons for the policy (increased leak risk, major distros often do the actual fixing work, etc) but from a level of principle it's always rubbed me the wrong way.  So despite that I have full trust in you Alexander as being  completely transparent and impartial despite having to engage in a  bit of politics necessary to work with all the companies involved, I  am uneasy (and I believe I note some uneasiness in your own mails)  with how others are exploiting the arrangment despite your sincere efforts at sticking to the policies you established.  That said, I think regardless of whether you head the distros list or not, the major companies are going to see it to be in their financial/PR interest to maintain an embargo list.  I would not be surprised at all if were you to step down from the role/shutter the list, a company like Red Hat would quickly swoop in to "take the reins."  Which would be a shame and adds to my general worries about the direction this industry is going in, since your record for fairness is sterling, and I doubt very much that dogged dedicated to transparency, fairness, and ethics would continue with anyone else at the helm.
