For the sake of transparency and an improved disclosure process in the future, we will do the same now, and also address some of the concerns that have been expressed since Monday.  But first, we would like to thank everyone who was involved in this disclosure, for their hard work and patience, and especially Solar for creating and administering the mailing-lists that made it possible (and for accepting, although reluctantly, the embargo extension).  On Mon, Jun 19, at Solar Designer wrote: > The stated argument for extending the embargo duration beyond list > policy's maximum was that fixes presumably wouldn't be ready.  This was not the only reason why we eventually decided to extend the embargo;  here is what we wrote in an e-mail to distros@, on May 28:  """ The discussions that took place here on distros eventually forced us to extend the embargo from the original CRD (May 30) to June 19:  - there are serious problems with the two solutions that we proposed   ("Increase the size of the stack guard-page" and "Recompile all   userland code with GCC's -fstack-check option");  - please see Red Hat's analysis, attached;  - when we asked here if distros would be ready by May 30, only three   answered (two "yes", one "no"), and hoping for the best ("the ones who   did not answer will surely be ready") was not an option, and "let's   publish anyway on May 30, distros should have been ready" was not an   option either (the end users would be the ones suffering from such a   debacle). """  The first problem was that 1MB is not enough on all architectures;  the second problem was that -fstack-check does not always "touch" all pages; and Red Hat's analysis was an extensive report about the fixes needed in the kernel, the glibc, and gcc.  All of this, plus the third reason mentioned above, and our own assessment of the situation, helped us make our decision to extend the embargo.  > I understand > it's rare for companies to do quality security research, and I didn't > want my action to have hampered the stream of quality security research > we're seeing from Qualys lately.  Thank you very much.  However, we must admit that this coordinated release has been one of the most stressful and painful experiences we ever had:  we were torn between those who wanted to publish early and those who wanted to publish later, and in the middle of all this coordination we were trying to complete our research (we had not successfully exploited 64-bit Linux yet when we first contacted distros@).  Such a responsible disclosure could have been, and should have been, easier and simpler, even with so many vendors involved.  How could such a situation be handled better next time?  We are open to suggestions.  Finally, we would like to address a concern that has been voiced by Chris Evans (who has also quoted Solar's mail, thus answering here):  """ There's also the question of whether "customers" get access to details before patches are available """  Absolutely not:  we have not shared a single detail of these vulnerabilities with anyone outside of Qualys before the Coordinated Release Date;  and even within Qualys, we have kept this compartmentalized until the very end.  Thank you very much!
