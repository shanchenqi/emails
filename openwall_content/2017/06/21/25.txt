With a 64k guard, you should be OK and protected.  -fstack-check will consistently skip bytes on x86 on most architectures).  Even if you combined the skipped space from the prologue and the skipped space in the dynamic area, you're only at just over 16k -- and it's not clear the two skipped areas could be combined like that anyway.   Given the larger guard you should be in good shape.  Sorry to have sounded alarmist without having full information about your configuration, particularly WRT the expanded guard page.   --  There's one theoretical approach I'm aware of that one could use the skip the guard in your situation.  I'm not aware of any code in practice that would have the right properties to trigger *and* triggering would require a particular optimization that neither LLVM nor GCC perform to the best my knowledge (nor are they likely to as the optimization would not likely improve any hot path performance).  We'll be making that theoretical attack significantly harder to exploit as part of the upstream GCC work around a new -fstack-check implementation.
