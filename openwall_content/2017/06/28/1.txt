To do that the component communicates to an external PHP server (http://ignite.run) where it needs to send some system properties like Apache Ignite or Java version. Some of the properties might contain user sensitive information.  Mitigation:  * The domain (http://ignite.run) was moved to ASF and the server was brought down. No data transfer longer happens by default. No extra actions are needed on the end user side.  Credit:  The vulnerability was discovered by:   * Makoto Yui of Treasure Data, Inc.
