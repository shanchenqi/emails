I discovered some crashes (which will follow one-by-one) in lame.  Lame was fuzzed in the past by someone else so I take the opportunity  during the CVE request to insert also some past bugs.  1) Invalid read -  2) Null pointer dereference -  3) Invalid read -  However, mitre decided that the bug NÂ°3, can share the  same CVE ID of  At this point, I'd like to mention that mitre won't assign anymore CVE IDs  for issues related to the Undefined Behavior Sanitizer, unless there are  informations about the exploitability.  The CVE IDs assigned in the past for the undefined behavior issues remain  valid. I will share anyway my findings about the undefined behavior issues.  They include, for completeness, some bugs that regard the frontend. You  can ignore them.  --  Agostino Sarubbo Gentoo Linux Developer   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
