Thank you.  Since Fedora and Slackware published their updates, and FreeBSD and NetBSD published their patches (and our *BSD POCs are not full-fledged exploits anyway), we attached our Stack Clash exploits and POCs to this mail (alternatively, they are also available at https://www.qualys.com/research/security-advisories/).  A few notes on the Linux ld.so exploits:  - Linux_ldso_dynamic's probability of success varies significantly from   one SUID binary to another, because it depends on the size of the   .dynamic, .data, and .bss sections of the SUID binary.  - Linux_ldso_hwcap's probability of success depends on the length of the   path to the SUID binary -- as a rule of thumb, the longer the path,   the higher the probability of success.  - On Fedora and CentOS, Linux_ldso_hwcap_64 may not work against   "short-path" SUID binaries, but it works against the "long-path" SUIDs   that are installed by default (for example,   /usr/lib/polkit-1/polkit-agent-helper-1).    Moreover, we wrote a quick-and-dirty version of this exploit that does   work against the SUIDs in /usr/bin (it does not hardcode the   sizes of argv[] pointers/free stack space, but instead optimizes these   sizes).  However, we wanted to keep the main loop of this exploit as   simple as possible, and this improvement is therefore left as an   exercise for the interested reader.  We are at your disposal for questions, comments, and further discussions.  Thank you very much!
