I'm responsible for RancherOS, and think that both I, and my users would prefer that I had access to the embargoed information earlier, so preparing a response would have been less of a rush.   One of the things that would have made my last week less worrying, is to have some access to exploit code - so as to verify the changes actually had a useful effect.   RancherOS is a container oriented micro-linux distro with uptake in hybrid and on-premis clouds  We have the beginnings of an advisory page at http://rancher.com/docs/os/security/  And are happy to comply with embargos.  Also - keep up the awesome work - its impressive!   ________________________________ From: Euan Kemp <euan.kemp@...eos.com> Sent: 27 June To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: Re: [oss-security] CoreOS membership to linux-distros  On PM, Kurt Seifried wrote: > My main question would be what expertise do you have in helping with > security issues, e.g. kernel/glibc/other engineering talent?

To clarify your example, we're primarily concerned with preparing updates for our distribution's kernel and userland, not for containers.  We'd be happy to help when we're able to, but our intent is mainly consumption for the security of our users. We'll, of course, respect embargoes.  - Euan    Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
