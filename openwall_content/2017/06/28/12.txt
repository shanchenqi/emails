I did already find a few test tools - and thanks - yours also suggests that with the RancherOS release I made a few days ago, that we've done what we can (ok, so I actually delayed and didn't release the patched version I gleaned was the set - I was able to use - as we're trying hard to be pure upstream whenever possible)   IDK - I wouldn't call it "on a golden platter" - I'm trying to suggest that the bigger players have a tonne more knowledge and experience than we newer and smaller players do - but perhaps we can work out how the smaller distros can also get some early information and guidance - and perhaps that'll help mentor us up into doing more.

I can relate to the rush feeling, even with few users/"private" distro here, having a custom kernel makes this kind of fixes annoying... But given the delayed exploit release I'd say it does not really matter if you take a few days for this, especially in this case with the low success rate on 64bit linux. As soon as reasonably possible does not necessarily mean rush.  As a rhel/centos spin-off though we would have liked the bug brought up here ( ) to have its fix published faster though, it's apparently been ready for a week but not been published... I don't mind bugs, but if it's fixed it's annoying to keep it behind closed doors.   > One of the things that would have made my last week less worrying, is > to have some access to exploit code - so as to verify the changes > actually had a useful effect.  You don't need an actual exploit to test this. You're not the first person who have told me this so I actually took some time this morning to whip up a "tester" -- it's probably far from perfect but will run successfully on older debian/rhel and crash with a patched kernel as expected, and is as inoffensive as it can get.  I'm sure there are other better testers online, I didn't try looking as I don't get much chance to play with this kind of stuff :)   Qualys gave a lot of details in their report (kudos to well written advisories like that!), I agree having everything on a golden plate is better but it really isn't much work left for smaller distros if you trust the big ones or even just upstream, once bugs got steamed out.  -- Asmadeus | Dominique Martinet   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
