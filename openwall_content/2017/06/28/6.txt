Few notes before the details of this bug. Time ago a fuzz was done by Brian Carpenter and Jakub Wilk which posted the results on the debian  bugtracker. In cases like this, when upstream is not active and people do not post on the upstream bugzilla is easy discover duplicates, so I  downloaded all available testcases, and noone of the bug you will see on my blog is a duplicate of an existing issue. Upstream seems a bit  dead, latest release was into so this blog post will probably forwarded on the upstream bugtracker just for the record.
