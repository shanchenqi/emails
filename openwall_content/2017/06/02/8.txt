It is not legal for /proc/self/stat to +       contain embedded NUL bytes so treat the file as corrupt if we see +       any. With help from Qualys. + +       This is not exploitable due to the /dev traversal changes in sudo +       (thanks Solar!).  which says it is NOT exploitable, but you're saying that it is actually exploitable? If confirmed yes I'll get you a new CVE for this asap.
