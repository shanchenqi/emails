ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The block interface response structure has some discontiguous fields. Certain backends populate the structure fields of an otherwise uninitialized instance of this structure on their stacks, leaking data through the (internal or trailing) padding field.  IMPACT ======  A malicious unprivileged guest may be able to obtain sensitive information from the host or other guests.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Linux versions supporting the xen-blkback, blkback, or blktap drivers are vulnerable.  FreeBSD, NetBSD and Windows (with or without PV drivers) are not vulnerable (either because they do not have backends at all, or because they use a different implementation technique which does not suffer from this problem).  All qemu versions supporting the Xen block backend are vulnerable.  The qemu-xen-traditional code base does not include such code, so is not vulnerable.  Note that an instance of qemu will be spawned to provide the backend for most non-raw-format disks; so you may need to apply the patch to qemu even if you use only PV guests.  MITIGATION ==========  There's no mitigation available for x86 PV and ARM guests.  For x86 HVM guests it may be possible to change the guest configuaration such that a fully virtualized disk is being made available instead.  However, this would normally entail changes inside the guest itself.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Anthony Perard of Citrix.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            Linux 4.5 ...            Linux 3.3 ... 4.4                qemu-upstream master, 4.8            qemu-upstream 4.7, 4.6            qemu-upstream 4.5      $       $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  However, deployment of the mitigation is NOT permitted (except where all the affected systems and VMs are administered and used only by organisations which are members of the Xen Project Security Issues Predisclosure List).  Specifically, deployment on public cloud systems is NOT permitted.  This is because this produces a guest-visible change which will indicate which component contains the vulnerability.  Additionally, distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
