Everything Qualys brought to distros so far is now public.  I have to correct the above statement as I totally forgot about the exploits.  While all issues Qualys brought to distros so far are now public, Qualys' own exploits for them are not public yet.  IIRC, Qualys selectively sent the exploits to affected vendors, but that included sending the Linux-specific exploits to the linux-distros sub-list.  Qualys, I suggest that, like you did with the Sudo exploit, you publish your Stack Clash exploits in here as soon as third-party exploits of comparable functionality appear, or next Tuesday, whichever is earlier.  Please confirm that you intend to do so in a reply to this message, so that everyone in here knows what to expect.
