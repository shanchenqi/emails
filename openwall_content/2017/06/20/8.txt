ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Certain actions require removing pages from a guest's P2M (Physical-to-Machine) mapping.  When large pages are in use to map guest pages in the 2nd-stage page tables, such a removal operation may incur a memory allocation (to replace a large mapping with individual smaller ones).  If this allocation fails, these errors are ignored by the callers, which would then continue and (for example) free the referenced page for reuse.  This leaves the guest with a mapping to a page it shouldn't have access to.  The allocation involved comes from a separate pool of memory created when the domain is created; under normal operating conditions it never fails, but a malicious guest may be able to engineer situations where this pool is exhausted.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest may be able to access memory it doesn't own, potentially allowing privilege escalation, host crashes, or information leakage.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen versions from at least 3.2 onwards are vulnerable.  Older versions have not been inspected.  Both x86 and ARM systems are vulnerable.  On x86 systems, only HVM guests can leverage the vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  On x86, specifying "hap_1gb=0 hap_2mb=0" on the hypervisor command line will avoid the vulnerability.  Alternatively, running all x86 HVM guests in shadow mode will also avoid this vulnerability.  (For example, by specifying "hap=0" in the xl domain configuration file.)  There is no known mitigation on ARM systems.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Julien Grall of ARM.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate pair of attached patches resolves this issue.                         xen-unstable       Xen 4.8.x                    Xen 4.7.x                    Xen 4.6.x   Xen 4.5.x  $         $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
