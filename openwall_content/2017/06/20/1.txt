We are not aware of any exploits of this flaw.  INFO ----  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name to this issue.  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  This flaw exists in the following c-ares versions.  - Affected versions: c-ares to and including - Not affected versions: c-ares >=  THE SOLUTION ------------  In version the `RR_len` value gets checked properly and the function is also added to the fuzz testing. It was previously accidentally left out from that.  A [patch for is available.  RECOMMENDATIONS ---------------  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:    A - Upgrade c-ares to version    B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild    C - Do not use `ares_parse_naptr_reply()`.  TIME LINE ---------  It was reported to the c-ares project on May 20. We contacted distros@...nall on June 16.  c-ares was released on June 20 coordinated with the publication of this advisory.  CREDITS -------  Thanks to LCatro for the report and to David Drysdale for the fix.  --     / daniel.haxx.se  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
