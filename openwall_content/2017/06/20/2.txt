It's possible to use it for C with the __morestack call set up to simply abort when stack space is exhausted.  That's what Rust was doing after it dropped segmented stacks, but they wanted to move to stack probes for efficiency and prematurely dropped these function prelude checks.  It's not efficient, but it works, unlike -fstack-check.  I don't think it makes sense for general purpose distributions to adopt it but it's an available option for others with more concern about this issue.
