Russian scientist published the article describing how he found the malware in BMC BIOS flash memory. The article is available in English now.  It's been a long while, but if you're referring to the same thing I read in Russian back then (and it looks so), I can say that IMO it lacked substance too.  From the text, I couldn't discern whether the author wrote a fine piece of science fiction (with sufficiently good knowledge of the underlying "science") or a documentary, but either way there were no specifics that would enable anyone else to reproduce the findings.  Unless anyone has anything on-topic (focus on Open Source) and specific (ideally, reproducible) to add, let's end this oss-security thread here.
