I completely agree with you but then I can't explain why you chose to insult our projects last week and still have not remedied it (both the CVE and your insulting tweet are still up). I find it curious how you can preach about professionalism after being the very instigator of the recent splat (heck, instead of answering, you called it a conspiracy theory when I asked you in private why you issued the CVE to begin with which then forced us to take the issue public).  cheers,  PaX Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
