When you have a CVE the simple rule is:  If you got it publicly the CNA (CVE Numbering Authority) you got it from should have published it to their upstream (e.g. MITRE).  If you got it embargoed and it's now public you should tell the CNA you got it from that it is public, and ideally also tell MITRE (https://cveform.mitre.org/).  Rule of thumb is: when it goes public, tell the issuer, and/or MITRE so they can publish it.
