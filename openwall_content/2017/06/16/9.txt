Very few toolkits handle this well, and even given how many regex toolkits use backtracking, even 'safe' regexes can lead to essentially unbounded execution time.  Some regex engines like Rust's regex and Go's regex should handle untrusted inputs well: they're non-backtracking engines and type-safe languages.  Hypothetical crashes like this probably would qualify for CVEs in either of these environments. But I'm less convinced it makes sense with C-based engines to allow untrusted inputs.  http://www.etalabs.net/compare_libcs.html suggests that uclibc's regex is DFA-based thus it's probably intended to allow untrusted inputs -- but is that explicitely stated as a goal anywhere?
