JavaScript regular expressions use the regex dialect originating in Perl, which is also used in Python and libpcre (and, via libpcre, in PHP). The two standardized POSIX dialects implemented by Unix C libraries (basic regexes as used in grep and sed, and extended regexes as used in grep -E and sed -E) aren't fully compatible with the Perl syntax: for example \s matches the letter s in BREs or EREs, but matches any whitespace character in the Perl-derived dialects. This makes the POSIX regex functions not particularly useful for implementors of a JavaScript runtime.
