One use case are "sandbox" languages, such as JavaScript. JS engines often use third-party regex libraries with attacker-controlled regexes. They don't particularly about OOM / CPU exhaustion, but RCE that allows a malicious program to escape containment would be bad news.  Probably no JS engine using uclibc, though.  /mz  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
