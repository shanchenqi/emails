What would be the approach to software whose > documentation starts out with "turn off selinux," out of curiosity?  Good question. I would rephrase it was "turn off the firewall" or "turn off the Anti virus" and I think we're definitely into the "yes, that needs a CVE" territory (even if it can't be fixed, at least people will be more aware and maybe make more informed decisions when picking).  > Obviously this lessens the security stance of the system, but presumably > the system is designed to be operable without selinux.

I would say that being told/forced (e.g. most systems that say turn off SELinux say that because they couldn't make it work with SELinux on) do definitely expose the system and people need to be aware of this.  >  >> 3) Unofficial but commonly used documentation and code examples, I guess >> the best example here is stackoverflow and friends? >  > This is going to cause you to hit INT_MAX relatively quickly.  Well part of it would be the current test case of "does anyone care", e.g. do people actually use this/care enough to do the work to assign a CVE, if someone wants to spend their time being the CNA for stackoverflow and put out good CVEs I'm fine with that.  >  >  > khm >   --   Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
