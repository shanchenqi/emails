For stackoverflow and other sites in the stack exchange network I think your time would be better spent downvoting answers and adding a comment along the lines of:      -1: This answer uses [foo which is insecure](link) and should use     [bar which is safe](link) instead to protect against [attack     name](link).  That way it will be visible in the same spot as the incorrect answer, let the person who answered the question know they made a mistake, let the person who asked the question know there was a mistake, and provide a notice to the future about both what's wrong and what's better.  If it gets hidden because there's already too many comments, then get a pal to upvote your comment to make it more likely to be visible by default.  Upvote any answers without security problems. If there's no correct answers, then provide a correct answer at the same time for extra credit.
