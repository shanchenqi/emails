Our fuzzing tools recently found a heap buffer overflow in the request parsing code that can be triggered remotely. The patch was recently fixed [2], and the bug was introduced in [3].  It seems that it's also affecting thttpd present in OpenSUSE [4].  Let us know if you need more information.  Thanks Alex from ForAllSecure  [1] https://github.com/blueness/sthttpd [2] [3] [4]   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
