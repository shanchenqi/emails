TL;DR: tcsh will not lose functionality if TIOCSTI is gone.  tcsh uses TIOCSTI in the editor e_stuff_char() function which is unbound by default; not many people know about this or use it. There is also the old FILEC code from csh (that used TIOCSTI to do file completion with <ESC>), but that is not compiled in. I should remove it but it is kept there merely for nostalgia :-)  One can be much stricter though about who is allowed to use TIOCSTI like I've done for NetBSD (require exact credentials match on the tty). For example the typical example of root running an unprivileged installer on NetBSD fails:  # cat installer #!/bin/sh whoami /usr/sbin/sti /dev/tty whoami\\n  # su unprivileged -c ./installer unprivileged sti: Cannot simulate terminal input: Operation not permitted # whoami root  christos  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
