And it turn out that since rkhunter is in bash, it parse the file as bash.  So adding something like:  mirror=$(sleep  in the file result into "rkhunter --update" doing this:  \_ /bin/sh /usr/bin/rkhunter --update \_ /bin/sh /usr/bin/rkhunter --update \_ sleep  It also :nd on a few packages (if not all), rkhunter --update is run by cron, as root, so without much limitation.  Upstream have been warned 2 months ago, and I also did warned RH product security, who assigned  to it.  Unfortunaly, half of the upstream developpers seems to have disappeared and the software is in maintenance mode, so no fix is avaliable yet, except "turn off mirror update". Upstream told me to publish it, but I didn't found time earlier.   --  Michael Scherer  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
