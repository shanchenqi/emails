I  really doubt it for GCC for a variety of reasons.  Hell, I doubt I could have gotten even a good discussion going about the problems with -fstack-check without the details of the embargo'd CVE.  Even if I was able to get interest from other key GCC contributors, the level of detail I'd have to disclose to those key contributors to make progress would likely have violated the embargo.  Perhaps part of the difference is OpenBSD can move fairly independently while something like GCC requires larger scale coordination and public discussion.
