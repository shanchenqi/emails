I don't know about apple itself but in the clusterfuzz reports I see 4 public  bugs about sqlite. However they have a very small (2 days) range of regression, i.e. a commit  made in those two days causes the problem. I didn't check, but I suspect they didn't go in any release.  FTR, the time you are seeing in the regression range is UTC:  At this point I don't know if apple referer to those issues or the mentioned  issues are not public.  --  Agostino Sarubbo Gentoo Linux Developer  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
