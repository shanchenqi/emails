I was wrong.  I now found that they posted two messages in January and August but that's all.  There was also some participation here on oss-security, and IIRC previously on vendor-sec.  > Being a user of the info > only, without participation in discussions, is not strictly disallowed, > but this time it's coupled with lack of response when specifically asked > to respond, and on an issue that is at least potentially relevant to the > distros (not just a responsiveness test).  On a related note, I think we should continue to allow distros with just one representative subscribed.  Some projects are genuinely small (which doesn't mean their userbase is proportionally small) - e.g., Slackware. Some have tiny security teams (even one-person) or few people who actually do stuff.  This does mean they will miss tests if that person is e.g. on vacation.  This also means they will occasionally miss real issues (non-tests), and not only on the distros list.  But this doesn't fully disqualify them.  In fact, currently I am a single point of failure for many aspects of running the distros list.  Maybe I need to address that, but it's tricky to do without adding risks.  Maybe it's more reasonable to require some participation - e.g., if you commented during the embargo period negotiation, that would have demonstrated you care.  Even if you said e.g. that you defer to others. Noise?  Not exactly.  Not when such feedback was explicitly requested by the reporter, and they got very few responses.  (Here "you" can refer to any distro, especially one with otherwise little observable activity.)
