Ok so I tested it, no crash/huge memory thing, but the CPU got maxed and even when I closed the tab for the image Firefox kept eating CPU, I wasn't able to close Firefox, had to use the kill command (which worked fine) so this clearly falls into the DoS camp and may need a CVE, has Mozilla commented on why they have elected to NOT give it a CVE?  --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com    Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
