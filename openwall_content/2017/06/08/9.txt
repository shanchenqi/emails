I just checked a fix for one of those into Firefox yesterday.  It wasn't considered a serious problem because the malloc would eventually fail safely, but it's better to predict the problem ahead of time and not even try to malloc all available memory.  See in which a tiny PNG file tries to claim Gigabytes of memory.
