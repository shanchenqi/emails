Memory allocation failures are normal since there are always finite  memory resources and requests may be based on the amount of work to be  performed.  If a memory allocation failure can be unreasonably induced  (e.g. a byte input file consumes GB of memory) and the  impacted software (or whole system) is expected to remain running  continually in order to provide service for many users, then there  would be a denial of service opportunity, which could be serious.
