I think Kurt's words "without OpenBSD present, due to them breaking the embargo" are Kurt's (and maybe others') impression only (and maybe these people's personal decision(s) not to inform OpenBSD going forward, as Kurt mentioned he did help ping OpenBSD this time when Qualys wasn't getting a response from them in early May).  No decision on the distros list at large was made to either inform or not inform OpenBSD of further issues.  As it happened, we did CC the discussion around Cron to Todd (although like I said in my posting about Cron in here, there was no point in having that minor issue embargoed in the first place).  The glibc issues and fixes are most likely irrelevant to *BSD libc's - in fact, we should have been more careful not to spam the full distros list with them (I think some sub-threads correctly went to linux-distros only, but some did not).
