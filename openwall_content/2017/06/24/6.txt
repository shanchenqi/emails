In cases like this, please also quote at least the most essential portion of the content you're referring to, which is:  "CZ.NIC has released Knot DNS and Knot DNS Beside several fixes and improvements, these versions fix a flaw within the TSIG protocol implementation that would allow an attacker with a valid key name and algorithm to bypass the TSIG authentication if no additional ACL restrictions is set.
