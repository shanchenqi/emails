Did you try to tell KSPP guys to stop their work( cc'ing kernel-hardening mailinglist)? It's so obvious to see the most security work( more than just a specific OS) originally done by PaX/Grsecurity:   And my customers has been suffering from your philosophical ideas of "A bug is bug" for too long. I really respect your contributions( linux kernel/git) to the FLOSS world. But even the open source king can't change the truth:   btw: You didn't answer Brad's question.
