Quite frankly, I'd much rather see *you* actually send in patches that are acceptable for inclusion, something you've never done.  As it is, other people have tried to clean up parts of the grsecurity patches, and tried to make them acceptable.  Wouldn't it be nice if you actually tried to make the baseline actually better?  Please.                  Linus  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
