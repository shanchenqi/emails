The messages appearing on distros should be strictly a subset of those appearing on linux-distros, as per the description of the lists here:  http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros  As you may notice, the Subject lines sometimes contain [vs] and other times [vs-plain].  This reflects whether the messages traveled to the list exploder in encrypted or plaintext form, respectively.  They traveled to the list members in re-encrypted form either way.  The [vs-plain] case commonly occurs on messages CC'ed to other parties, for which the sender might not have had the keys.  MUAs generally don't allow a message to be encrypted to a subset of the addressees and sent in plaintext to others.  Enjoy.
