Technically, we can easily extract and make public the message Subjects.  For full messages, we need a way to mass-decrypt an mbox containing PGP/MIME messages.  Maybe I should list implementing a program that would do that(*) as one of the options that a new distros list member could choose as their contribution back to the community.  (*) Mutt hack maybe?  Mutt processes those messages great, so having it output them in decrypted form into another mbox and automatically loop over all messages in the input mbox might do the trick.
