Are you delusional?  Sorry, you don't get to weasel your way out of  calling us clowns, that our code is garbage, with this weak reply where  you can pretend you didn't just say those things and now would love for  us to provide our "garbage" code directly.  Also you might be in  confusion as to the extent to which KSPP is "cleaning up" parts of our  code -- they're definitely introducing bugs and renaming variables.   Other than that, they have a tendency to misrepresent the source of  their ideas, so I can understand the cause of your confusion.  This, for  instance:  was simply someone realizing we had updated the code they previously  copy+pasted, and copy+pasted the newer version.  He is being funded to  do this.  He even emailed me for help figuring out the code he was being paid to copy+paste.  Wouldn't it be nice if you didn't demand free work of us in our free  time? We publicly gave permission for any company involved in the KSPP  to publish the private details of any supposed offers made to us,  including any financial terms.  No such offers have ever materialized in  public, I wonder why that is?  Until you acknowledge the KSPP is business competition dreamed up by  Google, who made a conscious decision somewhere higher up in the company  than Kees to compete with us instead of cooperating with us, there is no  negotiation. You thought you'd get away with it by being able to  continue using our own test patches against us, and now look at the mess  you've all created.  How many dozens of incompetent people are you going  to fund full time to avoid getting help from the people with real  knowledge?  Linux's technical debt is only going to increase, and when  the KSPP contributors veer into original idea territory (which they're  soon going to have to do a lot more of), the results make Linux look as  dumb as OpenBSD preventing NOP-sliding into ROP gadgets.  If you really wanted our help, you would know how to get it -- we've posted about it publicly (and I'll publish it here too for the record if this mail is allowed through despite being totally off-topic and non-technical): 1) Forget 'bugs are bugs' 2) Stop obfuscating commit messages 3) Actually put someone (or someones) in charge of security, start having actual responsibility instead of pretending you guys are just doing the work in your free time.  If Jon Corbet has to submit a fix himself, something is clearly broken. 4) Have a basic level of respect 5) Fund our work so that we have the free time to help out.  As it stands, any time spent helping takes away from our own work (which becomes the security of Linux a decade from now, quite literally).  It's that simple, but you (collectively) seem to be unwilling to do any of the above.  -Brad  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
