Gday,  David Howells has written a great description, so rather than reword what he's written here is a quote directly from the git commit.  >From the patch notes:  ---     When a kerberos 5 ticket is being decoded so that it can be loaded into an     rxrpc-type key, there are several places in which the length of a     variable-length field is checked to make sure that it's not going to     overrun the available data - but the data is padded to the nearest     four-byte boundary and the code doesn't check for this extra.  This could     lead to the size-remaining variable wrapping and the data pointer going     over the end of the buffer.      Fix this by making the various variable-length data checks use the padded     length. ---  >From what I can see, this could leak 3 bytes of memory to userspace or possibly corrupt 3 bytes of memory,  Upstream fix  Red Hat Bugzilla:  --   Wade Mealing  Product Security - Kernel, RHCE  Red Hat  <https://www.redhat.com>  wmealing@...hat.com <https://red.ht/sig> TRIED.
