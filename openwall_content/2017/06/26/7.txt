And before I get accused of censorship I would point out I'm not wanting to stop anyone from talking, I'm only wanting to stop people from talking in a way that is so rude and insulting that it poisons the community and scares people away. I assume Solar also supports this (if not... ergh. that's gonna be an awkward conversation).
