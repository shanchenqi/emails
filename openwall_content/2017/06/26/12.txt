So as per the private email thread we had previously I'm not going to be interacting with you beyond what is strictly neccesary for CVE and other professional purposes.  One the CVE REJECT side, looks legitimate, although I'm inclined to agree with Qualys and REJECT it so that you stop emailing. I did contact MITRE, I haven't had time to reply to them yet (they are also wondering why the CVE needs REJECT'ing), as such I think it may be best to recuse myself from this specific CVE and let you handle this with MITRE. I have also previously told you how to go about doing this.  I will say that CVE identifiers doesn't just cover full code execution flaws, but also covers situations where for example a security property is claimed but is not as effective as we thought (e.g. the stackguard page size in this case). Many CVE's are not fully exploitable on their own but are part of an exploit chain.   > > cheers, >  PaX Team >  --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com    Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
