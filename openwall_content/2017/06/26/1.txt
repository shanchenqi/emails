Thank you very much!  Thank you!  We didn't have a specific policy on exploit publication, but for further occasions I've just added this clarification to:  http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros  "If you shared exploit(s) that are not an essential part of the issue description, then at your option you may slightly delay posting them to oss-security but you must post the exploits to oss-security within at most 7 days of making the mandatory posting above.  If you exercise this option, you have two mandatory postings to make: first with a sufficiently detailed issue description (as requested above) and with an announcement of your intent to post the exploits separately (please mention exactly when), and second with the exploits - or indeed you could have included the exploits right away, in your first and only mandatory posting."  The decision to wait for fixes in major distros that almost certainly do intend to release fixes makes sense to me.  I haven't found a good way to specify it as part of policy yet.  For now, we may plan to be not as strict at enforcing the above addition to the policy as I intend to be at enforcing the main policy of max 14 days for issue detail (possibly excluding exploits).  Specifically, occasional well-reasoned exceptions where exploits may be posted later than in 7 days may be made - or maybe we simply need to relax the "at most 7 days" requirement, replacing it with a higher maximum and a 7 days guideline.  Regardless, since this will be for already-public issues, we'll be able to discuss any such exceptions or policy changes in public as well - here on oss-security.
