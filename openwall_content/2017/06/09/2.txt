Bugzilla is a bug tracker. Many projects use it. There's litterally hundreds of "Bugzilla sites" and nobody of us has a clue which one you're referring to. And even if we did, probably only the admin of that site could help you.  > When an anonymous user accesses the page, the following message is displayed and access is blocked. >  > "You are not authorized to access bug To see this bug, you must first log in to an account with the appropriate permissions"  [...]  > If you have a solution, let me know.  Here's an idea: Try to log in to an account with the appropriate permissions.  If your bug reports are as fuzzy and confused as your posting on this mailing list, it's no wonder your requests got ignored. You really could try to be more specific and/or precise. A real name would also increase chances of not being mistaken for a troll.
