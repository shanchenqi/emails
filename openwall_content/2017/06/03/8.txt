That's my assessment too - "not completely unproductive".  > And no I'm not going to be civil if  That's a problem.  Please do try to be civil no matter what.  If you're deliberately not being civil when you post in here, that's a reason for me as a moderator to start rejecting your messages.  And to make it clear: no reply is expected to this message, nor to anything else in this thread.  Let's end the thread right here.  Thanks!
