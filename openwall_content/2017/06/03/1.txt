Product name? Product version? 2) What is the problem type? (in some cases we accept "unknown" but you better have a reproducer that does something nasty like crash the system or execute code) 3) A description of the issue (which includes affected software. problem type and ideally the impact) 4) A reference URL, and I know the DWF will accept URL's that don't exist yet as long as you are trustworthy (e.g. "we will post the advisory at URL X"), typically for open source something like a link to the issue or the affected code is more than sufficient.  So yes, you can ask for a CVE well before you commit a fix (and in some cases before you even fully understand the issue).
