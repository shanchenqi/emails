Notably it is used by libreoffice.  I reported two heap overflows in april. The bug reports are private  Both are fixed by the same commit:  I also informed the libreoffice security team.  No new release has been made yet. I'm pasting the content of my bug reports below, poc files attached.   ---------------------- heap buffer overflow in raptor_qname_format_as_xml Description	The attached file will cause a heap buffer overflow in raptor. Can be tested with the rapper command line tool.  This is a security bug, so I'm marking this private.  Here's a stack trace of the crash (from address sanitizer): AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address at pc bp sp WRITE of size 8 at thread T0     #0 in raptor_qname_format_as_xml     #1 in raptor_xml_writer_start_element_common     #2 in raptor_xml_writer_start_element     #3 in raptor_rdfxml_start_element_grammar     #4 in raptor_rdfxml_start_element_handler     #5 in raptor_sax2_start_element     #6 in xmlParseStartTag     #7     #8 in xmlParseChunk     #9 in raptor_sax2_parse_chunk     #10 in raptor_rdfxml_parse_chunk     #11 in raptor_parser_parse_chunk     #12 in raptor_parser_parse_file_stream     #13 in raptor_parser_parse_file     #14 in main     #15 in __libc_start_main     #16 in _start   ------------------  heap buffer overflow in raptor_xml_writer_start_element_common Description	The attached file will cause a heap buffer overflow and crash raptor. This was found via fuzzing with the tool american fuzzy lop.  This is a security bug, so I'm marking it private.
