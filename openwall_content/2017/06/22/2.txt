That would be a *lot* easier than it was to set it up for the main thread stack. It follows the main thread stack rlimit as a guideline so it seems to make sense to use the same guard region size too. If it ends up exposed as a sysctl, it could read the current value from there.  For the local setuid/setgid/setcap binary attack surface, the main thread stack is most relevant, but in general many cases of large stack frames that were found are called in threads other than the initial one. Secondary stacks are also mixed in with other mmap allocations rather than having a separate ASLR base and glibc doesn't do any secondary stack ASLR. IIRC, it does cache color the stacks but not randomly and I don't remember how much space it currently reserves for that.
