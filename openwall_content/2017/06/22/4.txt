Heck, I've tracked down embargoed security issues just from what multiple closed source vendors documented in their release notes.  :My take on the embargoing process (outside of what's already mentioned :on https://grsecurity.net/an_ancient_kernel_hole_is_not_closed.php ): :I've always been concerned by the fact that smaller distros seem to  :be barred from distros-list membership; it seems the arrangement  :lends itself too much to enabling the marketing of the larger  :companies and in fact perhaps even disincentivizing their investment  :in security as the embargo process enables them to skirt much of the  :public pain they'd otherwise have to experience (for in this  :instance what was a completely avoidable problem).  I get the practical :reasons for the policy (increased leak risk, major distros often do :the actual fixing work, etc) but from a level of principle it's always :rubbed me the wrong way.  In the past, I've proposed that the embargo mailing list archives themselves have an "embargo", after which they become public.  That way, there's after-the-fact transparency, and it gives the folks who care a good idea of what happened.  Is there anything sensitive at this point in, say, the March linux-distros archives??     -Mike  --   Michael J.
