Reports of EOL versions being vulnerable were greatly exaggerated. Only versions through are actually vulnerable. Other versions allow TLS resumption and skip inner authentication but they change their mind and refuse access at the last moment. (I accept full responsibility for this fiasco and as an act of penance I have reexamined and retested every single FreeRADIUS release since  2. The attribution of the discovery to Stefan Winter was wrong. Further inquiry into this matter has revealed the vulnerability was reported "back in February" but the true identity of a person who reported it remains unknown. (Stefan reported a different problem with session resumption in early March and those two issues might have become conflated but that is purely my speculation.)  Enclosed below is the corrected advisory. The timeline has been extended to cover the complete history of the vulnerability.  -----   Vendor: The FreeRADIUS Project  Product: FreeRADIUS server   Affected Versions:  2.x (EOL): through  3.0.x (stable): All versions before  3.1.x and 4.0.x (development): All versions before   Description:  The implementation of TTLS and PEAP in FreeRADIUS skips inner authentication when it handles a resumed TLS connection. This is a feature but there is a critical catch: the server must never allow resumption of a TLS session until its initial connection gets to the point where inner authentication has been finished successfully.  Unfortunately, affected versions of FreeRADIUS fail to reliably prevent resumption of unauthenticated sessions unless the TLS session cache is disabled completely and allow an attacker (e.g. a malicious supplicant) to elicit EAP Success without sending any valid credentials.   Mitigation:  (a) Disable TLS session caching. Set enabled = no in the cache subsection of eap module settings (raddb/mods-enabled/eap in the standard v3.0.x-style layout).  (b) Upgrade to version   Credits:  It is not known who was the first to discover this vulnerability.  Luboš Pavlíček of the University of Economics, Prague independently rediscovered it in April   Timeline:  Version released. It was the first version supporting TTLS session resumption/PEAP fast reauthentication.  Vulnerability introduced (commit  Version released.  Version released.  Vulnerability fixed (commit  Version released.  Vulnerability reintroduced in v3.0.x branch (commit  Version released.  early February Vulnerability discovered (or rediscovered?) and reported by an unknown person.  The first (and mostly ineffective) attempt to fix the vulnerability in v3.0.x branch (commits and  Vulnerability fixed in v3.1.x and v4.0.x branches (commits and respectively).  Version released without any explicit indication that it was supposed to fix a serious vulnerability (but it was probably better that way because the vulnerability was not really fixed).  Vulnerability rediscovered by Luboš Pavlíček.  PoC exploit developed and used to confirm is still vulnerable. Vulnerability reported... again.  The second (and hopefully final) attempt to fix the vulnerability in v3.0.x (commits and  Version released.
