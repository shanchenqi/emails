Smart fuzzing revealed Crypto++'s Zinflate class, used by classes like Gunzip and Inflator, could perform an out-of-bounds read when decompressing data.  The out-of-bounds read occurs on a table with 30 elements. The table is static and its storage is allocated in initialized memory. The attacker can craft a ZIP file that allows a read of the last two non-existent elements. We believe an attacker can only read 0-bytes due to the storage allocation. We were not able to escalate it to a write. We believe its a low risk finding.  We were not able to induce failures in other classes using the techniques. Other classes include those that are related, like compressors; and those which are unrelated, like public and private keys.  The issue is being tracked by the library at The Gentoo folks assigned to track the issue.  The fix is available in Master. It is also available for several versions of the library at .
