I know some of you are actually helping with > these, but I'd prefer that you explicitly take responsibility for them.  I didn't volunteer for the things that I've already done on occasion. Since I'm on the west coast of the united states and tend to sleep in and work late (and spend entirely too much time in mutt already) I'm often the first to spot new postings to the list if made during a few hour window.  In those hours I'll let people know their post made it through the list. (This is common practice on the list since the anti-spam setup just drops mails that lack [vs] or [vs-plain] in the Subject: line. Frequent posters who aren't subscribed know to look for confirmation mails from list readers to see if their posts made it through and re-send if they don't get a reply.)  But this window really only works a few hours each day, a few days each week. If I _sign up_ for this task, the other hours each week would get worse.  Communally shared tasks have felt fine to me so far. Yes they often fall to you, but not always. And if you weren't always attached to your MUA, perhaps it wouldn't always fall to you either. :)  Thanks  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
