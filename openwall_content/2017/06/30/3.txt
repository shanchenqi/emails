The vulnerabilities are very similar to the knot one (no CVE yet) found by the same researchers (Synaktiv):  An error in TSIG authentication can permit unauthorized zone transfers  An attacker who is able to send and receive messages to an authoritative DNS server and who has knowledge of a valid TSIG key name may be able to circumvent TSIG authentication of AXFR requests via a carefully constructed request packet. A server that relies solely on TSIG keys for protection with no other ACL protection could be manipulated into:  * providing an AXFR of a zone to an unauthorized recipient * accepting bogus NOTIFY packets  An error in TSIG authentication can permit unauthorized dynamic updates  An attacker who is able to send and receive messages to an authoritative DNS server and who has knowledge of a valid TSIG key name for the zone and service being targeted may be able to manipulate BIND into accepting an unauthorized dynamic update.
