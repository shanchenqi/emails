It contains the following code:      if java -d32 2>&1 | grep "does not support" > /dev/null; then     ...  On 32-bit systems, this causes java to print the help message.  --  Jakub Wilk  View attachment "launcher_en.java" of type "text/x-java" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
