Mitigation: 2.2.x users should either apply the patch available at or upgrade in the future to which is currently unreleased.  2.4.x users should upgrade to  Third-party module writers SHOULD use ap_get_basic_auth_components(), available in and instead of ap_get_basic_auth_pw(). Modules which call the legacy ap_get_basic_auth_pw() during the authentication phase MUST either immediately authenticate the user after the call, or else stop the request immediately with an error response, to avoid incorrectly authenticating the current request.
