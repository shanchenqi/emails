More specifically, this should be (and does indeed seem to be) the permissions of the file being edited, masked by the user's umask - so that if have a loose umask and I edit a secret file, the swap file doesn't leak its contents.  ~/tmp/vim% umask ~/tmp/vim% ls -Al total 4 -rw------- 1 smcv smcv 8 Nov  1 secret-file ~/tmp/vim% gvim secret-file ~/tmp/vim% ls -Al total 16 -rw------- 1 smcv smcv Nov  1 .secret-file.swp -rw------- 1 smcv smcv     8 Nov  1 secret-file  A more naive implementation might have created .secret-file.swp with -rw-r--r-- permissions according to my umask, but that would have been bad.
