I do see that tiff2bw  made no attempt to release any memory at all (not strictly required  for a utility since memory is released when it quits).  I have  modified the code in the development CVS version to release memory to  satisfy memory checkers.  > > Use  This is a memory-based DOS issue within tiff2bw itself (not directly  inside libtiff).  TIFF files using LZW compression can achieve a very  high compression ratio so it can be difficult to predict if a file's  pixel dimensions are bogus or not.  Valid files also pose a DOS  opportunity.  There are no arbitrary limits imposed within tiff2bw.
