Please note that CVE can cover a memory leak within a library (such as any file in the subdirectory), but cannot cover a memory leak in a command-line program. Therefore, please omit reports about a memory leak affecting tools/tiff2bw.c or a different tools/*.c file.   > [Suggested description] > In PCRE > after compiling, a pcretest load test PoC produces a crash overflow > in the function match() in pcre_exec.c because of a self-recursive call. >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Vulnerability Type] > Buffer Overflow >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Vendor of Product] > Perl Compatible Regular Expressions >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Affected Product Code Base] > PCRE - >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Affected Component] > file:pcre_exec.c > function match() line and line >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Attack Type] > Local >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Impact Denial of Service] > true >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Attack Vectors] > A crash file >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Discoverer] > ZHANG JIAWANG from cncert  Use   > [Suggested description] > LibTIFF has multiple memory leak vulnerabilities, which allow > attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption), as demonstrated > by tif_open.c, tif_lzw.c, and tif_aux.c >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Additional Information] > /tiff2bw > LZWDecode: Not enough data at scanline 0 (short bytes). > /usr/local/bin/llvm-symbolizer: no version information available (required by /usr/local/bin/llvm-symbolizer) >  > ================================================================= > LeakSanitizer: detected memory leaks >  > Direct leak of byte(s) in 1 object(s) allocated from: >     #0 in __interceptor_malloc >     #1 in main >     #2 in __libc_start_main >  > Direct leak of byte(s) in 1 object(s) allocated from: >     #0 in __interceptor_malloc >     #1 in TIFFClientOpen >  > Indirect leak of byte(s) in 1 object(s) allocated from: >     #0 in __interceptor_malloc >     #1 in LZWSetupDecode >  > Indirect leak of byte(s) in 5 object(s) allocated from: >     #0 in realloc >     #1 in _TIFFCheckRealloc >     #2 in _TIFFCheckMalloc >  > Indirect leak of byte(s) in 2 object(s) allocated from: >     #0 in realloc >     #1 in _TIFFCheckRealloc >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Vendor of Product] > TIFF Library and Utilities >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Affected Product Code Base] > LibTIFF tiff2bw - >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Affected Component] > multi memory leak vulnerabilities in files as tiff2bw.c tif_open.c and so on >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Attack Type] > Local >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Impact Denial of Service] > true >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Attack Vectors] > to open a poc file >  > ------------------------------------------ >  > [Discoverer] > ZHANG JIAWANG from cncert  Use   - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  l9qmqrROzVkGXO9eQLkP =PcOO -----END PGP SIGNATURE----- Content of type "text/html" skipped  Download attachment "pcre_poc.txt" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment "libtiff_poc.tif" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
