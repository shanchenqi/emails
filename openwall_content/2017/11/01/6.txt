I reproduced Kurt's findings on Debian unstable. Vim chmods the swapfile  without honouring umask.  It does seem to keep read permissions of the original file, which is not  the same thing as honouring umask, and which is a rather dubious  behavior, especially when editing files belonging to other users.  >2.

Sounds like a successful (albeit mild) DoS attack to me. But it's worse than that. vim attempts to read the swapfile before  showing you the complaint:  $ mkfifo -m /tmp/.bar.swp $ vim /tmp/bar [hangs forever]  --  Jakub Wilk  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
