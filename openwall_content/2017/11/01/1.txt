Just to clarify: 1. vim creates a swap file applying user's umask.    Tested with vim on ArchLinux and vi on Fedora, if your vim doesn't do that,    the corresponding package is broken. 2. It is totally OK to edit files in /tmp or /dev/shm or /var/tmp.    The described "attack" when someone plants a /tmp/file.swp before another    user edits /tmp/file is not going to work because vim will complain that the    swap file already exists.
