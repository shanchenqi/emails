E.g.:  1) if I have a umask of I'm saying "never create a file that is readable by 'other'" 2) if I have a umask of I'm saying "never create a file that is rwx by 'other'" 3) if I have a umask of I'm saying "never create a file that is rwx by 'group' or 'other'"  A umask of e.g. is NOT saying "create my files with rwxrwx----", it is saying "remove 'rwx' from other when creating a file, I don't really care what you do with user and group permissions"  So programs are free to create files with less permissions, e.g. ssh-keygen, it creates files rw-r-----, minus whatever your umask is, so if you apply a umask of you'll get files with rw-------- which is what you' expect.  --   Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
