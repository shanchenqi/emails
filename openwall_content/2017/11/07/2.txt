We have seen various file types during testing since a long time that should not have been web served and compiled a list [1] of those:  .dot files in general. In particular:  .ht*  .DS_Store  .git*  .svn* .pkcs12 .pfx .p12, .pem, .key, .der, .crt *.log *.swp *.bp/*.bak /^~/ or /~$/ *.dmp/*.core thumbs.db/*.db *.raw *.sqlite *.conf/*.ini *.txt/*.csv  However, I also fully agree with the comments later in the thread that this issue should mainly be addressed by strict operating standards for production systems as well as deployment procedures.
