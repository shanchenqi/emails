I thought the long embargo periods were correct and assumed that was because of inclusion of pre-distros time, but according to what you're saying these are just two errors.  > that said, for > there was some missing data for first publication (it > is public through > and > since 9th), so the publication > time is days (although not for oss-security posting).  Your statistics appear to suggest that it was public on oss-security exactly 22 days later, but actually it was public on oss-security at most a day later with:   I guess you'll correct this.  If you ever notice an embargo period exceeding 14 days, please investigate and either correct whatever error you might have or sound the alarm.  This shouldn't be happening.  Thanks!

This currently shows some fields as empty, including but not only for where I think you could add the missing info easily.  Please do.
