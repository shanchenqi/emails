Please, accept my apologies.  > I hate to ask, but why are you getting CVEs for bugs fixed over a year > ago, and are already in all stable kernel releases a year ago?  Why does > it matter?  I'm afraid, you won't like the answer, but in a short word, the Red Hat is a CNA (CVE Numbering Authority) for Red Hat's products and the Linux kernel and we've decided to assign this CVE.
