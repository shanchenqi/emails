So the answer is just "we've decided to", right?  If so, that's fine, you are allowed to do so being a CNA, but what is keeping you from doing the same for the thousands of other bugs that have been fixed since this one that is in a specific Red Hat product?  It's the arbitrarily nature here that I am curious about, it feels like it should be "all or nothing", for CVEs to mean much here.  Right now it seems like it is just, "all that we care to track"?  :)  thanks,  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
