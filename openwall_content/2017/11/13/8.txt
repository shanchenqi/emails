This lists two very long embargo periods for two Linux kernel issues: 96 days for and 28 days for  While this is useful info, it does not reflect (linux-)distros' lists performance as it includes embargo periods from prior to disclosure to those lists. Also, we can't reliably know of such prior embargo periods, so our data would be inconsistent, which is especially bad for calculating averages.  I think for our statistics collection, we should primarily use embargo periods since disclosure to (linux-)distros' lists, and secondarily since the possibly earlier embargo start dates when known (like you did now).  Can you add such data?  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
