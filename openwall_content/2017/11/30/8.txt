A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this to cause the broker to exhaust all available memory and eventually terminate. Older AMQP protocols are not affected.  Resolution:  Users who have AMQP 1.0 support enabled (default) should upgrade their Qpid Broker-J to version or later.  Mitigation:  If upgrading the broker is not possible, users can choose to disable AMQP 1.0 by either setting the system property "qpid.plugin.disabled:protocolenginecreator.AMQP_1_0" to "true", excluding "AMQP_1_0" from the supported protocol list on all AMQP ports, or by removing the AMQP 1.0 related jar files from the Java classpath.
