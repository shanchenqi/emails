ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Failure to recognize errors being returned from low level functions in Populate on Demand (PoD) code may result in higher level code entering an infinite loop.  IMPACT ======  A malicious HVM guest can cause one pcpu to permanently hang.  This normally cascades into the whole system freezing, resulting in a a host Denial of Service (DoS).  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen versions from 3.4.x onwards are affected.  Only x86 systems are vulnerable.  ARM is not vulnerable.  x86 PV VMs cannot leverage the vulnerability.  Only systems with 2MiB or 1GiB HAP pages enabled are vulnerable.  The vulnerability is largely restricted to HVM guests which have been constructed in Populate-on-Demand mode (i.e. with memory < maxmem):  x86 HVM domains without PoD (i.e. started with memory == maxmem, or without mentioning "maxmem" in the guest config file) also cannot leverage the vulnerability, in recent enough Xen versions:   4.8.x and later: all versions safe if PoD not configured   4.7.x: and later safe if PoD not configured   4.6.x: and later safe if PoD not configured   4.5.x: and later safe if PoD not configured   4.4.x and earlier: all versions vulnerable even if PoD not configured  The commit required to prevent this vulnerability when PoD not configured is   xen/physmap: Do not permit a guest to populate PoD pages for itself and the corresponding backports.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only PV guests will avoid this issue.  Running HVM guests only in non-PoD mode (maxmem == memory) will also avoid this issue.  NOTE: In older releases of Xen, an HVM guest can create PoD entries itself; so this mitigation will not be effective.  Specifying "hap_1gb=0 hap_2mb=0" on the hypervisor command line will avoid the vulnerability.  Alternatively, running all x86 HVM guests in shadow mode will also avoid this vulnerability.  (For example, by specifying "hap=0" in the xl domain configuration file.)  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Julien Grall of Linaro.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            xen-unstable       Xen 4.9.x, Xen 4.8.x       Xen 4.7.x, Xen 4.6.x, Xen 4.5.x  $    $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators, with ONE exception:  Removing the ability to boot in populate-on-demand mode is NOT permitted during the embargo on public cloud systems.  This is because doing so might alert attackers to the nature of the vulnerability. Deployment of this mitigation is permitted only AFTER the embargo ends.  Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
