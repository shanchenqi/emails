Does Linus, Greg, Al, etc, etc, etc owe anyone anything? Yes, they're  time is paid by companies and/or the Linux Foundation, but do those orgs  have a responsibility to anyone? They're working incredibly hard on  probably one of the most difficult project management feats anyone could  attempt, which anyone can take the end results of, and use without  monetary cost. Linus has the right to treat security in whatever way he  wishes to, according to his own personal philosophy, ultimately it is  his project and he answers to no-one other than himself.  You say everyone on this list is taking on this "responsibility". So  what? Some are making a living or business out of that. Maybe it is  right that the "community" sifts through all the bug fixes and  identifies issues that have a security impact. Kernel development is  hard enough, someone committing a fix has already done a lot of work. Do  they have an obligation to do the extra thinking and documenting in the  commit log in order to identify how someone might maliciously take  advantage of a flaw? It seems we have a whole industry of people who are  good at that, so why shouldn't that industry take on that task? Would  you, Brad, be in business with your product if the kernel people handled  security perfectly? I have nothing against grsecurity and your efforts,  I see no harm in companies making a business out of kernel security.  > Vladis' original mail made it clear the bug was > already fixed with the included upstream fix link, so your > follow-up was unnecessary.  I don't see a problem on this list with too many people making  unnecessary, frivolous contributions. If you feel your rant was worthy  of being posted, then I'd say Greg's comments, which were polite and  without a hint of vitriol, were also worthy of contribution. I think you  should leave it up to the moderator who does a good job of supervising  this list, rather than suggesting that anyone's comments are unnecessary.  > If you truly believe there is no uniqueness to security bugs, I > would advise you to shut down security@...nel.org.  Regardless of what anyone at the top of the kernel project may have said  in the past, I think the reality shows that kernel people on the whole  take security relatively seriously. After all, nearly everyone involved  is a user as well as a developer, and I don't think any of them would  seriously claim to not have any concerns about their own boxen getting  compromised. Yes, there is room for improvement, and reaction to  individual security issues can be debated, but it is unfair to  characterise the kernel community as not caring at all about security.  Personally I see a lot of examples of kernel people genuinely making  efforts to make the kernel more secure, and very few (by comparison),  isolated cases of issues being dismissed, or security impact being  downplayed. I'm sure examples can be dragged up from the past involving  prominent people.  But I've seen plenty of evidence of a genuine desire  (even on the part of Linus himself, in what he writes in commit logs) to  make the kernel more secure, not less.  >  I would also > ask that you come up with a better solution to the problem than > demanding people run the latest version of Linux.

Regardless of what anyone might *say*, the reality is that there is no  reason for anyone to feel compelled to run the very latest kernel in  order to stay secure. The list of kernels receiving regular backported  fixes is frankly more than is really needed. Greg himself goes above and  beyond in this regard and works incredibly hard in maintaining, at the  time of writing, (unofficially), 4.4, 4.9, and usually with 2  or 3 releases a month each. All branches have well defined projected EOL  dates. If that is not enough, there are other people actively  maintaining 3.2, (though just became EOL), and 4.1! And that  is just the vanilla kernels, when you factor in distro kernels with  their own kernel teams backporting security fixes, the choice of secure  kernels to run is incredible, we've never had it so good.  > You might want to focus your time on getting your own house in > order instead of constantly pestering the people on this list -- we > work in the trenches and aren't swayed by nonsense arguments that > have no viable solution attached.  I think the kernel community can hardly be characterised as needing to  put its "house in order", that is a gross exaggeration. It's not perfect  and improvemets are needed. I welcome the efforts Greg is making to  improve things, and his efforts to participate here, and I certainly  don't think Brad speaks for everyone, at least not for me.
