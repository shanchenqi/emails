However,  please remember that all the people contributing on this list are  taking on the responsiblity you and the majority of other upstream  developers have abdicated.  We get it, every time there's some bug mentioned on here that  you've already fixed, you want the entire world to know.  Only you  apparently don't want the world to know about the bug at any time  before then. Vladis' original mail made it clear the bug was  already fixed with the included upstream fix link, so your  follow-up was unnecessary.  As I've already demonstrated many  times, there are plenty of vulnerabilities you haven't fixed.  The  reason for that is largely due to the lack of coordinated  recognition of security flaws which comes from the very top of  leadership.  Another is probably that there are just so many flaws,  and it's simply an accepted externality of the Linux development  process.  If you truly believe there is no uniqueness to security bugs, I  would advise you to shut down security@...nel.org.  I would also  ask that you come up with a better solution to the problem than  demanding people run the latest version of Linux. According to my  current records someone taking that advice would be exposed to a  bug that can brick systems that seems nowhere close to resolution,  and one that makes it impossible to run KVM guests on AMD (which went unfixed for 3 months, and the current fix isn't cc'd for stable -- makes me wonder how much testing -rc really gets).  You might want to focus your time on getting your own house in  order instead of constantly pestering the people on this list -- we  work in the trenches and aren't swayed by nonsense arguments that  have no viable solution attached.
