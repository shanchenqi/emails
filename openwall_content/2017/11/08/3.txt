Mitigation: Users on and 2.7.x before should upgrade to or later Users on before should upgrade to or later  Impact: Users may gain access to files that should be protected by HDFS transparent encryption if those files have world readable access permissions and are localized through YARN's localization mechanism in a cluster where YARN has been granted access to all HDFS encryption keys.
