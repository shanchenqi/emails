At this point, I think you have argued pretty effectively that the current POSIX wording does NOT describe existing practice, and therefore that POSIX has a bug.  It may be desirable to have implementations follow the POSIX wording, but I think you are better off FIRST raising this issue with the Austin Group (http://austingroupbugs.net/main_page.php) to get an opinion on what the POSIX folks think.  Even if the POSIX folks declare that the current wording is intentional and that all existing implementations need to be fixed, it is better to involve them up front.  >  > My preference is 1) because I believe the receive queue filtering behavior > to be more useful.

That may be your preference, but I think you should pursue the course of filing a POSIX bug about the mismatch between documentation and existing practice (ie, what you proposed for course 2), whether or not you get any traction in implementing course 1 on a subset of the systems.  --  Eric Blake, Principal Software Engineer Red Hat, Inc.
