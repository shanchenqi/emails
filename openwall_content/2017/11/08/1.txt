Well, I'm working on fixing the "devices do not get updates" issue through other means, so don't just give up on that one just yet :)  As for the "keep track of vulnerabilities", is that what is really happening here?  Why pick a random bug fix from over a year ago for a CVE vs. the other bugfixes in the past few weeks/months?  I'm really curious as to what triggered this specific CVE request that somehow misses the hundreds/thousands of other fixes that land in newer kernel releases?  thanks,  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
