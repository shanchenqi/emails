The following  releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * Jenkins (weekly) * Jenkins (LTS)  Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you find security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  Jenkins stores metadata related to "people", which encompasses actual user  accounts, as well as users appearing in SCM, in directories corresponding  to the user ID on disk. These directories used the user ID for their name  without additional escaping. This potentially resulted in a number of  problems, such as the following: 1. User names consisting of a single forward slash would have their user  record stored in the parent directory; deleting this user deleted all user  records. 2. User names containing character sequences such as .. could be used to  clobber other configuration files in Jenkins. 3. User names could consist of reserved names such as COM (on Windows).  Autocompletion suggestions for text fields were not escaped, resulting in a  persisted cross-site scripting vulnerability if the source for the  suggestions allowed specifying text that includes HTML metacharacters like  less-than and greater-than characters.
