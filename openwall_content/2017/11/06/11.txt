Personally I just prefer the second sequence since first reading `man 2 chroot` over 20 years ago: "This call does not change the current working directory". So all my programs do change it just immediately after chroot()ing. I've even made a Linux kernel patch to force chroot() to do internal chdir("/"), but noone was really interested. Those were the days...  Now, I've simply (and really accidentally, as all I wanted at that time was to boot-up some hardware via PXE) noticed the tftpd server running with "-s" ("secure") parameter without being chroot()ed. This issue did cost me only some time, as that was in a properly isolated VLAN, but I really prefer chroot()ed programs not to leave their subdirectories, so I decided to have a look into the code and the abovequoted piece appeared as the most suspicious for me.  The ${subj} in general and this issue in particular may deserve more thoroughful exploration, but I'm very unlikely to do this in the observable future, but even this notice may save (at least) time to someone else.   --  Alexey V.
