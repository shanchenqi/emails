From his report:      The following program causes a kernel oops:          #include <sys/types.h>     #include <sys/stat.h>     #include <fcntl.h>     #include <sys/ioctl.h>     #include <linux/kvm.h>          main()     {         int fd = open("/dev/kvm", O_RDWR);         ioctl(fd, KVM_CHECK_EXTENSION, KVM_CAP_PPC_HTM);     }          This happens because when using the global KVM fd with     KVM_CHECK_EXTENSION, kvm_vm_ioctl_check_extension() gets     called with a NULL kvm argument, which gets dereferenced     in is_kvmppc_hv_enabled().   The bug was introduced in commit:    ("KVM: PPC: Introduce KVM_CAP_PPC_HTM")  Which was merged into kernel  The fix is now in mainline:    ("KVM: PPC: Fix oops when checking KVM_CAP_PPC_HTM")      cheers  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
