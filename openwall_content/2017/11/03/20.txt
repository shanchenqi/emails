It's strange it's using /var/tmp instead of ~/.cache but at least it can be protected with PAM's per-user isolated directory support rather than relying on it being done securely.  In /etc/security/namespace.conf, for per-user isolated /tmp and /var/tmp:      /tmp     /tmp-inst/     level     /var/tmp /var/tmp-inst/ level  In /etc/pam.d/system-auth:      session   required  pam_namespace.so  Likely also want to mount /tmp-inst as tmpfs if /tmp was tmpfs rather than just using the root directory pam will create.
