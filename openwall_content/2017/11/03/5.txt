By default[1], when vim wants to overwrite the file "foo", it does:     rename("foo", "foo~")                   = 0    open("foo", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC|O_LARGEFILE, = 3  There's a race window between the two syscalls when the attacker could  re-create "foo", and then vim would happily write to it.  Is this the attack you meant?  NB, vim disables this behavior for files in /tmp (but not /var/tmp)[2].
