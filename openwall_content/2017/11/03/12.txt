In general, what vim does (copying mode bits) in not enough to ensure  that the swapfile is readable only by the users who had access to the  original file. It would have to copy also group ownership and ACLs.  Also, keep in mind how this thread started. Somebody edited  wp-config.php, which was readable by the web server, of course; then vim  created .wp-config.php.swp with the same-ish permissions, which made the  file readable to the whole (external) world.
