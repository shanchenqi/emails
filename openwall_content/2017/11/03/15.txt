This is not the "only drawback".  Among other things, such configuration fails very badly when network mounts are involved.   - If the swap directory is shared between multiple hosts (e.g., $HOME    is NFS-mounted), then you will get false positives when editing files    that happen to share a filename on different hosts.   - If the file being edited is shared between multiple hosts, then you    will get false negatives when trying to edit that file from different    hosts.  Or a combination of the two scenarios.  In the default mode, network mounts basically work as expected because the swapfile location is shared the same way.
