It would have to copy also group ownership and ACLs.  Yes, I am not saying there is no room for improvement here.  > Also, keep in mind how this thread started.

Oops.  I don't buy that argument. There are at least 2 problems here. Someone  misconfiguring his webserver so it does serve dotfiles and secondly  making some last minute changes on a live production server (and  thirdly, the Vim session must have crashed). That sounds more like an  user error. Also the other example about deleting the file that is  currently being edited is not very convincing.  But please, if you really want to change how the swap files are created  please comment here: or anywhere else in that thread starting here: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/vim_dev/sRT9BtjLWMk/Xn_Y3PHlBgAJ  Note, first message needs approval.
