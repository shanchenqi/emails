Also for example if you later delete that file and think you're safe the copy is still floating around world readable. Or you have something indexing the files and ignoring that file type, and the .swp gets indexed, and so on.  --   Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
