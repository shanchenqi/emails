Affected package: ffmpeg Affected versions: <=  FFmpeg could read out of bounds of buffer when it parsing an craft mp4 file.  While ffmpeg calculating “bytestream_end” in ff_init_range_encoder() of libavcodec/rangecoder.c, it uses a small “buf_size”. But when using this structure in read_header() of libavcodec/ffv1dec.c, It will minus a bigger “trailer” than “buf_size” to read “size” through AV_RB24(). So it reads the front memory of “bytestream”, and get an error “size”.  The issue was fixed with the following commit:  Regards  Reported by Zhibin Hu and Yihan Lian from Qihoo GearTeam   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
