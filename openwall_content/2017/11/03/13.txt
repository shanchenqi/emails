It is currently being discussed there (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/vim_dev/sRT9BtjLWMk). Some people are calling for more restrictive permissions on .swp files; however, I believe that using a separate directory for .swp files is the best solution for a multitude of reasons I've discussed here and there. I have refined the vimrc changes that I originally posted (with the help of Christian) and have found appending the following to your vimrc be a decent way to mitigate against all known forms of this attack until a proper patch is released:  " Move the swap file location to protect against " More information at " A big thanks goes to Christian Brabandt (cb@...bit.org) " for helping with this fix. if ! isdirectory("~/.vim/swap/")         silent !install -d -m ~/.vim/swap/ 2>&1 > /dev/null endif set directory=~/.vim/swap//  The only drawback to this approach is that it eliminates the warning when multiple users attempt to edit the same file at the same time; however, this seems preferable to the alternative of being vulnerable.
