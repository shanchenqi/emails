It was co-located with Open Source Summit North America  [2] (previously/including LinuxCon) and the Linux Plumbers Conference  (LPC) [3].  LSS is unique as a security conference as it's dedicated to Linux and Open  Source, and tends to be focused on defensive security engineering.  This year we had refereed presentations, Linux kernel security subsystem  updates, and BoF topics.  The schedule is here:  Slides may be found here: (and in some cases by clicking on the session topics).  There was no video this year, unfortunately, and we'll work on making that  happen for next year.  Also, due to the LPC co-location and schedule overlap, we had no LWN  coverage of the event.  You can find attendee coverage here:   There was also a shared day with LPC (on the 13th), where the TPMs and  containers microconfs were held. See:   It was certainly useful to have so many security-interested Linux folk  there across both conferences, although we will avoid co-locating with LPC  in the future.  It's also useful to have some time between LPC and LSS for  ideas raised at one to be developed further and discussed at the other.  For there will be a new European version of LSS, which will be held  in addition to the main event in North America.  This will be led by Elena  Reshetova, a member of the LSS program committee, who proposed the idea as  there are a lot of Linux and Open Source security folk in Europe who may  not be able to make it to the US event.  Stay tuned for an official  announcement soon (all such announcements can be found at @LinuxSecSummit  on twitter).  In terms of trends, over the past year, we've seen a lot of activity again  in kernel hardening via the kernel self protection project, and you can  see where things are at by looking at Kees' slides:   This work is primarily focused on forward-porting grsecurity/PaX to  mainline, and I gather this will continue to be the case over the next 1-2  years.  One of the most significant effects of the project is more  mainline kernel developers gaining knowledge and skills in security via  involvement in KSPP.  And culturally, there is also now much greater  awareness of contemporary security threats and acceptance of the need to  mitigate them.  Kernel security is hopefully becoming less of a  specialized niche area, and more open to general kernel developers.  We're also seeing continued activity in TPMs (v2.0 stack developoment),  integrity/boot verification, hardware-based mitigations, mobile/device,  and containers.  There are lots of challenges across these areas, and the  materials I've linked from LSS and LPC are a good place to start if you're  interested in where things are at currently.
