The built-in wildcard function has a flaw that makes it not detect the end of the pattern string if it ends with an open bracket (`[`) but instead it will continue reading the heap beyond the end of the URL buffer that holds the wildcard.  For applications that use HTTP(S) URLs, allow libcurl to handle redirects and have FTP wildcards enabled, this flaw can be triggered by malicious servers that can redirect clients to a URL using such a wildcard pattern.  We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.  INFO ----  This bug was introduced in commit May  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name to this issue.  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  - Affected versions: libcurl to and including - Not affected versions: libcurl < and >=  curl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such.  THE SOLUTION ------------  In libcurl version there's a better check for the end of the string. Additionally, the wildcard feature is turned off if the URL passed to libcurl is not using FTP(S), so a redirect to an FTP URL cannot trigger wildcard functionality.  A [patch for is available.  RECOMMENDATIONS ---------------  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:    A - Upgrade curl to version    B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild    C - Do not use `CURLOPT_WILDCARDMATCH` without carfully verifying the       patterns used.  TIME LINE ---------  It was reported to the curl project on November 10,  We contacted distros@...nwall on November 21.  curl was released on November 29 coordinated with the publication of this advisory.  CREDITS -------  Reported by OSS-Fuzz. Researched by Max Dymond. Patch by Daniel Stenberg.
