The internal function `Curl_ntlm_core_mk_ntlmv2_hash` sums up the lengths of the user name + password (= SUM) and multiplies the sum by two (= SIZE) to figure out how large storage to allocate from the heap.  The SUM value is subsequently used to iterate over the input and generate output into the storage buffer. On systems with a 32 bit `size_t`, the math to calculate SIZE triggers an integer overflow when the combined lengths of the user name and password is larger than 2GB bytes). This integer overflow usually causes a very small buffer to actually get allocated instead of the intended very huge one, making the use of that buffer end up in a buffer overrun.  We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.  INFO ----  This bug was introduced in commit April  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name to this issue.  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  This is only an issue on 32 bit systems. It also requires the user and password fields to use more than 2GB of memory combined, which in itself should be rare.  - Affected versions: libcurl to and including - Not affected versions: libcurl < and >=  curl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such.  THE SOLUTION ------------  In libcurl version the integer overflow is avoided.  A [patch for is available.  RECOMMENDATIONS ---------------  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:    A - Upgrade curl to version    B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild    C - Put length restrictions on the user name and passwords you can pass to       libcurl  TIME LINE ---------  It was reported to the curl project on November 6,  We contacted distros@...nwall on November 21.  curl was released on November 29 coordinated with the publication of this advisory.
