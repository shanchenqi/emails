Likewise with patch it tells you that the rejects were saved in a new file.  Editing a file in-place should not create *another* file in the current directory with a different name/suffix. I realize that's subjective, but a lot of (even long time) users will tell you that no way in hell did they expect that to happen. (What's the argument against using a subdirectory of $HOME to store these temporary files?)
