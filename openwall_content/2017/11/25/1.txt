If you telnet to your mail-server on port 25 and issue the EHLO command, and look at the list of SMTP extensions offered, then the CHUNKING extension needs to be listed for you to be vulnerable.  Exim administratively blocks use of the BDAT verb in sessions where the CHUNKING extension was not advertized.  Thus:   chunking_advertise_hosts = is a _complete_ workaround.  On older Exim, the BDAT verb (after MAIL and RCPT) should yield:    unrecognized command  On safe Exim, it should yield:    BDAT command used when CHUNKING not advertised  If you get a 2xx response to BDAT, and you're not using pipelined verbs and confusing the response to the MAIL verb with the response to the BDAT verb, then you haven't disabled CHUNKING.
