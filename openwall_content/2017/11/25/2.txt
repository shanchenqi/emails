Complete with proof-of-concept small Python script.  I've requested CVEs, don't have them yet.  My mail to our announce list:    Remote code execution in the first vulnerability, getting execution as the Exim run-time user.  A complete mitigation is to disable advertising the CHUNKING extension, in which case an attempt to use the BDAT verb should result in:    BDAT command used when CHUNKING not advertised  The instructions I wrote in the mail to our announce-list, were:  } With immediate effect, please apply this workaround: if you are running } Exim or newer is current, is upcoming) then in the main } section of your Exim configuration, set: } }   chunking_advertise_hosts = } } That's an empty value, nothing on the right of the equals. This } disables advertising the ESMTP CHUNKING extension, making the BDAT verb } unavailable and avoids letting an attacker apply the logic.  Chunking support was introduced with Exim the current release is is in RC series now, it looks like a 2-line fix (written by Jeremy Harris) is probably right for the first issue.
