I can try to apply the patch, but I have no idea if it will work, because I don't know which branch or revision it is based on.  By my unscientific counting, there are only 2 other userspace projects which earn CVEs as frequently as QEMU: openjpeg and graphicsmagick.  In both these cases, starting with the message posted here and following the references, I can quickly locate the actual VC commit (in git and mercurial, respectively) and thus have a sound basis for deciding what to do: patch, wait for an updated distro package, or fork the distro package.  Is there a reason why that cannot be done with QEMU?  --  Please don't Cc: me privately on mailing lists and Usenet, if you also post the followup to the list or newsgroup.
