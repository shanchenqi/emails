I can try to apply the | patch, but I have no idea if it will work, because I don't know which | branch or revision it is based on.    Patch is sent against upstream Qemu git repository(below) and is merged  after due review on the -devel list.    -> https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=summary  | By my unscientific counting, there are only 2 other userspace projects which  | earn CVEs as frequently as QEMU: openjpeg and graphicsmagick.

Reviewed patches soon show-up in the above master repository. In this case, it  so happened that an earlier version v1 of the patch was more acceptable    ->  It should make it upstream soon, I'll update here accordingly.
