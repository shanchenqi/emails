I'll write some documentation soon, but you can probably figure out the module layout from looking at the existing ones. Compiling your code must result in a static archive that can be linked to the other objects. If that really is not possible, you must come up with some sort of inter-process communication. Feel free to create a PR for your own module and I'll add it.
