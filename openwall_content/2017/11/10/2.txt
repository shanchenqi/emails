Wheeler  I would like to add that starting in May, companies will have the huge incentive of the European GDPR, with fines going up to 4% annual turnover of the company or group in case of a breach involving EU citizen's data. Here in Switzerland we will have a "light" version with fines capped to CHF. But we're only about 8M (although, including many people and companies in a position to hire lawyers). This makes some incentives already. Now back to the specific question of CVE IDs, it's a tough one, knowing that not everyone might agree on that "single root of trust"... But I would say here, something is way better than nothing!  About the "fraction nearing unity", Linux-specific problem: this is why we are evaluating all possible open-source kernels for a secure "CEuniX"*, in collaboration with two EU-based organizations and a Canadian dev. First results should be published before the May deadline, giving people an early direction to follow in their journey to compliance. Actually this is a turning point - where law exceeds tech - instead of the reverse, which usually happens. Or perhaps better said, the rule of law will soon apply to the digital world, "fully". (Europe is far from being the only one, as was hinted by David; this is an international trend, where cultural differences will come into play and can have a crucial role in shaping how those laws are made and implemented in the real world, ultimately affecting our lives.)
