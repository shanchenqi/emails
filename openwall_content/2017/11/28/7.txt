A non-privileged X client can instruct X server running under root     to open any file by creating own directory with "fonts.dir",     "fonts.alias" or any font file being a symbolic link to any other     file in the system. X server will then open it. This can be issue     with special files such as /dev/watchdog.  --  Matthieu Herrb  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
