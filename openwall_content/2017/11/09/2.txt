Why then can't I find any PDF files on my system with an executable bit set?  Wouldn't it be common for PDFs to be executable in order for this exploit to work?  Why would a PDF, which is a specially formatted data file, be made executable?  I fear there may be one or more misunderstandings at play here of how Unix/Linux works.  Some Experiments...  (0)  The Setup  [root@...3:/] ls -l /usr/share/applications/minimal.desktop -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 28 /usr/share/applications/minimal.desktop  [root@...3:/] cat /usr/share/applications/minimal.desktop [Desktop Entry] Exec=cat $0  (1)  Is .desktop file executed when all is normal?  [root@...3:/] /usr/share/applications/minimal.desktop bash: /usr/share/applications/minimal.desktop: Permission denied  [root@...3:/] bash -c /usr/share/applications/minimal.desktop bash: /usr/share/applications/minimal.desktop: Permission denied  (2)  Is .desktop file executable when made executable?  [root@...3:/] chmod /usr/share/applications/minimal.desktop  [root@...3:/] ls -l /usr/share/applications/minimal.desktop -rwxr--r-- 1 root root 28 /usr/share/applications/minimal.desktop  [root@...3:/] /usr/share/applications/minimal.desktop /usr/share/applications/minimal.desktop: line 1: [Desktop: command not found /usr/share/applications/minimal.desktop: line 1: [Desktop: command not found     (endless loop.

[root@...3:/] grep 'chromium' /etc/passwd - chromium:/home/Chromium27:/bin/bash  [root@...3:/] su chromium -c '/usr/share/applications/minimal.desktop' bash: /usr/share/applications/minimal.desktop: Permission denied  [root@...3:/] su - chromium -c '/usr/share/applications/minimal.desktop' -bash: /usr/share/applications/minimal.desktop: Permission denied  CONCLUSIONS  (1)  File (and directory) ownership and permissions control what can be executed. Not whether the command appears in a file or script somewhere.  (2)  Appropriate settings of the standard ownership and permissions in /etc/passwd and on the .desktop file seem to be working to prevent unauthorized execution.  (3)  If an unexpected user IS able to execute the command, then the system is misconfigured (a VERY common situation).  (4)  If misconfigured (incorrect ownership/permissions somewhere), thinking a user shouldn't be able to do something because there is no explicit path to doing it is a misunderstanding of how Unix/Linux works.  (5)  The text following "Exec=" in a .desktop file is "exec'd". That is, it replaces whatever program is processing the .desktop file. Then the OUTPUT of the exec'd command is executed. That's not what I expected. I expected the 'cat' command to display the contents of the desktop file... not try to execute it recursively. Is that a bug or just my misunderstanding of something?
