The argument is knee-capped by CVE being slowly and incrementally assigned.  The cost of incremental change is nowhere near as visible to vendors.  They just patch issues one by one equally as slowly then blame the end  users for not upgrading/patching firmware. When the firmware upgrade  process itself is shrouded by lots of scary warnings and technical  actions that prevent home users doing it.   The stick doesn't work too well with vendors and distributors. Too much  greed these days. And that means the carrot works better - we just have  to figure out what the best carrot looks like.
