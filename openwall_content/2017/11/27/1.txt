We also provide minimal patches for the and releases:  - - - - -  We urge all users of these versions to migrate to the 4.X release trains.  Please feel free to contact me directly if you have any question.  Best regards,  PowerDNS Security Advisory Insufficient validation of DNSSEC ===================================================================== signatures ==========  -  CVE: -  Date: November 27th -  Credit: Kees Monshouwer -  Affects: PowerDNS Recursor from and up to and including -  Not affected: PowerDNS Recursor < -  Severity: Medium -  Impact: Records manipulation -  Exploit: This problem can be triggered by an attacker in position of    man-in-the-middle -  Risk of system compromise: No -  Solution: Upgrade to a non-affected version  An issue has been found in the DNSSEC validation component of PowerDNS Recursor, where the signatures might have been accepted as valid even if the signed data was not in bailiwick of the DNSKEY used to sign it. This allows an attacker in position of man-in-the-middle to alter the content of records by issuing a valid signature for the crafted records. This issue has been assigned  PowerDNS Recursor from up to and including are affected.  For those unable to upgrade to a new version, a minimal patch is available:  We would like to thank Kees Monshouwer for finding and subsequently reporting this issue.  PowerDNS Security Advisory Missing check on API operations ===================================================================  -  CVE: -  Date: November 27th -  Credit: everyman -  Affects: PowerDNS Authoritative up to and including -  Not affected: PowerDNS Authoritative -  Severity: Low -  Impact:  Denial of service -  Exploit: This problem can be triggered by an attacker with valid    API credentials -  Risk of system compromise: No -  Solution: Upgrade to a non-affected version  An issue has been found in the API component of PowerDNS Authoritative, where some operations that have an impact on the state of the server are still allowed even though the API has been configured as read-only via the `api-readonly` keyword. This missing check allows an attacker with valid API credentials could flush the cache, trigger a zone transfer or send a NOTIFY. This issue has been assigned  PowerDNS Authoritative up to and including and are affected.  For those unable to upgrade to a new version, a minimal patch is available:  We would like to thank everyman for finding and subsequently reporting this issue.  PowerDNS Security Advisory Cross-Site Scripting in the web =================================================================== interface =========  -  CVE: -  Date: November 27th -  Credit: Nixu, Chris Navarrete of Fortinet's Fortiguard Labs -  Affects: PowerDNS Recursor from up to and including -  Not affected: PowerDNS Recursor 3.7.x -  Severity: Medium -  Impact: Alteration and denial of service of the web interface -  Exploit: This problem can be triggered by an attacker sending DNS queries    to the server -  Risk of system compromise: No -  Solution: Upgrade to a non-affected version  An issue has been found in the web interface of PowerDNS Recursor, where the qname of DNS queries was displayed without any escaping, allowing a remote attacker to inject HTML and Javascript code into the web interface, altering the content. This issue has been assigned  PowerDNS Recursor from up to and including are affected.  For those unable to upgrade to a new version, a minimal patch is available:  We would like to thank Nixu and Chris Navarrete of Fortinet's Fortiguard Labs for independently finding and reporting this issue.  PowerDNS Security Advisory Configuration file injection in the ======================================================================= API ===  -  CVE: -  Date: November 27th -  Credit: Nixu -  Affects: PowerDNS Recursor up to and including -  Not affected: PowerDNS Recursor -  Severity: Medium -  Impact: Alteration of configuration by an API user -  Exploit: This problem can be triggered by an attacker with valid API    credentials -  Risk of system compromise: No -  Solution: Upgrade to a non-affected version -  Workaround: Disable the ability to alter the configuration via the API by setting `api-config-dir` to an empty value (default), or set the API read-only via the `api-readonly` setting.  An issue has been found in the API of PowerDNS Recursor during a source code audit by Nixu. When `api-config-dir` is set to a non-empty value, which is not the case by default, the API allows an authorized user to update the Recursor's ACL by adding and removing netmasks, and to configure forward zones. It was discovered that the new netmask and IP addresses of forwarded zones were not sufficiently validated, allowing an authenticated user to inject new configuration directives into the Recursor's configuration. This issue has been assigned  PowerDNS Recursor up to and including and are affected.  For those unable to upgrade to a new version, a minimal patch is available:  We would like to thank Nixu for finding and subsequently reporting this issue.  PowerDNS Security Advisory Memory leak in DNSSEC parsing =================================================================  -  CVE: -  Date: November 27th -  Credit: Nixu -  Affects: PowerDNS Recursor from up to and including -  Not affected: PowerDNS Recursor -  Severity: Medium -  Impact:  Denial of service -  Exploit: This problem can be triggered by an authoritative server    sending crafted ECDSA DNSSEC keys to the Recursor. -  Risk of system compromise: No -  Solution: Upgrade to a non-affected version -  Workaround: Disable DNSSEC validation by setting the `dnssec` parameter to `off` or `process-no-validate` (default).  An issue has been found in the DNSSEC parsing code of PowerDNS Recursor during a code audit by Nixu, leading to a memory leak when parsing specially crafted DNSSEC ECDSA keys. These keys are only parsed when validation is enabled by setting `dnssec` to a value other than `off` or `process-no-validate` (default). This issue has been assigned  PowerDNS Recursor from up to and including are affected.  For those unable to upgrade to a new version, a minimal patch is available:  We would like to thank Nixu for finding and subsequently reporting this issue.  --  Remi and the PowerDNS team    Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
