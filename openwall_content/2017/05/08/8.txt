E.g. If you find a specific XSS in a product for example, or a globbing problem in an FTP server that allows someone to crash it by ls */*/*....*/*/*. Alternatively there can be CVE's for protocol level flaws (e.g. where the specification itself was flawed), or for security technologies that aren't secure anymore (e.g. DES, 56bit keyspace just isn't big enough anymore with a modern laptop, let alone access to cloud GPU systems) to name a few more general cases.  Also for DoS type attacks it can be a gray area, e.g. "send a ping of death, system crashes" is clearly a problem, but "open X Million connections and system gets slow" is... well... normal behavior for most things. In the case of globbing where do we go from "it simply takes a long time for a complicated request" to "this is pathological behavior and needs to be fixed" (it takes 1 second? seconds? minutes?).  In any event if there are specific instances of a given FTP server (or whatever) that can be crashed/made really non responsive by this class of attack then that is appropriate to ask for a CVE and would be given one.
