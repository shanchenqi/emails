I'd like to see the same  exploit, without assuming the developer on the software had no idea what  they're doing (passing non-sanitized variables to functions). As well,  you noted in your own article that this 'discovery' was first published  in by someone else.  > > I reveal some exim code-execution vectors in there that should change > the whole game slightly :)  Not really, because it still relies on unfiltered input.
