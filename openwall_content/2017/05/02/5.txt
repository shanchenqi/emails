A specifically crafted request can overflow the request/response page array. A few distinct attack vectors exist which all lead to system hang/crash and have possibly other unspecified impact.  The attack vectors require at least read access to a NFS mount on the target host.  The issue has been verified to be reproducible on multiple baselines. At least 3.2, 4.4, 4.8 and baselines (and distributions derived from those) have been confirmed to be vulnerable. Fixed in release.  CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H (7.7 / High)  Upstream patch:  This issue was found by Tuomas HaanpĂ¤Ă¤ and Matti Kamunen from Synopsys Ltd with Synopsys Defensics fuzzer.
