A specifically crafted request can extract chunks of arbitrary memory from both kernel-space and user-space.  The attack vector requires write access to a NFS mount on the target host.  The issue has been verified to be reproducible on multiple baselines. At least 3.2, 4.4, 4.8 and baselines (and distributions derived from those) have been confirmed to be vulnerable. Fixed in release. Most probably this has been introduced about 10 years ago due to fs/nfsd changes for  CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N (7.7 / High)  Upstream patch:  This issue was found by Ari Kauppi from Synopsys Ltd with Synopsys Defensics fuzzer combined with KASAN.
