Added email header syntax to patches, for e.g. git-am.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  64-bit PV guests typically use separate (root) page tables for their kernel and user modes.  Hypercalls are accessible to guest kernel context only, which certain hypercall handlers make assumptions on. The IRET hypercall (replacing the identically name CPU instruction) is used by guest kernels to transfer control from kernel mode to user mode.  If such an IRET hypercall is placed in the middle of a multicall batch, subsequent operations invoked by the same multicall batch may wrongly assume the guest to still be in kernel mode.  If one or more of these subsequent operations involve operations on page tables, they may be using the wrong root page table, confusing internal accounting.  As a result the guest may gain writable access to some of its page tables.  IMPACT ======  A malicious or buggy 64-bit PV guest may be able to access all of system memory, allowing for all of privilege escalation, host crashes, and information leaks.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All 64-bit Xen versions are vulnerable.  Only x86 systems are affected.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.  The vulnerability is only exposed to 64-bit PV guests.  HVM guests and 32-bit PV guests can't exploit the vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only HVM or 32-bit PV guests will avoid the vulnerability.  The vulnerability can be avoided if the guest kernel is controlled by the host rather than guest administrator, provided that further steps are taken to prevent the guest administrator from loading code into the kernel (e.g. by disabling loadable modules etc) or from using other mechanisms which allow them to run code at kernel privilege.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Jann Horn of Google Project Zero.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            xen-unstable       Xen 4.8.x       Xen 4.7.x       Xen 4.6.x       Xen 4.5.x  $      $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
