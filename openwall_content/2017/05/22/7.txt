For e.g. the Linux Kernel I just used "Linux" as vendor, for Xen "Xen" and similar.  (and in general:) Please everyone do the distributors a favour and link to GIT commits with fixes for the requested CVE or at least explicit single reproducers, as we have increasing trouble of associating CVEs with the correct place in code.
