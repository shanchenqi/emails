Linux isn't impacted in a security-relevant way by these bugs. You're claiming that some downstream code is implemented in a way that impacts security, but you can't explain how it compromises a meaningful security boundary.  > > Anyway, good luck with meaningless Red Hat security theatre.

You've only brought up an incomplete implementation of verified boot based on a fork of the Linux kernel. It should be filed against that fork, but it really doesn't make any sense to have a CVE for a non-security feature being broken.  > > Sorry for thinking that this should be about something more than > > padding CVs and marketing materials. > >  >  > I suggest then you take this up with the original researcher if you're > worried about people padding their CVs. This discussion isn't > productive/helpful and I suggest you take it off list.  I'm not just concerned about people padding their CVs, I'm concerned about vendors marketing incomplete snake oil as an implementation of security features that actually have a meaning and then turning it into nonsense like this.  I suggest taking discussions about non-security bugs off list. It's not on topic here.
