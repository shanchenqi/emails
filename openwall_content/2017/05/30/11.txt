Secure boot means verifying boot chain from a root of trust in hardware.  It's you who doesn't seem to understand how it works, and yet you're telling that to me...  The late stage bootloader needs to verify the kernel / initrd and then the kernel verifies the userspace OS if it's a full implementation. It doesn't make sense for the kernel line to be left unverified as part of that, and it isn't how ChromeOS / Android implement it. They verify the kernel line as part of the initrd and don't allow setting a custom one unless the bootloader is unlocked, which disables verified boot anyway.  > They restrict some > features so that they cannot be selected from the kernel command line > (or later from userland), and they do not rely on a bootloader which > does not provide any means for editing the kernel command line.

A user on Android / ChromeOS doesn't have root access so while Android uses SELinux heavily (far more than RHEL / Fedora) it isn't really related to this at all.
