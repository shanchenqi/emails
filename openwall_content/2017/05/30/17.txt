To everyone else, it's not an arbitrary bureaucratic/marketing feature. It's verification of the whole base OS... i.e. Android, Android Things (Brillo), ChromeOS, iOS and sane embedded Linux systems. Likely Windows on mobile devices too, and I really doubt that Microsoft doesn't plan on verifying the userspace OS if they don't already.  Anyway, good luck with meaningless Red Hat security theatre. These "vulnerabilities" are just reinforcing the view that security people are foolish. There isn't disagreement that it's a meaningless feature with this level of incompleteness and yet a CVE is assigned for it? Okay then...  Sorry for thinking that this should be about something more than padding CVs and marketing materials.
