It's a vulnerability in the verified boot implementation if there's attacker control over the kernel line to this extent.  Even if we're going to treat memory corruption specially, you can corrupt memory simply via crazy configuration on the kernel command line... that is parsed properly, but then breaks at runtime. You can also happily disable features like rodata to make your life easier, since... you control the kernel line. I can't understand what kind of threat model considers these valid CVEs.
