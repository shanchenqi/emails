The details are below.  The bugs were found with syzkaller.  *  The inet_csk_clone_lock function in net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c in the Linux kernel through allows attackers to cause a denial of service (double free) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging use of the accept system call.  CVE: Fix:  *  The sctp_v6_create_accept_sk function in net/sctp/ipv6.c in the Linux kernel through mishandles inheritance, which allows local users to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted system calls, a related issue to  CVE: Fix:  *  The dccp_v6_request_recv_sock function in net/dccp/ipv6.c in the Linux kernel through mishandles inheritance, which allows local users to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted system calls, a related issue to  CVE: Fix:  *  The tcp_v6_syn_recv_sock function in net/ipv6/tcp_ipv6.c in the Linux kernel through mishandles inheritance, which allows local users to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted system calls, a related issue to  CVE: Fix:  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
