Is there a realistic way in which an attacker can provide Linux kernel command-line arguments, without being able to achieve arbitrary code execution via those command-line arguments?  In other words, is this a security vulnerability, or just a bug?  (If the attacker can already achieve arbitrary code execution then this bug does not give them any capability they do not already have.)
