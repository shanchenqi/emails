So I will.  I think Daniel is mostly right about the technical aspects of the issue. For most setups, it's non-security.  Roee Hay brought the below related issue to the distros list on May 16:   I didn't participate in the discussion about it on distros as others appeared to be handling it OK'ish (within list policy).  In that discussion, Jason A. Donenfeld asked about init=/bin/sh, to which Roee Hay replied:  | Great question! I think your point is perfectly valid, however please note that at least for the late AOSP boot/recovery images, the rootfs has contains a very limited set of binaries (see next). Moreover, a bootloader vuln could theoretically give you partial control only over the kernel cmdline (e.g. 'init=' and such are filtered, but 'lp=' is not). |  | Nexus 6: | shamu:/ # ls -la /sbin | adbd  healthd  slideshow ueventd  watchdogd |  | Nexus 6P: | angler:/ # ls /sbin | adbd  healthd  ueventd  watchdogd  This might or might not be a valid point, but I think handling the issue via the distros list (and thus with an embargo) was wrong.  It would have been better to have this discussion (if we must) on oss-security right away, rather than only now when a second related issue is brought in here later same month.  Going forward, I think I should insist that such mostly non-security and minor issues be made public right away.  Unfortunately, this will be spammy to oss-security, like this thread maybe was, but we do have a policy to bring everything from distros to oss-security eventually anyway, and I do not want to introduce my own judgement on what's a security issue vs. not, especially in cases where opinions vary as we've seen in this thread.  Luckily, the latest issue that started this thread wasn't ever on the distros list.  That's an improvement.

I guess Daniel might be associating the other side's arguments with Red Hat's because Florian was posting from a redhat.com address.  I have no idea whether Florian actually spoke on behalf of Red Hat or not, but either way I think the focus on Red Hat is excessive - e.g., in the distros list thread on the previous issue, another distro vendor inquired about the proposed public disclosure date, implying they also might care.  A better summary would be: understanding & opinions vary.  > > Sorry for thinking that this should be about something more than > > padding CVs and marketing materials. >  > I suggest then you take this up with the original researcher if you're > worried about people padding their CVs.  I am not happy about judging other people (especially as I could be wrong) nor moderating the list based on such criteria.  It's irrelevant what someone's motivation is.(*)  It's relevant whether the messages are valuable, which I admit is questionable here.  Sometimes things get way too spammy such as in message wording or count.  In this thread, we're probably above the message count that this topic is worth.  (*) While motivation is irrelevant to list moderation, it is nevertheless relevant to processes in this and related communities, which might affect software security.  It may also be relevant to risks from individual security issues, such as when some issues are first sold to a bug bounty program and are only made public when there's upstream fix.  But I digress.  > This discussion isn't > productive/helpful and I suggest you take it off list.  To me, it looks like the discussion had already ended, even if without people getting on the same page, by the time Kurt posted.  I can only confirm that, yes, we should probably end this thread here unless someone has something entirely new to add.  Alexander  P.S. What a waste of time.
