A CVE being issued for one of these issues didn't make sense.  If there's verified boot, it needs to cover the kernel command-line. If it doesn't, that's a vulnerability. Memory corruption bugs aren't needed for an attacker to make use of the kernel line.  Fixing these bugs makes sense, but treating them as vulnerabilities is just going to turn off the Linux kernel developers to security people even more since it's pretty much nonsense.
