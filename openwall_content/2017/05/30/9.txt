Also not sure what you mean by patches. Secure boot doesn't require applying patches. The kernel has to be verified by an early boot chain and dm-verity is in mainline for verifying the rest of the OS as Android and ChromeOS do. Android does have some tweaks for dm-verity but they're workarounds for bureaucracy rather than true technical requirements.
