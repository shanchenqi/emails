We did this 3 years ago:  https://cve.mitre.org/cve/identifiers/syntaxchange.html  Examples  Examples of identifiers in the new CVE ID syntax are included below. There is no limit on the number of arbitrary digits. Leading 0’s will only be used in IDs 1 to as shown in column one below.  IDs with 4 digits	IDs with 5 digits	IDs with 6 digits	IDs with 7 digits NOTE: Some of the CVE ID examples above have not yet been assigned.  The DWF CNA has the block through so yes, these are legitimate. E.g.:      --   Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
