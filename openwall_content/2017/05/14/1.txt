This is a reference to the Vanilla Linux sources without any distribution specific patching. Typically a number of distributions apply their own patches to the standard vanilla Kernel.   The patches might also not be needed for 4.1.y sources as were discussed on the mailing list [see [2]].   Please check with the distribution you are using to see if the patches for have been applied to the kernel 4.1.y tree for the distribution that you are using.
