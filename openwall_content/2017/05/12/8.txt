A resource such as a malicious third-party aircraft could exploit this to damage files belonging to the user. Both this issue and are directory traversal vulnerabilities in Autopilot/route_mgr.cxx - this one exists because of an incomplete fix for  ------------------------------------------  [Additional Information] We are not aware of any such malicious resource. The fix will be in FlightGear (expected in 1 or 2 weeks before the vulnerability was found). There may be a stable update too meanwhile with the fix, but I can't guarantee if so, and when.
