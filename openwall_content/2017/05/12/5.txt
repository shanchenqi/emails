I have attempted to see what the status is, but no responses from ILM. Since this has surpassed the general 90-day mark as is standard for many disclosures, these are being disclosed. Itâs actually been days exactly.  You can see the last update to the OpenEXR codebase was on January 9. https://github.com/openexr/openexr <https://github.com/openexr/openexr>  Of note is that Adobe Photoshop actually ships with a version of OpenEXR for reading EXR images, so some of these images also crash Photoshop. ImageMagick also can support EXR image by using the OpenEXR library. https://github.com/ImageMagick/exr/tree/master/openexr <https://github.com/ImageMagick/exr/tree/master/openexr>  As of this writing, these issues are unfixed.
