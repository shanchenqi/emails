When a power failure (or hardware reset) occurs, applications writing to an ext4 filesystem system may create a situation in which writes to one file may appear in another file (ergo information leak).  This may be at least data corruption, a controlled attacker may be able to leverage this to steal data from writes to the same ext4 subsystem.
