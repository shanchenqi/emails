Therefore if one user placed a symlink to another socket instead of socket for another use then said another user will either be unable to get menu, or will receive menu of some other user.  This bug has been assigned to [1].  A fix has been committed to menu-cache's git repository [2].  LXDE developers are working on a release which fixes the problem.
