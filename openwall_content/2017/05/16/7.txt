It hit my inbox when I'd just come back from 2 weeks vacation.  When it finally got my attention, the mail itself did little to make me think it was legit, since I saw an attachment and a subject line that was generic in the extreme. Mentally, I filed it as spam. Virtually, too.  I saw more traction on oss-security with the same subject, and realised (too late, I fear) that it wasn't yet another phishing attempt. I also heard from other channels that people were trying to contact me.  My fault. Sorry.  The security team at NetBSD have done an analysis, and have our own comments to make. I'll do that in due course.  > At least the distros' list messages were being accepted by the NetBSD > mail server.

I used to be on oss-security. Don't know what happened if I've been thrown off.  >> What are we doing these days?
