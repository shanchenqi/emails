Over the last few days, there have been repeated requests to get a response specifically from NetBSD in a thread on the distros list. There was no response.  Additionally, the reporter of a vulnerability mentioned getting no response to their direct e-mail to your security-officer address.  At least the distros' list messages were being accepted by the NetBSD mail server.  (I checked our logs.)  I think you're one of the people subscribed to distros for NetBSD (until I suspended the subscription for reasons mentioned above half an hour ago).  Right?  Did you receive those messages?  If not, let's troubleshoot that now.  If you did, then why the lack of response?  Are you also on oss-security?  I can't find you among the subscribers.  > What are we doing these days?

Sounds reasonable, but let's figure out what went wrong above first.  I'm sorry for maybe creating drama, but this was already first brought up on the distros list itself (and elicited no response from any NetBSD person), and besides stuff on the distros list isn't meant to stay private forever anyway (even though this normally applies to vulnerabilities rather than to administrivia).
