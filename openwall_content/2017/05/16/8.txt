I'll do that in due course.  OK.  For now, I'll resume NetBSD subscription with you as the only representative, since we still haven't heard from the other two persons who were subscribed for NetBSD (no need for them to post to oss-security now, but at least they can reply on the distros thread if they read it, or to me personally).  You were on vacation, but they could respond - in fact, that's an often cited reason to have multiple people subscribed.  > I used to be on oss-security. Don't know what happened if I've been thrown off.  I'll e-mail you off-list to figure this out.
