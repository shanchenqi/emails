Small binary attachments (total message size of up to KB including overhead) are accepted, but unfortunately image/tiff was on the mimeremove list, so your attachment didn't get through.  I've just removed image/tiff from mimeremove.  Please resend (if small enough).  As to why have mimeremove at all: many people use MUAs or/and have signatures that always attach needless files (e.g., a text/html portion linking to a company logo, which is also included).  But I guess use of image/tiff for those is very unusual, so there was no good reason to have this MIME type removed.  The current mimeremove is:  application/ms-tnef text/html text/x-vcard image/gif image/jpeg image/png  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
