It might be worth noting that in the README file on the documentation repo.  It wouldn't take long and may prevent confusion in the meantime.  > Good question. What exactly is it you want to input? CVE requests? CVE > assignments? Modify existing CVE entries?  Primarily, freeform discussion of the sort that occurred on this list as a natural outcropping of the CVE request process led to people linking to verification code, temporary mitigations, highlighting of incomplete fixes, and the sort of information that was requested earlier in this thread.  This ability to easily chip in to ongoing situations wasn't just useful for mitre staff doing CVE work, it was also useful for the "community of practice" looking for the latest information regarding self-defense.  I've prevented more than one attack thanks to a one-off reply from someone in response to a CVE request.    The CVE assignment process was more than just a collaborative database-population effort.  With the shift to webforms and javascript the natural environment which promoted that discourse is being removed.  > Not really. the docs are out of date and I'm more concerned about > evolving this right now then updating documentation.  Again, I strongly suggest you note on the README that this is the case. As matters stand the documentation represents itself as accurate.  khm  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
