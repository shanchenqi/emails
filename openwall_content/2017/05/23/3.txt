Neither, that's part of what I'm figuring out. Most likely it'll look like a trusted pool of people (aka CVE Mentors) that can either contribute or more easily gatekeep). Also the doc are out of date and the process is evolving rapidly so I haven't really bothered updating them since things keep changing.  > At what point in the DWF process is third-party input expected to occur?  Good question. What exactly is it you want to input? CVE requests? CVE assignments? Modify existing CVE entries? > The matter is not addressed in the documentation repository.

Not really. the docs are out of date and I'm more concerned about evolving this right now then updating documentation.  > > khm  --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
