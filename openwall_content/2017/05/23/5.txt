I happen to be a long time poster/moderator, but I have no official control/etc (I don't even block posts, that's up to solar, I just allow stuff or ignore it when it's up for moderation).  The DWF will not be taking CVE requests on oss-security (ditto for MITRE/etc.), why? They're way to messy. We need well structured requests i we want this to scale (I should know, I've done over CVE assignments). One goal is to get CVE assignments down to minutes with minimal latency (e.g. a large pool of assigners so timezones aren't a problem). This stuff can then be posted to oss-security WITH a CVE.  Or you can post it to oss-security WITHOUT a CVE (like you did in past) and still have all the discussion. The only change is if you want a CVE you hav to fill out a simple form and wait a bit. You had to wait when you posted here so the waiting part hasn't changed much. (well ok, right now the DWF is slow, but again I'm working on that).  > > The CVE assignment process was more than just a collaborative > database-population effort.
