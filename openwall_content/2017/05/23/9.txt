After have fuzzed the release and have found something already documented in the previous posts, I re-tested the new release and the fuzzer turned up some issues. I donât know if those issues were present also in the old releases or the recent commits introduced them.  # imagew $FILE /tmp/out -outfmt bmp runtime error: division by zero runtime error: value inf is outside the range of representable values of type 'int' Commit fix: Reproducer: CVE:  ############################  # imagew $FILE /tmp/out -outfmt bmp runtime error: division by zero runtime error: value inf is outside the range of representable values of type 'int' Commit fix: Reproducer: CVE:  ############################  # imagew $FILE /tmp/out -outfmt bmp runtime error: index -1 out of bounds for type 'struct iw_channelinfo_out [4]' Commit fix: Reproducer: CVE:  ############################  # imagew $FILE /tmp/out -outfmt bmp AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address (pc bp sp T0)                   signal is caused by a READ memory access.                                                                                                    #0 in iw_get_ui16le                   #1 in iw_get_ui16_e                      #2 in iwjpeg_scan_exif_ifd            #3 in iwjpeg_scan_exif                   #4 in iwjpeg_read_saved_markers          #5 in iw_read_jpeg_file                  #6 in iw_read_file_by_fmt           #7 in iwcmd_run                              #8 in iwcmd_main                             #9 in main                                     #10 in __libc_start_main                               #11 in _init  AddressSanitizer can not provide additional info.
