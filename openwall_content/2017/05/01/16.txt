Indeed, original tests by Solar Designer and Jason A. Donenfeld might have targeted xfce4-terminal 0.6 which is written in GTK2 and use vte2 while more recent versions (starting 0.8) use GTK3 and vte3.  I tried running the perl script with current Debian sid and:  xfce4-terminal  I wasn't able to make the process crash (it seems stuck at some point but the window is somehow resized and I don't have access to the content so it' not clear why).  Out of curiosity I also tried lxterminal which is vte2 based, along with:  libvte9  and I wasn't able to crash the process either. This time the perl process terminates successfully.
