It is perhaps worth noting that guided fuzzing has been used in this space with good results, too. For example, AFL was credited on at least the following in rxvt, tmux, screen, and mosh:   Especially if what's highlighted in this thread can be found with a simple script, I'm betting there's far more beneath the surface. Guided fuzzers have the advantage of being able to discover features that may be undocumented or hard to spot, so a more comprehensive dive into all the terminal emulators in use today would probably be quite fruitful.  /mz  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
