I agree - rxvt-unicode shouldn't reply with a LF when in secure mode (this is a policy). The sequence in question is also not used (or even usable, as it queries the original rxvt graphics mode which is not implemented in urxvt), so the next version will have it disabled, at least in secure mode (the default).  > The risk probability is low, but this is nevertheless a valid security > issue to patch.  I agree, it is a reasonable defense in depth mechanism where the benefit clearly outweighs the disadvantages.  > (The pasted text appears to vary between "0" and "1".)  urxvt always replies with to indicate "graphics mode not supported".

It is fully expected that malicious escape sequences can make  Again, I fully agree - I just couldn't make the connection between the patch sent and these "riskiest escape sequences".  --                  The choice of a       Deliantra, the free code+content MORPG       -----==-     _GNU_              http://www.deliantra.net       ----==-- _       generation       ---==---(_)__  __ ____  __      Marc Lehmann       --==---/ / _ \/ // /\ \/ /      schmorp@...morp.de       -=====/_/_//_/\_,_/ /_/\_\  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
