Quoting "man urxvt", section "RESOURCES":   insecure: boolean    Enables "insecure" mode. Rxvt-unicode offers some escape sequences   that echo arbitrary strings like the icon name or the locale. This   could be abused if somebody gets 8-bit-clean access to your display,   whether through a mail client displaying mail bodies unfiltered or   through write(1) or any other means. Therefore, these sequences are   disabled by default. (Note that many other terminals, including xterm,   have these sequences enabled by default, which doesn't make it safer,   though).    You can enable them by setting this boolean resource or specifying   -insecure as an option. At the moment, this enables display-answer,   locale, findfont, icon label and window title requests.  My ~/.Xresources file, trimmed.  I am sure it is getting read, because of the cutchars, colors and geometry settings:   Rxvt.background: seashell  Rxvt.color10: green4  Rxvt.color11: orange2  Rxvt.color14: cyan4  Rxvt.color2: green3  Rxvt.color3: orange  Rxvt.color6: cyan3  Rxvt.cutchars: '"!' &()*,;<=>?@[]^{|} #$%+-./:  Rxvt.foreground: Gray40  Rxvt.geometry:  Rxvt.saveLines:  Rxvt.visualBell: on  URxvt.font:  URxvt.perl-ext-common:  URxvt.insecure: false  Finally, a chunk of my ~/.bashrc:   # If this is an xterm set the title to something informative  case "$TERM" in          xterm*|rxvt*)              PROMPT_COMMAND="echo -ne \"\E]0; $$ ${LOGNAME}@...OSTNAME}:\${PWD} \a\""              ;;          *)              ;;  esac  And ... it works!
