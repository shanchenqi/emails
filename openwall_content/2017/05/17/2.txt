I can only guess that somebody for the hundredth time found out that terminals are more than dumb display devices and got excited that, somehow, this might be a security issue. Without knowing details, I can't say for sure, but most likely, this is a security issue the same way blindly feeding unknown commands to your shell is, i.e., it's a problem somewhere else - the protocol between terminals and programs is not a (strong) security barrier.  (your echo command is bash-specific, btw.)  --                  The choice of a       Deliantra, the free code+content MORPG       -----==-     _GNU_              http://www.deliantra.net       ----==-- _       generation       ---==---(_)__  __ ____  __      Marc Lehmann       --==---/ / _ \/ // /\ \/ /      schmorp@...morp.de       -=====/_/_//_/\_,_/ /_/\_\  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
