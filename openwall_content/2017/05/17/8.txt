My own downstream -- Gentoo's jer@, also CCd -- won't include the patch until the agreement of upstream. Thus, it's important we come to a good conclusion.

Hi Marc,  This patch was part of a larger discussion on which you were CCd from distros. It seems possible that either those messages didn't make it to you, or you didn't have time to read them.  In any case, the attached patch would be a useful defense in depth measure to prevent future integer overflow bugs, such as the one that was recently found in rxvt. Briefly looking though the code, it seems like there is a considerable amount of unchecked integer arithmetic, often passing between several functions in several files. Short of somehow auditing every arithmetic call path, a considerable undertaking, Alexander and I would recommend simply limiting the range of input from users.  As Alexander wrote in a recent email to you, the general opinion of this list is that terminal emulators should not support the most dangerous uses of escape sequences, even if they're technically valid. The attached patch falls into that category. You seem to have made the argument that the patch "might break valid uses". I've now provided to you a bit of the backstory and recent basis which motivates this patch. If this is compelling, I'd rest well knowing it's accepted upstream. If this is not compelling, could you indicate to the list why "might break valid uses" outweighs the potential security mitigations?
