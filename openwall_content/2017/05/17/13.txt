An additional CVE ID got assigned for the password change finding:   Meanwhile the Dolibarr developers fixed more possible SQL injection bugs in this git commit:  They still didn't release a fixed version of the Dolibarr software.    For I don't agree with the CVSS v2 scoring from the NIST. They rated "Confidentiality Impact" as partial while I think it is complete as we have full access to all tables.
