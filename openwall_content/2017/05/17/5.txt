Please consider the following example:  $ tail -n1 /etc/hosts | xxd  Z 5a5a 0a                                  ZZ. $ ping ZZZ PING ; bytes of data. ^[G0 64 bytes from ; icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 ms ^[G0 64 bytes from ; icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 ms ^[G0 ^C --- ; ping statistics --- 2 packets transmitted, 2 received, 0% packet loss, time rtt min/avg/max/mdev = ms ^[G0 $ 0 bash: 0: command not found  I'm not sure if this works with real reverse DNS look-ups, but with /etc/hosts it seems so.  > i.e., it's a problem somewhere else - the protocol between > terminals and programs is not a (strong) security barrier. > > (your echo command is bash-specific, btw.)  --  Robert Święcki  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
