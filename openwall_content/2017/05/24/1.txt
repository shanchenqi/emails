While validating the server's certificate during the connection setup, the client doesn't seem to be verifying the common name attribute of the certificate. In this way, if a JDBC client sends an SSL request to server abc.com, and the server responds with a valid certificate (certified by CA) but issued to xyz.com, the client will accept that as a valid certificate and the SSL handshake will go through.  Mitigation:  Upgrade to Apache Hive for 1.x release line, or to Apache Hive or later for 2.0.x release line, or to Apache Hive and later for 2.1.x release line.
