Several REST service endpoints of Apache Archiva are not protected against  Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. A malicious site opened in the same  browser as the archiva site, may send HTML response that performs arbitrary  actions on archiva services, with the same rights as the active archiva  session (e.g. adminstrator rights).  Mitigation:   All users are recommended to upgrade to Archiva or higher,    where additional measures are taken to verify the origin of REST requests.  References:  The newest Archiva version can be downloaded from: http://archiva.apache.org/download.cgi     Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
