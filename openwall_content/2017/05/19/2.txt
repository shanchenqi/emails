That seems like the kind of thing some wm or de might trust for soemthing important (like gtk modules, etc).  e.g.  $ printf "\e]3;%s=TEST\a" TEST_PROPERTY $ xprop -id $WINDOWID TEST_PROPERTY TEST_PROPERTY(UTF8_STRING) = "TEST"  The properties Gnome looks at are listed here, maybe you could cause some confusion this way. Do other environments (Xfce, KDE, etc) support more interesting properties?  https://wiki.gnome.org/Attic/ApplicationSpecification  Tavis.
