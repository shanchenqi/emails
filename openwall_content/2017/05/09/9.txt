Messages passed to these methods (Log.v(), Log.d(), Log.i(), Log.w(), and Log.e()) are stored in a series of circular buffers on the device. By default, a maximum of four 16 KB rotated logs are kept in addition to the current log. The logged data can be read using Logcat on the device. When using platforms prior to Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean), the log data is not sandboxed per applicationÍž any application installed on the device has the capability to read data logged by other applications.  Upgrade path: Developers who are concerned about this issue should upgrade to or later and install cordova plugins whose versions are equal to or greater than:  cordova-plugin-battery-status: cordova-plugin-camera: cordova-plugin-console: cordova-plugin-contacts: cordova-plugin-device: cordova-plugin-device-motion: cordova-plugin-device-orientation: cordova-plugin-dialogs: cordova-plugin-file: cordova-plugin-file-transfer: cordova-plugin-geolocation: cordova-plugin-globalization: cordova-plugin-inappbrowser: cordova-plugin-media: cordova-plugin-media-capture: cordova-plugin-network-information: cordova-plugin-splashscreen: cordova-plugin-statusbar: cordova-plugin-test-framework: cordova-plugin-vibration: cordova-plugin-whitelist: cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine:  Mitigation Steps: If developers are unable to install the latest versions, this vulnerability can easily be mitigated by not putting sensitive information in the log statements.
