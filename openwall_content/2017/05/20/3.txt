I would love to see that in all *Magick weakness reports.  Chris Evans' report (copied in the email you replied to) says this:  GraphicsMagick vs. ImageMagick, again. Well, well, look at this :) GraphicsMagick fixed this issue in March for the release, tucked away in a changeset titled "Fix SourceForge bug "out-of-bounds read in (see the second memset()). This is another case where tons of vulnerabilities are being found and fixed in both GraphicsMagick and ImageMagick with little co-ordination. This seems like a waste of effort and a risk of 0-day (or is it 1-day?) exposure. It goes both ways: the RLE memory corruption I referenced in my previous blog post was only fixed in GraphicsMagick in March having been previously fixed in ImageMagick in Dec  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
