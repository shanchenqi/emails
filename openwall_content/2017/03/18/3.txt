Yes, a reference to a commit is good to have, if you have time/resources for manual vulnerability analysis There is a trade-off, but I guess the point here is more on how to increase automation for mitigation/remediation of software vulnerabilities. Operation Rosehub is one example illustrating why it's important  On Sat, Mar 18, at AM, Brian May <brian@...uxpenguins.xyz> wrote:  > Ludovic Courtès <ludo@....org> writes: > > > Some CVE entries do not specify the version of the package(s) they apply > > to.
