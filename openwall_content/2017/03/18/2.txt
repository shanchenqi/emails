I am not sure the software version helps that much. It can lead to incorrect decision. For example, for security flaw B upstream might say versions before Y.Y.Y are not applicable - lets say version X.X.X < Y.Y.Y and as such as OK, because the do not contain the vulnerable code. In fact, somebody could check the code and mark this security flaw as not applicable.  Meanwhile, somebody else gets around to adding another (earlier) security patch for A to Y.Y.Y. This security adds the vulnerable code for B. Anybody making a quick inspection would not notice now that Y.Y.Y patched for A is now vulnerable to B. In fact B was already marked as not vulnerable, so there may not even be need to look at it again (not sure how to solve this problem).  While a "fixed in version" is useful, a pointer to a commit that fixed the problem would be even better - and means less speculation on which commit actually fixes the issue. In fact some upstreams won't even answer bug reports asking if security issues has been fixed or not. --  Brian May <brian@...uxpenguins.xyz> https://linuxpenguins.xyz/brian/  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
