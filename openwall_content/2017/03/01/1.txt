The first issue is mitigated with recent glibc's memcmp, particularly with -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2, and the other two by providing an implementation of arc4random at compile time, such as libbsd.  I expect these to be announced shortly at <https://www.x.org/wiki/Development/Security/>.    --  Doran Moppert Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
