Cashdollar" <larry0@...com> To: Open Source Security <oss-security@...ts.openwall.com> Subject: Remote file upload vulnerabilities in multiple wordpress plugins   Hello,  All of these plugins include unlicensed software developed by http://www.invedion.com/ that is vulnerable, I am unable to get  more details from the vendor as to what the software name and version are and therefor can't issue a CVE for just that software.  I've issued CVEs for the impacted plugins I know of:  Remote file upload vulnerability in Wordpress Plugin mobile-friendly-app-builder-by-easytouch v3.0 Example: http://example.com/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/mobile-friendly-app-builder-by-easytouch/server/images.php  Remote file upload vulnerability in Wordpress Plugin mobile-app-builder-by-appress Example: http://example.com/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/mobile-app-builder-by-wappress/server/images.php  Remote file upload vulnerability in Wordpress Plugin webapp-builder v2.0 Example: http://example.com/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/webapp-builder/server/images.php   Remote file upload vulnerability in Wordpress Plugin wp2android-turn-wp-site-into-android-app Example: http://example.com/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/wp2android-turn-wp-site-into-android-app/server/images.php  @muntopia provided an exploit for all of them here: https://github.com/alienwithin/Scripts-Sploits/blob/master/zen_app_mobile_wp_rfu.py Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
