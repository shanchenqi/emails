Exploiting the flaw in the vulnerable module n_hdlc does not require Microgate or SyncLink hardware. The module is automatically loaded if an unprivileged user opens a pseudoterminal and calls TIOCSETD ioctl for it setting N_HDLC line discipline.  The fix is currently on the way to the mainline kernel:  Some Linux distributions have already provided the security update.  However, you can mitigate the flaw manually by blocking n_hdlc autoloading by a system-wide modprobe rule in /etc/modprobe.d/ (refer to your Linux distribution documentation). In that case please check that n_hdlc is not already loaded.
