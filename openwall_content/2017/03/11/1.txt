I am only the Debian packager for wordpress so if the wordpress project itself wants to raise these CVEs then I'm all for handing it over to them.  Annoyingly, the mitre website breaks if you enter more than 2 requests in (or it doesn't like something I typed). Something deep in ScriptResource.axd gives a error, so it will take a while to key all 6 in. This also explains why all 6 were not entered in one go.   - Craig  > > -- Craig Small (@smallsees)   http://dropbear.xyz/     csmall at : enc.com.au Debian GNU/Linux           http://www.debian.org/   csmall at : debian.org GPG fingerprint:        5D2F  F96B DF50 FEA5   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
