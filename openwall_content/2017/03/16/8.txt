Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library is a GNU library to manipulate object files of many processor architecture (>=25) in a variety of formats (>=50). The library is used by several widely-used tools like GNU Assembler (GAS), GNU Linker (GLD), GNU Binary Utilities ("binutils") tools, and the GNU Debugger (GDB). Binutils' utilities like readelf, objdump and nm are common tools to analyze program objects..  Here is the list of bug reports & bug fixes. All of them have been confirmed and fixed by Binutils' maintainers.  1) Heap Buffer Overflow - Invalid Write in Readelf (bug still exists because of incomplete fix in PR  2) Heap Buffer Overflow - Invalid Read in BFD library's DWARF  3) Heap Buffer Overflow - Invalid Read in BFD library's handling of STABS debug information causing Objdump to crash  4) Global Buffer Overflow - Invalid Read in BFD library's handling of STABS debug information  5) Use after free in Readelf  6) Heap buffer overflow - invalid read of size 4 in Readelf  7) Heap buffer overflow in Readelf (Invalid Read of size 1) (bug still exists due to incomplete fix in PR  8) Heap buffer overflow in Readelf (Invalid Read of size 1)  9) Heap buffer overflow in Readelf (Multiple Invalid Read of size 1)  10) Heap buffer overflow in Readelf (Multiple Invalid Read of size 1)  11) Global buffer overflow in Nm (Invalid Read of size 1)  Could you please check whether these bugs are suitable for CVEs?
