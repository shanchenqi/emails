Thuan, thanks for sharing.  Since few time the cve requests happens on https://cveform.mitre.org instead  of here.  >From some time of fuzz experience, from multiple cve requests and multiple  feedback from mitre I'd say: - In any way you are able to crash a library, it needs a cve because it is  supposed to receive multiple inputs. - Undefined behavior in a library also needs a cve.  - while the bug is in a command line tool: 1) if it is a simple crash like fpe / segv, it is considered just an  inconvenience. 2) if it is an overflow with read of size 1 is also considered an inconveniece  unless you can demostrate any evidence of damage. The mentioned cases are not just an inconvenience unless there are common  cases where you know that for example a webapp relies on this command line  tool. 3) if it is an overflow with write access it should have a cve.   @everyone, if you think it is wrong or I missed something feel free to correct  me.    --  Agostino Sarubbo Gentoo Linux Developer  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
