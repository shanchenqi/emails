(from my experience, first versions of a CVE sometimes do not include the exact CPE versions, the CPE are (or should be used as) at that time a pattern (e.g. "starts with") (still helpful) and are then sometimes (and we should understand/recognize the time/effort needed) revised/detailed over time OVAL could help to circumvent that issue (e.g. patterns/regex, hashes, etc.)  imho, the root cause (or main issue) is: CVRF (or OASIS CSAF/CVRF) or CVE schema are lacking in their models/schemas/trees what is needed to automatically handle software components/dependencies e.g. of what would be needed:     On Wed, Mar 15, at PM, Kurt Seifried <kseifried@...hat.com> wrote:  > On Wed, Mar 15, at PM, Leo Famulari <leo@...ulari.name> wrote: > > > On Wed, Mar 15, at Seth Arnold wrote: > > > I suspect the solution is for people who rely upon these scanning tools > > to > > > do the leg work themselves on the packages they care about.
