A fuzz on it discovered a null pointer dereference. The upstream project denies me to open a new ticket. So, I just will forward this on the -users mailing list.  The complete ASan output:  # podofocolor dummy $FILE foo AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address (pc bp sp T0) signal is caused by a READ memory access. address points to the zero page.     #0 in PoDoFo::PdfColorGray::~PdfColorGray()     #1 in GraphicsStack::TGraphicsStackElement::~TGraphicsStackElement()     #2 in __gnu_cxx::new_allocator::destroy(GraphicsStack::TGraphicsStackElement*)     #3 in std::deque<GraphicsStack::TGraphicsStackElement, std::allocator >::_M_pop_back_aux()     #4 in std::deque<GraphicsStack::TGraphicsStackElement, std::allocator >::pop_back()     #5 in std::stack<GraphicsStack::TGraphicsStackElement, std::deque<GraphicsStack::TGraphicsStackElement, std::allocator > >::pop()     #6 in GraphicsStack::Pop()     #7 in ColorChanger::ReplaceColorsInPage(PoDoFo::PdfCanvas*)     #8 in ColorChanger::start()     #9 in main     #10 in __libc_start_main     #11 in _start  AddressSanitizer can not provide additional info.
