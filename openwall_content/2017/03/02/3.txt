A fuzz on it discovered a null pointer access. The upstream project denies me to open a new ticket. So, I just will forward this on the -users mailing list.  The complete ASan output:  # podofocolor dummy $FILE foo AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address (pc bp sp T0) signal is caused by a READ memory access. address points to the zero page.     #0 in getVtablePrefix     #1 in __ubsan::checkDynamicType(void*, void*, unsigned long)     #2 in HandleDynamicTypeCacheMiss     #3 in __ubsan_handle_dynamic_type_cache_miss     #4 in ColorChanger::GetColorFromStack(int, std::vector<PoDoFo::PdfVariant, std::allocator >&)     #5 in ColorChanger::ProcessColor(ColorChanger::EKeywordType, int, std::vector<PoDoFo::PdfVariant, std::allocator >&, GraphicsStack&)      #6 in ColorChanger::ReplaceColorsInPage(PoDoFo::PdfCanvas*)     #7 in ColorChanger::start()     #8 in main     #9 in __libc_start_main     #10 in _start  AddressSanitizer can not provide additional info.
