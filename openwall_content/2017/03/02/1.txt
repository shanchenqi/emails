A fuzz on it discovered an invalid memory read. The upstream project denies me to open a new ticket. So, I just will forward this on the -users mailing list.  The complete ASan output:  # podofocolor dummy $FILE foo AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address 0xffffffffffffffe0 (pc bp sp T0) signal is caused by a READ memory access.     #0 in ColorChanger::GetColorFromStack(int, std::vector<PoDoFo::PdfVariant, std::allocator >&)     #1 in ColorChanger::ProcessColor(ColorChanger::EKeywordType, int, std::vector<PoDoFo::PdfVariant, std::allocator >&, GraphicsStack&)      #2 in ColorChanger::ReplaceColorsInPage(PoDoFo::PdfCanvas*)     #3 in ColorChanger::start()     #4 in main     #5 in __libc_start_main     #6 in _start  AddressSanitizer can not provide additional info.
