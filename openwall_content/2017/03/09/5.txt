FLEXIcontent - Incorrect Authorization  (Authorization Bypass)  ----------- Vendor: ----------- FLEXIcontent (http://www.flexicontent.org) is an advanced content management system developed to greatly enhance the native content management of Joomla!  ----------------------------------------- Affected Products/Versions: ----------------------------------------- Note: Previous versions may be affected  ----------------- Description: ----------------- Title: Joomla! FLEXIcontent - Incorrect Authorization (Authorization Bypass) Incorrect Authorization Detailed write-up: http://www.openskycorp.com/resource-center/blog/joomla-flexicontent-incorrect-authorization/ Researcher: Seth Art  Description: "The software performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check. This allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions."  The FLEXIcontent plugin uses a query string parameter, task, which specifies the action to perform on a FLEXIcontent article.  If an unauthenticated actor provides any value other than edit or a blank value to the task parameter, the actor is able to view the restricted FLEXIcontent article, regardless of the assigned permissions.  Articles are sequentially numbered, which would allow an actor exploiting this vulnerability to gain read-only access to all FLEXIcontent articles by iterating through article identifiers.  --------------- POC: --------------- http://host/index.php/content_page/#/#?task=abcd http://host/index.php/content_page/2/6?task=foo http://host/index.php/content_page/2/7?task=foo http://host/index.php?option=com_flexicontent&view=item&id=#&task=abcd (if Search Engine Friendly URLs are disabled)  ------------- Solution: ------------- Upgrade to or greater  ----------------------------- Disclosure Timeline: ----------------------------- Notified FLEXIcontent author of vulnerability.
