The following  plugin releases published today contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  - Active Directory 2.3 - DistFork Plugin - Email Extension (email-ext) - Mailer Plugin - SSH Slaves  Users of these plugins should upgrade them to the indicated versions.  Additionally, one plugin was removed from distribution as there are no plans  to fix its vulnerability, and there are adequate alternatives:  - Pipeline: Classpath Step  Summary and description of the vulnerabilities are below. Some more details,  severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you find security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as  described here: https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  / SSH Slaves Plugin did not verify host keys of hosts it connected to.  / Active Directory Plugin did not verify TLS certificate of AD server.  / Pipeline: Classpath Step plugin allows Script Security sandbox bypass for  users with SCM commit access, as well as users with e.g. Job/Configure  permission in Jenkins.  / (Mailer) / (Email Extension) Emails could be sent to addresses not associated with actual users of Jenkins  by Mailer Plugin and Email Extension Plugin if they were configured to send  notifications to a dynamically created list of users based on SCM changes. In  rare cases this even resulted in emails sent to people who were not involved  in whatever project was being built.  / There were no permission checks performed in the Distributed Fork plugin  beyond the basic check for Overall/Read permission, allowing anyone with that  permission to run arbitrary shell commands on all connected nodes.
