Posting only a CFP and then nothing until next year's CFP sort of works on other lists, but not on oss-security.  Please re-read:   Unless there's anything from LSS besides this CFP posted to here until next year's, I am going to reject next year's LSS CFP, as we should have been doing per the published oss-security guidelines in the first place.  The same applies to other events focused on open source security, including non-Linux ones: CFPs only "no", generally useful material from such events "probably yes", CFPs from events for which there were other accepted postings "possibly yes".  Currently I don't recall any events with relevant focus that bothered communicating their materials to here, but they should have (if any of the substance could be provided in text/plain; for videos only, no).  For events not focused on open source security, I intend to make no exceptions regarding CFPs, not even if some materials were relevant and discussed in here.  So overall our "no CFPs" policy is still in place.  This applies to oss-security only.  Having this same CFP on the kernel-hardening list is OK and desirable.  (And it's already there.)

Another good resource are Kees Cook's blog posts on "security things" in each new Linux kernel release:   and his other blog posts as well, such as on security bugs' lifetime.  These are so much more useful (or rather, to more people) than a CFP with no follow-ups.  I wish Kees, James, and others posted this kind of material in here in text/plain, in addition to blogging.
