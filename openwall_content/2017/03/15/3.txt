For instance, the software list for contains “cpe:/a:littlecms:little_cms_color_engine”, which theoretically means that it applies to any version of lcms.  The problem is automated tools cannot exploit such entries in practice because they cannot tell which package versions are affected.  While tuning our CVE tracking tool in GNU Guix, we found that such entries are not uncommon:     What are the possibilities to address this issue?  I can think of two actions that could perhaps be taken:    1. The software behind the CVE form could force submitters to specify      version numbers.    2. For recent entries (say, 2 years old at most), a bot could email      the original submitters kindly asking them to provide the missing      version info.  Thoughts?  Thanks, Ludo’.
