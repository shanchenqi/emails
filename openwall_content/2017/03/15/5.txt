Sometimes the software is abaondware, and no fix will ever be available. Sometimes the software is a hobby and only fun features get implemented but difficult fixes do not. Sometimes the fix will be in the next release.  >   2.

I know some submitters who would probably have to invest in new /dev/null procmail entries if we mailed them once for every CVE they've been issued. :)  I suspect the solution is for people who rely upon these scanning tools to do the leg work themselves on the packages they care about. (i.e., the packages that annoy them the most.)
