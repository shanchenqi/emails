A fuzz on libpcre1 through the pcretest utility revealed an invalid memory read. Upstream says that this bug is fixed by one of the previous commit. However Iâm providing as usual the stacktrace and the  reproducer, so if you are not running the latest upstream release, like happen on debian/rhel based distros, you may want to check better the status of this bug.  The complete ASan output:  # pcretest -32 -d $FILE AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address (pc bp sp T0) signal is caused by a READ memory access.     #0 in _pcre32_xclass     #1 in match     #2 in pcre32_exec     #3 in main     #4 in __libc_start_main     #5 in _init  AddressSanitizer can not provide additional info.
