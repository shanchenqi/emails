A fuzz on libpcre1 through the pcretest utility revealed two stack overflow write. Upstream says that these bugs are fixed by one of the previous commit. However Iâm providing as usual the stacktrace  and the reproducer, so if you are not running the latest upstream release, like happen on debian/rhel based distros, you may want to check better the status of this bug.
