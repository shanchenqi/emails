A fuzz on libpcre1 through the pcretest utility revealed a null pointer dereference in the utility itself. For the nature of the crash, it is not security relevant because the library is not affected  but if you have a web application that calls directly the pcretest utility to parse untrusted data, then you are affected. Also, it is important share the details because some distros/packagers may want to take the patch in their repository.  The complete ASan output:  # pcretest -16 -d $FILE AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address (pc bp sp T0) signal is caused by a READ memory access. address points to the zero page.     #0 in main     #1 in __libc_start_main     #2 in _init   Affected version:  Fixed version: (not released atm)  Commit fix:  Credit: This bug was discovered by Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo.  CVE: N/A  Reproducer:  Timeline: bug discovered and reported to upstream upstream released a patch blog post about the issue  Note: This bug was found with American Fuzzy Lop.
