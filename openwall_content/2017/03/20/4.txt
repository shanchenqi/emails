A fuzz on libpcre1 through the pcretest utility revealed an invalid read in the library. For who is interested in a detailed description of the bug, will follow a feedback from upstream:  This was a genuine bug in the 32-bit library. Thanks for finding it. The crash was caused by trying to find a Unicode property for a code value greater than the Unicode maximum, when running  in non-UTF mode (where character values can be up to 0xffffffff). The bug was in both PCRE1 and PCRE2. I have fixed both of them.  The complete ASan output:  # pcretest -32 -d $FILE AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address (pc bp sp T0) signal is caused by a READ memory access.     #0 in match     #1 in pcre32_exec     #2 in main     #3 in __libc_start_main     #4 in _init  AddressSanitizer can not provide additional info.
