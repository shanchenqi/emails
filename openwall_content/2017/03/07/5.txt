This is a simple fact.  Now ideally the Wordpress team would become a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) and cover it themselves, if they would like to do this then they need to reach out to me as the DWF guy and I can make that happen.  If that doesn't happen then the good news is we have another option now. Someone can become a CVEMentor and CNA and take over the Wordpress assignments (well until Wordpress becomes a CNA). So if someone wants to step up and do this, please contact me as the DWF guy and I can make that happen.  This is also true for other projects/open source products. We need better CVE coverage. Ideally these projects/products step up and become CNA's, but if they cannot (lack of resources/time/etc) that's ok, because now people with an interest can come forwards and do it.
