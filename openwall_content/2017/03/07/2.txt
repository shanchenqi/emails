Fixed in Apache NiFi and  Apache NiFi Unauthorized Data Access In Cluster Environment  Severity: Important  Versions Affected:  Apache NiFi Apache NiFi Apache NiFi Apache NiFi Description: In a cluster environment, if an anonymous user request is replicated to another node, the originating node identity is used rather than the âanonymousâ user.  Mitigation: A fix has been provided (removing the negative check for anonymous user before building the proxy chain and throwing an exception, and evaluating each user in the proxy chain iteration and comparing against a static constant anonymous user).

Mitigation: A fix has been provided (modification of the tokenization code and sanitization of user-provided input). This fix was applied in and released in Apache NiFi and 1.x users running a clustered environment should upgrade to 0.x users running a clustered environment should upgrade to  Credit: This issue was discovered by Andy LoPresto.
