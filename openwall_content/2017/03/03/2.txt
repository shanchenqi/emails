Can you clarify if the "soon" above is supposed to mean days, weeks, or months?  Two weeks have passed since the above, and I've not seen any update from you.  Note that I'm only asking for CVE mappings for issues that were publicly fixed and mentioned in release notes mid-Dec, listed in Oracle CPU mid-Jan, and had enough technical details noted in this thread or other public bug reports.  Only giving CVE names to known issues does not hurt anyone, and it actually helps downstreams and users already hurt by upstream's proprietary attitude towards this open-source project.  Of course, it's up to your discretion if and when to release working exploits, videos, etc.  Thank you!  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
