Thanks for the report. I just tried to reproduce the issue on Ubuntu with which is the package patched for the issue that I announced in this thread. I couldn't reproduce it.  I then installed an old based deb and still couldn't reproduce it.  I'd suggest opening an upstream bug here:    https://github.com/lxc/lxc/issues/new  (Normally, they prefer private security bugs on Launchpad but your report to this list is already public so I don't see a need.)
