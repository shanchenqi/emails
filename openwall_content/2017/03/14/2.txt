It could  occur when Vnc client attempts to update its display after a vga operation is  performed by a guest.  A privileged user/process inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu  process resulting in DoS OR potentially leverage it to execute arbitrary code  on the host with privileges of the Qemu process.
