As stated in my reply to Serge H. Hallyn's off-list message, in the meantime I have installed version from jessie-backports and am unable to reproduce the issue, as I cannot start unprivileged containers anymore (due to a network error). According to Debian's tracker page for lxc, the version that I have installed from backports is which does not include latest upstream fixes. I guess that I have to wait for the package - which includes latest upstream fixes - to land in jessie-backports for these issues (both security and functional) to be fixed.  CC-ing the Debian address for this bug, as they explicitly asked to do this in case there is a need to reopen the Debian bug, which seems to be the case here (at least, for Jessie, since the intermediary .deb apparently breaks unprivileged networking, besides not fixing the security issue). To the Debian team in charge of this bug: As unprivileged mode is not activated by default on Debian, I understand that this is not a priority, but it would still be nice to have this fixed quickly. By the way, not directly related to this specific bug, but I hope that snapd + LXD somehow finds its way into jessie-backports: that would be great!

Thanks for the report. I just tried to reproduce the issue on Ubuntu with which is the package patched for the issue that I announced in this thread. I couldn't reproduce it.  I then installed an old based deb and still couldn't reproduce it.  I'd suggest opening an upstream bug here:  https://github.com/lxc/lxc/issues/new  (Normally, they prefer private security bugs on Launchpad but your report to this list is already public so I don't see a need.)
