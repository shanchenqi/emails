Each failed authentication attempt will leak a file descriptor in gnome-session.  When the maximum number of file descriptors is exhausted in the gnome-session process, it will enter an infinite loop trying to communicate without success, consuming of the CPU. The graphical session associated with the gnome-session process will stop working correctly, because communication with gnome-session is no longer possible.  This was fixed with the following commit:   The problem seems to be that upon connection establishment gms_store_add() is called, but not gsm_store_remove(), even if the authentication of the ICE connection fails.  You can find a proof of concept program attached.  References:   Regards  Matthias  --  Matthias Gerstner <matthias.gerstner@...e.de> Dipl.-Wirtsch.-Inf.
