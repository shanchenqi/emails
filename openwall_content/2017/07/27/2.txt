These instructions use the carry flag to report success or failure, and GCC used to generate instruction sequences which clobbered the flag before applications had a change to read it:       Practical impact is hopefully limited because the intrinsics are difficult to use due to an unrelated GCC usability issue, and inline assembly is not impacted by this issue.
