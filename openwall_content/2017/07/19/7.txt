A buffer overflow   can cause an open unsecured server to crash or malfunction after 2GB is   received."  Unfortunately, the subversion repo on sourceforge for gSOAP only has full releases, not individual changes, in each commit, so the fix appears to be somewhere mixed in on https://sourceforge.net/p/gsoap2/code/commit_browser making it a challenge for distros who want to patch instead of upgrade.  --  	-Alan Coopersmith-               alan.coopersmith@...cle.com 	 Oracle Solaris Engineering - https://blogs.oracle.com/alanc  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
