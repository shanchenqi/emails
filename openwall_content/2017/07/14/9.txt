Some of them can be remotely exploited, some require a local user to take action.  Some give access to those who had none, some give higher privs to those who had some, and some don't change your access levels at all.  Of course, they don't count all the ones that haven't been publicly disclosed - either because they are unknown or only known to certain people.  And when you start comparing numbers with Linux distros things get even messier - if you include the count of every issue in every package in their package repositories then you are including a far larger set of software than if you just count what's in others OS - but that doesn't mean they are more or less secure, just that they have more or less software available for easy installation.  For a far more complete answer of why vulnerability counting is messy, hard, and just plain sucks, you can turn to the experts:   --  	-Alan Coopersmith-               alan.coopersmith@...cle.com 	 Oracle Solaris Engineering - https://blogs.oracle.com/alanc  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
