Red Hat will continue to help (let's pick #1 and #2 > explicitly),  What's #1 and #2 - do you mean the technical or the administrative tasks?  Technical are:  1. Propose (other) ways to fix, work around, or mitigate the reported issues  2. Develop and share fixes, workarounds, or mitigations  and currently these are vacant.  Administrative are:  1. Promptly review new issue reports for meeting the list's requirements and confirm receipt of the report and, when necessary, inform the reporter of any issues with their report (e.g., obviously not actionable by the distros) and request and/or propose any required yet missing information (most notably, a tentative public disclosure date) - primary: CloudLinux, backup: vacant  2. If the proposed public disclosure date is not within list policy, insist on getting this corrected and propose a suitable earlier date - primary: CloudLinux, backup: vacant  As you can see, the primary distro for them is currently CloudLinux, and as discussed in here I'd like each new distro joining to take at least task 1, unless they strongly prefer something else.  There's currently no backup, so I will gladly list Red Hat as backup here if you confirm.  > I know we already have more than 2 people on the list so I > don't think we need to nominate a backup?  If you're confident you'll fully handle a task without needing a backup distro, then we may list that as such.  Right now, you do have Debian listed as backup for the CVE tasks, though.
