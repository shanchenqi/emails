As a metric it likely doesn't provide much though; a high number of tracked issues are fixed without GLSA, depending on severity and expected install base of the package, and multiple fixes are combined into single GLSAs if related to same package etc, so as a metric it is probably quite bad and number depending on factors such as available manpower from year to year.  --  Kristian Fiskerstrand OpenPGP keyblock reachable at hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net fpr:94CB AFDD 35AA 0B7F E3ED FAE3    Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
