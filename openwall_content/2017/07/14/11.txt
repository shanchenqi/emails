One method of answering this question is to take the number of GLSAs, RHSAs, and USNs depending on which distro you want to track. If you multiply that number by 2, you'll have a reasonable guess. There's no guarantee that this number will be accurate because many bugs will last years or decades and many never become CVEs and thus won't become RHSAs, GLSAs, or USNs. Many bugs that are fixed in were present in Some fixed in weren't there in  https://security.gentoo.org/glsa https://access.redhat.com/security/ https://www.ubuntu.com/usn/  Here is the code for Gentoo: for year in do echo -n "$year "; ls -1 /usr/portage/metadata/glsa/glsa-"$year"* |wc -l; done 43 47 98 97  This shows that GLSAs are neither increasing nor decreasing within the margin of error over the past 10 years.
