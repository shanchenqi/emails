Do consider the caveat brought up by other people on the list: CVE numbers are not a 1:1 mapping to bugs (or even exploitable bugs). For example, there are vendors that group all bugs discovered in a period (or with a conceputal similarity) under one CVE number, whereas others take mutliple variations of a bug and request an individual CVE for each. Needless to say, some bugs never get a CVE ;).  > Also, does the total number decrease, increase or change in other way > over time?  You could use the json api[2] on [1] to get a rolling count if you'd like to measure this (also pasted on [3]]):  >>> import json, requests >>> response = requests.get("https://security.archlinux.org/vulnerable/json") >>> data = json.loads(response.content) >>> len(data) 34  Cheers! -Santiago.
