Do we go with "all" the packages shipped? Ok... what about things like firefox? https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=firefox CVEs... does that count to the distribtion count?  What about non-free in Debian? Anyone that ships Flash is also going to see their stats bumped way up.  Now we need to define "exploitable bugs", for example an exploit chain, is that multiple bugs or do we count that as a single one for this discussion? There's a lot of /tmp flaws that are "exploitable" but I can pretty much guarantee nobody will ever bother.  I would then point out the only source of data anyone is mentioning is CVE. And CVE has counting rules. For example if you find XSS flaws in a php app (because they forgot to use htmlspecialchars on output) in the same version we'll assign a single CVE, not So how many bugs do you count this as?  CVE is also incomplete. There's lots and lots of vulns with no CVE (something I'm trying to remediate with the DWF).  I would suggest before anyone continue this thread they go read:   it's largely a pointless discussion because the question isn't well defined, and we know for a fact we don't have good data to answer it (yet...).   --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
