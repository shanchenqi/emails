I didn't collect statistics, but my impression is that Red Hat generally works on fixes for issues that Red Hat itself brings to distros, which is a great contribution (doubly so).  Red Hat also worked on glibc fixes for Stack Clash.  Other than that, for issues brought to distros by third-parties I think Red Hat's contributions of fixes do not stand out compared to some other distros'.  Maybe that will now improve. :-)  And I am not complaining.  Maybe this means those other distros are doing their part too, which is great.  > On Jul 14, at Solar Designer <solar@...nwall.com> wrote: > > Technical are: > >  > > 1.
