Maybe that will now improve. :-) >  To be clear we won't be working on random third party stuff that has minimal value and we have no expertise in. It's the things like StackGuard or OpenSSL issues that matter and where a major amount of work is needed that we tend to work on (we're not going to work on random php apps, we're going to work on the stuff that matters, not all security issues are equal).  I would argue if people can't be bothered to care about committing resources to fixing  a security issue than that security issue doesn't really matter (in other words, the market has spoken).    > And I am not complaining.
