I've listed Debian as backup for the two CVE tasks above.  I've also listed Red Hat as primary for these two tasks, based on Red Hat's contributions so far.  And I've listed Cloud Linux and Gentoo beside the tasks they kindly volunteered for in postings in here.  I see that Gentoo is already active at their tasks, including reminding reporters to post to oss-security and taking care of the SPICE posting (when the reporter wasn't available to make it on time):   as well as collecting statistics.

This doesn't mean they're not getting done - just that no particular distro is responsible - yet that's something I'd like to see change.  Specifically, all 6 of the technical tasks and 5 of 13 administrative tasks are now fully vacant.  Additionally, 11 of the administrative tasks have no backup.  These distros have no task assigned: ALT Linux, Amazon Linux AMI, Arch Linux, Chrome OS, Openwall, Oracle, Slackware, SUSE, Ubuntu, Wind River, FreeBSD, NetBSD/pkgsrc.  Openwall might be exempt for now for us running the lists and being the last resort fallback for most tasks. ;-)  The rest should volunteer for some tasks now!  Red Hat almost made this list, except that I listed them for the two CVE tasks on my own.  http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros#contributing-back  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
