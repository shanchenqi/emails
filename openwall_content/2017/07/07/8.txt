ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  When polling event channels, in general arbitrary port numbers can be specified.  Specifically, there is no requirement that a polled event channel ports has ever been created.  When the code was generalised from an earlier implementation, introducing some intermediate pointers, a check should have been made that these intermediate pointers are non-NULL.  However, that check was omitted.  IMPACT ======  A malicious or buggy guest may cause the hypervisor to access addresses it doesn't control, usually leading to a host crash (Denial of Service).  Information leaks cannot be excluded.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen versions 4.4 and newer are vulnerable.  Xen versions 4.3 and earlier are not affected.  Both x86 and ARM systems are vulnerable.  While all guest kinds can cause a Denial of Service, only x86 PV guests may be able to leverage the possible information leaks.  MITIGATION ==========  There is no known mitigation.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Ankur Arora of Oracle.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            Xen 4.4.x and later, including xen-unstable  $  $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)  For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information, consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:   http://www.xenproject.org/security-policy.html -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =HElV -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
