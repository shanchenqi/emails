It is possible to create a specially crafted node name that does not exist as part of the cluster and point it to a malicious node. This can trick the nodes in cluster to believe that the malicious node is a member of the cluster. So, if Solr users have enabled BasicAuth authentication mechanism using the BasicAuthPlugin or if the user has implemented a custom Authentication plugin, which does not implement either "HttpClientInterceptorPlugin" or "HttpClientBuilderPlugin", his/her servers are vulnerable to this attack. Users who only use SSL without basic authentication or those who use Kerberos are not affected.  Mitigation: 6.x users should upgrade to 6.6 5.x users should obtain the latest source from git and apply this patch: http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene-solr/commit/2f5ecbcf  Credit: This issue was discovered by Noble Paul of Lucidworks Inc.
