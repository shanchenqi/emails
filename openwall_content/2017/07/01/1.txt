We (Wind River) can take a more active role in at least some of the administrative tasks..  However, I can assure you we don't have the time or ability to do it ourselves.  So the more then one 'actor' on an action would definitely be what I suggest.  Unfortunately I really don't have a good sense (based on the link to the tasks) as to what would be appropriate to volunteer for.  I'm open to suggestions.  --Mark  > With multiple distros listed, there will need to be some coordination > between them - e.g., inform each other when transferring responsibility > (such as before several people go on vacation), or separate duties by > time of day. >  > I agree that for something as simple as getting back to message senders > this might not be worth the coordination.
