I think that in that line, applying for institutional funding through calls for public-private partnerships such as and similar non-European initiatives - if there are any - would be more than appropriate, as Linux is a core privacy-enhancing technology, in addition to the fact that "Open source and externally auditable solutions are encouraged in order to maximise uptake and increase the trustworthiness of proposed solutions.". By the way, the same would apply for BSDs, where I have a more direct interest, although they do not share Linux's European heritage! ;)  Thank you for thinking outside the box and suggesting this, but no, "in relation with the "distros" list" (in your words), let's not apply for any funding.  Here are some reasons why not, in arbitrary order:  1. The costs of hosting one old server for the distros list are small.  2. The effort of administering that system is also small. (*)  3. The effort of handling the administrative tasks is also small - I shared my estimate of it in the previous message I sent to this thread.  4. I think this effort is best spread across the distros, and that's not because one entity could not bear the full "cost" (I think many could), but because we should prefer to have all distros visibly involved and responsible (if a distro isn't, maybe they shouldn't stay subscribed).  5. The effort that may be put into the technical expertise roles/tasks is ideally not small, but I think it's best that capable distros themselves take care of it.  This means they're paying their employees to do this sort of work for the distros community. (**)  6. Which entity would accept the funding?  How would it distribute the funds to entities/people doing the actual work?  How transparent would it be?  At least this adds overhead, but it also brings us to:  7. Let's not unnecessarily add to the controversy and thus to potential conspiracy theories inherently surrounding embargoes and funding.  (*) I admit there are things we probably could do better with greater effort.  For example, we could rewrite from scratch and release as Open Source the encrypted mailing list software, which is currently an awful hack.  I wouldn't oppose doing that piece of software development under a separate funded project, if capable people were available for that. However, I am worried that most teams tasked to work on something like this would produce a complex monster, which wouldn't otherwise be directly comparable (as in: is it better or worse? is it more or less secure?) to the current hack.  (**) A month ago, we also started to accept capable and trusted volunteers.  I am currently undecided on whether this should change if some distros accept responsibility for all of the same roles.  It would seem unfair to use these volunteers' time when the distros are paying their employees to do similar work, whereas the volunteers join in their individual capacity independent from their employment.  As to "focusing on Linux kernel security" (also in your words), we already see how something like this is happening with KSPP.  Various companies pay their employees to do portions of the work, Linux Foundation funds a few other people's work, and there are many volunteers.  All of this is met with criticism, controversy, and conspiracy theories.  Yet the project proceeds, even if arguably slowly and inefficiently.  Overall, would it benefit from or be hurt by more funding, or by an extra funding source?  I don't know.  Funding creates an incentive to work on and push academic security detached from real-world threats.  That said, with no formal entity behind KSPP, lucky people may choose whether and how they want their potential contributions funded.  I guess someone or a team could apply for a grant under then participate in KSPP.  This might or might not be a good thing.  I think funded work generally has lower efficiency than volunteer work, and I also think that's fine.  Ditto for coordinated effort rather than independent work.  Low efficiency is part of the criticism, but I think this is not entirely justified - that's just how things work in funded and larger projects (in people count, not LOC).  I say this in relation to KSPP.  I think we don't need to go for this for the distros list.
