I run two businesses, one of which hosts other hosting providers, and we are heavy users of CloudLinux. They work very hard to contribute to fixing issues whether the upstream has fixed it or not, and I see tremendous value in that. I think they should be added.  Thanks!

I'd appreciate any comments.  On Sun, Jul 02, at Igor Seletskiy wrote: > I would like to apply for membership in linux-distros list for  > CloudLinux OS. Please, see application attached.

So are you saying that you'll release fixes sooner (once you're on the linux-distros list) only for this subset of packages that are modified or packaged by you?

OK.  You'll likely need to choose additional/other tasks very soon since these trivial ones will likely transfer to another new distro joining, if one requests membership and meets the criteria shortly after you.  > Please, find PGP related info  Thanks.  Out of the people you listed, you and Konstantin appear to have been on oss-security for a long while, but Leonid doesn't appear to be subscribed - or is he?  If not, he probably needs to subscribe now.  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
