This makes sense.  Text files, then? ;-)  On a more serious note, I am concerned that the person collecting statistics, etc. might end up entering the data into some online system, thereby incurring unnecessary risk.  We should ask the volunteering distros/people how they are processing the information, to discourage such occurrences.  And text files is what I would use.  Seriously.  Much more convenient than an online system like Bugzilla for the low volume we're handling.  > What do you think about having a public bugzilla (or similar system) > where tracked issues are kept as private bugs?

No way for you all to check and confirm that as well, though.  Now, I understand that many of the distros are probably entering stuff into their bug trackers anyway.  Often on shared or/and centrally managed systems.  I hope most only do so for bugs that are actually relevant to them, or at least that are likely to be relevant.  Maybe we should make this limitation part of list policy ("do not enter the newly arriving issues into bug trackers unless and until you're reasonably confident the issues are relevant to you")?  Or forbid use of bug trackers for the embargoed issues arriving through the distros list altogether, but I'm quite sure many of the existing distros list members won't accept that. :-(  > In addition to helping to make sure there's clear information (like a > summary, current patches, etc), I think the Project Zero approach of > making a private bug public post-embargo helps share information and > provide more transparency after the event.  Yes, at P0 they definitely do the transparency thing well.  Better than us so far.  But they're also extremely courageous to have the info in a public-facing web app for up to 90 days.  I wouldn't dare.  We shouldn't.  To improve transparency, I'd rather see someone write a mass-decrypter for mbox with OpenPGP messages.  > I'm not suggesting that a bug tracker eliminate the discussions on the > list, but really just supplement it.

Thank you, but I hope we won't go that route.  BTW, your messages' text/plain parts don't always differentiate your added text vs. the previous message's quoted text - e.g., I had to correct that manually in your reply to Kristian while it was in the moderation queue.  I hope you don't mind; the alternative was rejecting the message as it was a total mess.  I had to look at the text/html part to figure out what came from where.
