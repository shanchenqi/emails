I'd appreciate any comments.  On Sun, Jul 02, at Igor Seletskiy wrote: > I would like to apply for membership in linux-distros list for CloudLinux > OS. Please, see application attached.  Thank you for posting this, Igor.  I am most concerned about your answer to:  > 4.

So are you saying that you'll release fixes sooner (once you're on the linux-distros list) only for this subset of packages that are modified or packaged by you?

OK.  You'll likely need to choose additional/other tasks very soon since these trivial ones will likely transfer to another new distro joining, if one requests membership and meets the criteria shortly after you.  > Please, find PGP related info  Thanks.  Out of the people you listed, you and Konstantin appear to have been on oss-security for a long while, but Leonid doesn't appear to be subscribed - or is he?  If not, he probably needs to subscribe now.  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
