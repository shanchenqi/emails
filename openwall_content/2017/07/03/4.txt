It wouldn't take much to have a tool that does, mainly what I outline in the previous post to ensure OpenPGP keyblock management for the individual users, and as an extension of the scope for that perhaps a [MemoryHole] implementation to ensure confidentiality / integrity verification of the headers such as Subject.
