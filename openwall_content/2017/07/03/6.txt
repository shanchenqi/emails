Sometimes, of course, it only becomes apparent that it's not relevant after some work has been done.  What I would say though is that embargoed issues that go on a bug tracker should be not be visible to anyone that doesn't have an actual need to know.  If an internal bug tracker is generally open to anyone internal then for the purposes of embargo it might as well be public.  It _should_ be self-evident that "need to know" includes making sure entries in internal bug trackers need to be similarly restricted but I do wonder if it's worth calling that out explicitly?  jch   PS For contributing back I have given myself a "must try harder" mark.
