OK, let's do it this way: you list some tasks and say whether you'd like to be "primary" or "backup" for them (could be different for each task), and we find other distros to fill the other role for each task.  Other distros are welcome to state what they volunteer for in the same way: choose "primary" or "backup", as long as neither is taken yet.  > Unfortunately I'm on vacation through the end of this week (as are many of us > that are located in North America.)

(If tasks are gone, we may nevertheless find some for you, but you'll have less freedom of choice.)
