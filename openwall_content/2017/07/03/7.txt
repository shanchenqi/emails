I think "might as well be public" is an exaggeration, but this would in fact be against distros list policy.  > It _should_ be self-evident that "need to know" includes making sure > entries in internal bug trackers need to be similarly restricted but I > do wonder if it's worth calling that out explicitly?  You're right.  I'm not sure.  This isn't the only thing we could call out explicitly.  If we start listing examples of what's allowed and what's not, then another one or two would be about testing/QA of fixes, which Gentoo's internal "Pre-Release Disclosure of Vulnerability Information" policy mentions explicitly:  https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Security/Pre-Release-Disclosure  I added a link to it to the distros list wiki page yesterday, referring to it as an example.  If we include such examples directly in the list policy specification, it'd become lengthy and redundant, and I don't want it to be.  Maybe this should be a set of examples clarifying yet separate from the list policy specification.  > PS For contributing back I have given myself a "must try harder" mark.  Thanks.  Please let us know at which specific tasks you'll try harder.
