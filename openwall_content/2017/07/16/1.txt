Why doesn't the CVE data have information of the fixed in version even it's clearly available in the reference data, which refers to URL showing that the vulnerabilities are fixed in version? Isn't it supposed to be available in CVE database? I'm just trying to understand how DWF works, because it's not very clear to me.  How long it usually takes that DWF assigned CVEs end up being added to MITRE and NVD databases?  I can't actually see contents of upstream bug report even I registered user-account:  Is this assigment somehow related to this oss-security post?  This has also been pending for over a year. Is this related to these new assigments or does this still need new CVE?  Also I noticed following text in the DWF-CVE-Database README.md: "Please note that some of the data from and needs to be brought up to date to the current JSON v.4 format, if you'd like to do this please do so and submit a pull request." isn't this something that should be done by DWF maintainers and maybe the CVE mentors and not wait pull requests?   --  Henri Salo  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
