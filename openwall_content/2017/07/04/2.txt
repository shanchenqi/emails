Some comments below:  On Sun, Jul 02, at Igor Seletskiy wrote: > We typically have to patch local privilege escalations in kernel asap as > our customers are easily rooted using this type of vulnerabilities (anyone > can buy website or hack old wordpress instance & run any code).  This may be a reason for you to harden your distro's userland against local privilege escalations as well, such as by adopting the owl-alt-sanitize-env glibc hardening patch maintained by ALT Linux:   and getting rid of most or all world-accessible SUID programs, which is do-able like we have demonstrated with Owl.  This shouldn't be unreasonably hard to implement and maintain in a fork of RHEL, although obviously you'll end up with more packages (including some core ones) that would no longer be mere rebuilds of RHEL's.  This is by no means a condition for your linux-distros list membership - I just happen to mention it here in response to your explanation of your distro's threat model.  If you do go this route, it will re-enforce your reasoning for being a linux-distros member, though.  > Some records: > The stack clash (Jun 21, > > Dirty Cow (Oct 21rd, > https://www.cloudlinux.com/cloudlinux-os-blog/entry/cloudlinux-6-kernel-updated-dirty-cow-issue-fixed > Ghost (Jan 27, >  You got impressive timing on these!  > Please, find PGP related info >  > Leonid Kanter <lkanter@...udlinux.com> >  > GPG Key: (download > <https://cryptup.org/pub/lkanter@cloudlinux.com>) > GPG Fingerprint: A07D AA47  9AE5 >  > Igor Seletskiy <i@...udlinux.com> >  > GPG Key: (download > <https://cryptup.org/pub/i@cloudlinux.com>) >  > GPG Fingerprint: 7FE3 DCBC A2FF CD7B B36D 7E0D >  > Konstantin Olshanov <kolshanov@...udlinux.com> > GPG Key: (download > <https://cryptup.org/pub/kolshanov@cloudlinux.com>) > GPG Fingerprint: 0D7C BB2C  FBDC 1FDB F34E D0FD  I subscribed only Leonid and Igor so far, since Konstantin's key doesn't appear to be available at that URL (I am getting "No Public Key found for kolshanov@...udlinux.com").  As a minor annoyance, these URLs appear to require JavaScript.
