I've just added Konstantin as well.  All - going forward, I think we don't need to discuss the individual people's subscriptions to (linux-)distros on oss-security, including for newly joining distros - I can handle that off-list, including making sure there's a "vouching chain".  That's how it has been for changes in who's subscribed for the already accepted distros anyway.  The need for a discussion on oss-security is only about the joining distros, not about their team members, as long as at least one person is vouched for.
