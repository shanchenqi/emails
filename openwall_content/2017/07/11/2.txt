For libraries, this could leak some information about the audio converted for other users, possibly revealing it to the attacker. For one-shot conversions with a command-line tool, this is unlikely, but the uninitialized memory could still end up leaking some system-specific secrets (e.g., ASLR memory layout, credentials, etc).  Not that this is necessarily a risk here; depends on how much memory is accessed, what happens with it later on, whether anyone is even using the library / tool this way, whether doing so is sane in the first place, etc.  /mz  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
