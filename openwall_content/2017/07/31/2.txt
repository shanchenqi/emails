Both messages posted initially had the Subject of "CVE request: kernel stack infoleaks", which I changed to the two more specific Subjects before approving the messages.  (I do that to especially non-descriptive Subjects from time to time, as long as the messages were not CC'ed to elsewhere.  I leave message bodies entirely intact.)  Thus, wanted to request the CVEs from this list, and apparently didn't request them elsewhere.  this list is no longer a place to request CVEs from, but we appreciate the vulnerability notifications. You may request the CVEs from https://cveform.mitre.org and then post them in here, "replying" to your own messages on the list.  have you also reported these issues upstream?  For the net/irda/af_irda.c issue, from the MAINTAINERS file:  IRDA SUBSYSTEM M:      Samuel Ortiz <samuel@...tiz.org> L:      irda-users@...ts.sourceforge.net (subscribers-only) L:      netdev@...r.kernel.org W:      http://irda.sourceforge.net/ S:      Maintained T:      git git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sameo/irda-2.6.git F:      Documentation/networking/irda.txt F:      drivers/net/irda/ F:      include/net/irda/ F:      net/irda/  For the driver/video/fbdev/aty/atyfb_base.c issue I guess it's linux-fbdev@...r.kernel.org, although there's no perfect match for that filename.  In both cases, CC the messages to LKML.  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
