Quoting his report:  > Dear Maintainer, >  > In its default configuration, yadm ensures that .ssh/ and .gnupg/ files are > readable by the owner only.  That is implemented by running 'chmod' on the > files after they have been created: >  >     >  > That way has a race condition: whilst the git worktree is being checked out, > the .ssh and .gnupg files have the permissions of the user's umask.  I added a > debug printf just before the 'chmod' and it showed .ssh/ and .ssh/config having > permissions ÂŤu=rwX,go=rXÂť, i.e., world readable.  Upstream bugreport: https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm/issues/74  MITRE has assigned for this issue.
