An attacker is able to cause O(n) lookup for hash tables by predicting the buckets in which interned symbols will end up, due to a partially incorrect fix for where the randomization factor was determined before initializing the PRNG with a seed state.  This issue affects only the Scheme symbol table, not user-created hash tables.  All CHICKEN releases up to and including are affected.
