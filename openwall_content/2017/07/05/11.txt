Some of these messages get through (those that include [vs-plain] in the Subject), the rest don't.  (It might as well be several threads now.)  This makes little sense to me, and it also creates the situation that if any new security issues are disclosed in that thread (which might or might not be the case with LibreOffice and Java trying and failing to install their own stack guard pages after the kernel has been patched, if I read this right) then per linux-distros list policy we'd need to bring them specifically to oss-security (but it's tough to do when the thread doesn't make the issue reports explicit - rather, people are just discussing things).  On one hand, this is our continuing reminder of just how very wrong we were with the embargo.  (Of course, some of us will continue to disagree with this assessment.)  On the other hand, perhaps we should forcibly kill those CC's now - ask people to stop, or just filter on the server. I am going to start by asking.  Once again, that content is public on LKML anyway.
