The worst is that fact that discussion about this problem was locked in upstream bugtracker. Therefore there is no other option as continue discussion about this, which I think security issue, here at oss-security list. But problem is that upstream do not have to monitor this list and therefore they would ignore any results.  > FWIW, I'd be inclined to agree that it needs a CVE so that downstream > distro's can at least refer to it, and decide how (and if) they want to > address it.

Either patching systemd or change validation for adding new user names into system...  Is somebody going to ask Mitre for CVE? Or should it be done by Red Hat? Because upstream bug is locked, it is not possible to ask in upstream...  > I think the approach SUSE has taken is pretty good, and it's basically the > kind of fix I'd have liked to see upstream put in place (though in their > case, the suggestion of a config var to define whether it's acceptable is > also a very good suggestion).  --  Pali Rohรกr pali.rohar@...il.com  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
