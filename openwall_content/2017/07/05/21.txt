I wouldn't say > running the service as root falls under that definition, personally.  1) However, not all distributions enforce such a rule, and a has been noted, such a rule doesn't exist in POSIX. Indeed, a quick check on a PDP-11 simulator demonstrates that Unix at least back to v7 handled such names without trouble.  2) The lack of fail safety is disturbing. It is probably important for systems code like this to always fail safely, rather than unsafely.  > Honestly, I think upstream have done an *awful *job of handling it > so far (and it's far from the only example of Poettering taking the > not-a-bug approach questionably).  I've long since come to the conclusion that systemd is not safe to run on a security critical machine. The developers are simply too lax about safety.  If you're going to write a piece of systems code that has to run on essentially every Linux box on earth and which runs much of the time as root, extreme care has to be taken. You need to program defensively.  Instead, what we seem to have is a set of highly interdependent shotgun parsers written without much regard to the rules people have developed (of necessity) for writing code that must run with high privileges. In other words, the code is _not_ written defensively.  (For those not familiar with the term "shotgun parser", which the LangSec community introduced, do learn about it. It's a useful concept.)  > FWIW, I'd be inclined to agree that it needs a CVE so that > downstream distro's can at least refer to it, and decide how (and > if) they want to address it.  +1  I don't care much if the developers deny that this is a problem. It is a problem.  Perry --  Perry E.
