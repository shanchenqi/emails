The systemd mailing list is indexed by major search engines. I deliberately didn't provide a link, in the hope that a small barrier to entry will lead to fewer responses reiterating what has already been said, and a correspondingly greater chance of a response not getting lost in the noise from someone who has read the context and will propose a patch that achieves the desired result without breaking intended functionality (in particular "graceful degradation" when units released in upstream projects are interpreted by an older systemd, so that upstreams can opt-in to new security hardening flags without making their software inoperable in currently-deployed systemd versions).  Of course, if I was an exemplary open source developer I would have been spending my free time on writing that patch instead of getting drawn into conversations on oss-security, so perhaps this is partially my fault now.
