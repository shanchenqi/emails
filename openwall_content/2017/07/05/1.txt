I would like to announce another problem in DBD::mysql which affects only encryption between client and server. If you have fully trusted connection then you should not be affected.  Perl DBD::mysql driver does not enforce SSL/TLS encryption when option mysql_ssl=1 is enabled. Enabling encryption depends on announcement from MySQL server what it supports which can man-in-the-middle attack spoof. DBD::mysql does not enforce SSL/TSL encryption even when certificate is specified via connection parameter mysql_ssl_ca_file.  Therefore usage of SSL/TLS encryption in DBD::mysql is insecure.  Similar problem had also libmysqlclient.so library, see   --  Pali Rohรกr pali.rohar@...il.com  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
