The problem is in the handling of that failure. systemd interprets that failure as "this line is nonsense, so behave as though the line didn't exist" rather than "this line can be positively identified as an attempt to name a nonexistent or unacceptable user, so fail to load the unit". So User=7up does the same thing as User=0day - it doesn't run as uid 7, which is 'lp' on my Debian system.      % cat /etc/systemd/system/demo.service     [Unit]     Description=Demonstration      [Service]     Type=oneshot     ExecStart=/usr/bin/id     User=7up     % sudo systemctl daemon-reload     % sudo systemctl start demo.service     % sudo systemctl status demo.service     ...     Jul 05 host systemd[1]: /etc/systemd/system/demo.service:7:     Invalid user/group name or numeric ID, ignoring: 7up     Jul 05 host systemd[1]: Starting Demonstration...     Jul 05 host uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)     Jul 05 host systemd[1]: Started Demonstration.     Jul 05 host systemd[1]: /etc/systemd/system/demo.service:7:     Invalid user/group name or numeric ID, ignoring: 7up     Jul 05 host systemd[1]: /etc/systemd/system/demo.service:7:     Invalid user/group name or numeric ID, ignoring: 7up     Jul 05 host systemd[1]: /etc/systemd/system/demo.service:7:     Invalid user/group name or numeric ID, ignoring: 7up  (The error message in the Journal is presumably repeated because systemd re-parses User when looking for ExecStartPre, ExecStart, ExecStop and ExecStopPost commands, even though in this case there is only ExecStart.)  The default user to run system units, if no user is specified, is root, because for system services that's the right thing more often than not, analogous to how LSB init scripts always run as root and can drop privileges themselves if they want to.
