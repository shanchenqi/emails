Gentoo is offering to take all, or a subset of, [9, 11 - 13] as primary distribution: 9. Stay on top of issues to ensure progress is being made, remind others when there's no apparent progress, as well as when the public disclosure date for an issue is approaching and when it's finally reached (unless the reporter beats you to it by making their mandatory posting to oss-security first)  11. Make sure the mandatory oss-security posting is made promptly and is sufficiently detailed, and remind the reporter if not  12. If exploit(s) were shared on the list, make sure that either they're included in the oss-security posting along with the issue detail or the posting includes an announcement of planned later posting of the exploits (with the delay being within list policy), and in the latter case also make sure that the later posting is in fact made as planned, and remind the reporter if not  13. Keep track of per-report and per-issue handling and disclosure timelines (at least times of notification of the private list and of actual public disclosure), at regular intervals produce and share statistics (most notably, the average embargo duration) as well as the raw data (except on issues that are still under embargo) by posting to oss-security  --  Kristian Fiskerstrand OpenPGP keyblock reachable at hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net fpr:94CB AFDD 35AA 0B7F E3ED FAE3    Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
