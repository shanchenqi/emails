However "GenericEvents" can have any size, so if the events were sent in the wrong 	endianess, this stack buffer could be overflowed easily.  	So authenticated X users could overflow the stack in the X Server and with the X  	server usually running as root gaining root prileveges.     	An information leak out of the X server due to an uninitialized stack area when swapping 	event endianess.
