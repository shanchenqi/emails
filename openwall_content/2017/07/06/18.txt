That isn't appropriate for > all directives, hence  Finally. Thanks.  Now: Instead of closing the original issue as *not a bug*, it would have been  an approbiate reaction to fix the issue and then close the bug. This is what  upsets me most: Upstream developer behavior regarding the original github  issue was inapprobiate.  Taking the issue seriously from the beginning would additionally have avoided  all of the discussion here and elsewhere. What triggered the discussion was  that upstream developers basically explained "this is not a bug, go away" and  this… in my perception in an arrogant "we know better than you tone".  My hope is that some day the upstream developers of Systemd who handled the  original github issue the way they did, wake up… and reconsider whether their  behavior is approbiate and if not… change it. Cause from what I saw in the  last years, there is a pattern to handle bugs by quickly closing them as not a  bug. A pattern that even Linus himself criticized… rightfully so… in clear  words.  There is a social, a behavorial issue here… which IMHO is even more important  than the technical one.
