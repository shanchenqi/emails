OK, but then there is no excuse to silently ignore any kind of error in User=. If systemd can not start unit as a specified user, it must fail it, just like ExecStart: if the command specified there is not found, it doesn't start a random shell or a web server, right?.  I thought the current behavior of ignoring some syntax "mistakes" was put in place by design because units have to be backwards copatible with older systemd versions.
