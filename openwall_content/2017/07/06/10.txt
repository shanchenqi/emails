It is entirely possible that systemd units as distributed by upstream projects might assume features of systemd (>= some version), just like upstream projects might assume features of glibc (>= some version) or coreutils (>= some version) or bash (>= some version). systemd does not magically cause dependency relationships to go away.  Some upstreams are very conservative in what dependencies they will accept, while others are quick to add dependencies on new things if they see an advantage. That doesn't mean the conservative projects have no dependencies at all.  > The problem is that my new and shiny > script won't work as intended on old systemD versions which silently ignore > User= directive.  I am not aware of any such version existing. The commit "first attempt at proper service/socket logic", which was 6 months before the release of systemd version 1 and was the first commit to introduce ExecStart, also introduced User.
