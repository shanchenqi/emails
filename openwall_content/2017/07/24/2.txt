There was a research if this flaw could be triggered remotely, by sending packets on the air, the result follows:  RX notification is regarding event send to a userspace program, which is usually the "wpa_supplicant" or "hostapd". The userspace can register in kernel via to pass management frames to it. This flaw would be remote exploitable if a userspace program registers to receive some management frames and then pass it back to a kernel without a modification. I'm not sure if any user space program do that, I think "hostapd" or "wpa_supplicant" don't, but to be sure, it will require to fully analyze theirs source code. (Stanislaw Gruszka <sgruszka@...hat.com>)  So, this flaw is unlikely to be triggered remotely, as certain userspace code is needed for this. An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to induce kernel memory corruption on the system, leading to a crash. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although we believe it is unlikely.
