One way to do it could be through doing occasional security reviews of upstream software that is also of relevance to other distros, and sharing the findings (or even mere concerns and questions) in here (or actually via the (linux-)distros list, if the findings are bad enough and there's an expectation that a fix would be developed soon enough for a few days of embargo to make a difference).  Arguably, the expertise that the above requires is not absolutely necessary for pure downstream distros that could nevertheless benefit their users through preparing security updates sooner (if accepted onto the distros list).  Another way to get somewhat involved is what Sona demonstrated through participation in and starting on-topic discussions (beyond the membership requests), e.g.:   Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
