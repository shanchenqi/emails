Right.  This basically tells us there's interest, and from whom and for what reasons.  That's useful, so thanks for posting your request.  However, in practice the list membership has been frozen since the last distro addition in April so for almost 3 years now.  Since then, there were only removals and changes in who's subscribed for the previously accepted distros.  Perhaps we'll be forced to re-open this can of worms, or shut down these lists for good.  Simply keeping them frozen is unfair to new distros requesting membership now.  Simply accepting all who request membership based on mostly objective criteria yet without introducing distro's userbase size as a criterion is, in my opinion, going to make things worse overall (in terms of balance of benefit to users vs. risk of leaks).  Yet we might, as long as the benefit-risk is still deemed to be positive (even if less than now).  Just to be fair.  Here's a thread from with some half-baked thoughts on the issues:   Here are some recent requests:   What's common about the timing of these: they were triggered by vulnerabilities that attracted a lot of media attention.  This may be primarily about publicity and checklists ("our competitors are on that list, we should be too") and only secondarily about security.  I do value the persistence of some distros/people reminding me about their requests, though - suggesting their interest is more likely genuine. And your request isn't nearly that "badly" timed. ;-)  > Probably you will need some proof that I'm who I claim to be.

I notice you fixed OpenSSL promptly:   However, that issue wasn't on the distros list.  I also notice you've been on oss-security for half a year.  That's good. However, I wasn't able to find any record of your past participation in this specific community.  You might want to get more involved first.  And if/when we do re-open the list for additional distros, you'll be able to re-request membership.
