The announcement is at [1] but it is often better to look at [2] to work out what is what, though their announcement for is one of the more better ones.  Remote code execution (RCE) in PHPMailer â No specific issue appears to affect WordPress or any of the major plugins we investigated but, out of an abundance of caution, we updated PHPMailer in this release. This issue was reported to PHPMailer by Dawid Golunski and Paul Buonopane. (this is an extra  fix for the and I'll leave it to you to decide if it is same ID or new)  The REST API exposed user data for all users who had authored a post of a public post type. WordPress limits this to only post types which have specified that they should be shown within the REST API. Reported by Krogsgard and Chris Jean.  Cross-site scripting (XSS) via the plugin name or version header on update-core.php. Reported by Dominik Schilling of the WordPress Security Team.  Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) bypass via uploading a Flash file. Reported by Abdullah Hussam.  Cross-site scripting (XSS) via theme name fallback. Reported by Mehmet Ince.  Post via email checks mail.example.com if default settings arenât changed. Reported by John Blackbourn of the WordPress Security Team.  A cross-site request forgery (CSRF) was discovered in the accessibility mode of widget editing. Reported by Ronnie Skansing.  Weak cryptographic security for multisite activation key. Reported by Jack.   - Craig  1: 2: https://wpvulndb.com/wordpresses/47   --  Craig Small (@smallsees)   http://dropbear.xyz/     csmall at : enc.com.au Debian GNU/Linux           http://www.debian.org/   csmall at : debian.org GPG fingerprint:        5D2F  F96B DF50 FEA5   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
