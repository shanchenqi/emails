Normal applications are supposed to be designed to use the Qt containers with,  in the extreme, a couple hundred thousand items. If you're using them with  upwards of a billion elements, you should redesign.  If you're dealing with untrusted data, then you're supposed to sanity check it  before passing to any container. That's true for even the Standard Library  containers: you don't ask it to allocate 6 GB just because you got that size  from the network or some file, because it may succeed and that would still be a  DoS due to high swap usage.  As for QXmlSimpleReader and for the whole QtXml module, it is in Done state.  We're not working on it. We will fix security issues, though, so we need to  analyse the details that you've supplied.  --  Thiago Macieira - thiago (AT) macieira.info - thiago (AT) kde.org    Software Architect - Intel Open Source Technology Center   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
