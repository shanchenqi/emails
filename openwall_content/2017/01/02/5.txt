This could allow the issuance of certificates with fraudulent subject naming information (allowing the holder of the private key to impersonate another entity), or inappropriate key usage or extended key usage information (use of certificate for unauthorised purposes e.g. code signing).  Upstream patch :  Note: on older freeipa versions (4.3 & 4.2), path to affected file differs  Impact: moderate CVSS3 scoring : 6.3 - AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L Reported by: Liam Campbell (Red Hat) Affected versions: all versions supporting certificate profiles are affected: 4.2 and above.   2) : DoS attack against kerberized services by abusing password policy  FreeIPA contains MIT KDC as its main component + FreeIPA is using custom database driver for the KDC. As a side-effect of implementation, FreeIPA is enforcing password policies for all principals, including services which do not use "password" but keytab with randomly-generated/strong key.  Default password policy locks an account after 5 unsuccessful authentication attempts for 10 minutes. An attacker can use this to simply lock-out any principal, including system services.  Upstream patch :  Additional dependency :  Impact: moderate CVSS3 scoring : 7.5 - AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H Affected versions: all  Reported by: Petr Spacek (Red Hat)  Best Regards,   --  Cedric Buissart, Product Security   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
