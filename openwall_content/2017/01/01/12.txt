Yes, we know that sometimes command line tools with issues like READ of size 1  cannot create damage. However, for completeness and for people/packagers that want to have them  fixed in they repository, I shared the details as well.  > > AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow ...

Since libtiff ships some  binaries, I take time to test each binary. So, there was a situation where a  bug filed against an issue reproducible via tiffcp was fixed from a commit  which addressed an issue filed against tiffcrop. But as you have pointed out, there were cases where a commit addressed a READ  issue and later on it was discovered that it fixed a WRITE issue too.   > If there is additional information from bisection, please let us know.  The commit that addresses the specific issue seems to be  However the process seems to fails to exit and went into a loop, but that's a  different issue and needs to be reported upstream.  --  Agostino Sarubbo Gentoo Linux Developer  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
