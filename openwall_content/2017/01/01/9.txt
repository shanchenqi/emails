A crafted tiff file revealed a NULL pointer access.  The complete ASan output:  # tiffinfo -Dijr $FILE  TIFFReadDirectoryCheckOrder: Warning, Invalid TIFF directory; tags are not  sorted in ascending order. TIFFReadDirectory: Warning, Unknown field with tag encountered. TIFFReadDirectory: Warning, Unknown field with tag encountered. TIFFReadDirectory: Warning, Unknown field with tag 2 (0x2) encountered. TIFFFetchNormalTag: Warning, ASCII value for tag "DocumentName" contains null  byte in value; value incorrectly truncated during reading due to  implementation limitations. TIFFFetchNormalTag: Warning, Incorrect count for "JpegProc"; tag ignored. TIFFReadDirectory: Warning, Photometric tag value assumed incorrect, assuming  data is YCbCr instead of RGB. TIFFReadDirectory: Warning, SamplesPerPixel tag is missing, applying correct  SamplesPerPixel value of 3. _TIFFVSetField: Warning, SamplesPerPixel tag value is changing, but  SMinSampleValue tag was read with a different value. Cancelling it.
