I discovered several crashes in libtiff. To avoid dozens of posts, I tried to  group them based on the type of issue. Summary:  1) The majority of the issues were reproducible by upstream and they were  fixed 2) Few issues were reproducible by upstream and they were NOT fixed 3) Some issues were NOT reproducible by upstream.  So for now I will not post the issues described at the point NÂ°3 and try in  the near future to make upstream able to reproduce them.  Will follow the details.  --  Agostino Sarubbo Gentoo Linux Developer  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
