The ikiwiki maintainers discovered two related flaws in the passwordauth plugin's use of CGI::FormBuilder, involving API design issues similar to those that led to Impact:  * An attacker who can log in to a site with a password can log in   as a different and potentially more privileged user. * An attacker who can create a new account can set arbitrary fields   in the user database for that account.

For current releases, this is fixed in ikiwiki >= For the Debian 8 branch, it is fixed in ikiwiki  Regards,     S  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
