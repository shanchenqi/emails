Hanno has blogged about this at [1] and linked it to the other issue which we credited him for (but it is in fact a separate issue).  Thanks,  [1] https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/55-Fuzzing-Irssi-with-Perl-Scripts.html   On Thu, at Ailin Nemui wrote: > Dear oss-security List, >  > Please provide some CVEs for the following issues. >  > Thanks, >  >  > Multiple vulnerabilities in Irssi [1] > ===================================== >  >  > Description > ----------- >  > Four vulnerabilities have been located in Irssi. >  > (a) A NULL pointer dereference in the nickcmp function found by Joseph >     Bisch. >  > (b) Use after free when receiving invalid nick message (Issue >  > (c) Out of bounds read in certain incomplete control codes found by >     Joseph Bisch. >  > (d) Out of bounds read in certain incomplete character sequences found >     by Hanno Bรถck and independently by J.
