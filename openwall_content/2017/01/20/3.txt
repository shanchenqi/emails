Note that glibc is not affected by either of these issues.  Originally reported by Florian Weimer.   # Weak SUID check allowing privilege elevation  Hesiod unsafely checks EUID vs UID in a few places, consulting environment variables for configuration if they match.  This could be used for privilege elevation under some circumstances.  The fix uses secure_getenv() in place of getenv().  https://github.com/achernya/hesiod/pull/9   # Use of hard-coded DNS domain if configuration file cannot be read  If opening the configuration file fails, hesiod falls back on a default domain ".athena.mit.edu" to retrieve managed information.  A local attacker with the opportunity to poison DNS cache could potentially elevate their privileges to root by causing fopen() to fail.  https://github.com/achernya/hesiod/pull/10   Thanks,  --  Doran Moppert Red Hat Product Security  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
