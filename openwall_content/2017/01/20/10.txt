Good questions, I had not looked at it from a mainline timeline perspective.  1) Mainline kernels containing patches [a], [b] and [c] are not vulnerable.  2) The vulnerability is *NOT* due to non-upstream patches that went into RHEL 5 and/or 6.  3) I suspect some older LTS mainline kernels that branched off mainline/upstream at around the same time as RHEL 6 would be vulnerable. Check if the data structure fields, corresponding to the initialization changes in patch [a], [b] and [c], are initialized the same way in the LTS mainline kernels you maintain.  4) For any RHEL 5 vintage LTS mainline kernels, see if task_struct's thread_group field is not initialised. If so, it is likely partially vulnerable and could do with a strong dose of patch [c].
