The bug itself resides in of the src tree, in function kbase_dispatch which is the main ioctl dispatcher of the driver:  static mali_error kbase_dispatch(struct kbase_context *kctx, void * const args, u32 args_size) { ...     /* setup complete, perform normal operation */      switch (id) { ... 	case KBASE_FUNC_TMU_SKIP: 		{ /* MALI_SEC_INTEGRATION */ #ifdef CONFIG_SENSORS_SEC_THERMISTOR #ifdef CONFIG_USE_VSYNC_SKIP 			struct kbase_uk_tmu_skip *tskip = args; 			int thermistor = sec_therm_get_ap_temperature(); 			u32 i, t_index = tskip->num_ratiometer;  			for (i = 0; i < tskip->num_ratiometer; i++) <== missing of boundary check 				if (thermistor >= tskip->temperature[i]) 					t_index = i;  tskip->temperature is a uint32 array of static size(10 elements) and tskip->num_ratiometer a uint32 which is user controlled. Since the boundary check is missing, OOB read may happen leading to possible memory corruption.  -----Original Message----- From: Greg KH [mailto:greg@...ah.com]  Sent: Thursday, January 19, PM To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Cc: Anarcheuz Fritz <anarcheuz@...il.com>; cve-assign@...re.org Subject: Re: [oss-security] CVE Request - Samsung Exynos GPU driver OOB read  On Thu, Jan 19, at Idler wrote: > Hello, >  > I'd like to request CVE for the following security issue: >  > Security bulletin:  > >  > out of bound read in gpu driver >  > Severity: Low > Affected versions: M(6.0), N(7.0) devices with Exynos AP chipsets  > Reported on: May 31, Disclosure status: Privately disclosed. > Vulnerability in gpu driver does not properly check the boundary of  > buffers leading to a possible memory corruption. > The applied patch avoids an illegal access to memory by checking the boundary. >  > Source code: > Source code of the affected GPU drivers (as part of the Linux kernel > source) can be downloaded from Samsung Opensource Resource center: > http://opensource.samsung.com/ >  > The particular model of phone we used to reproduce this issue is: > http://opensource.samsung.com/reception/receptionSub.do?method=sub&sub >  Any pointer to the commit(s) that happened to resolve this issue?  thanks,  greg k-h   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
