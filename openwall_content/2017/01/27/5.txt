We only submitted the test case in it was smaller and harmless. We sent the other file privately to the security teams of some Linux distributions. Both aborts/crashes have a very similar backtraces so we think they are the same issue. We are using ASAN to test so we are quite sure that there is no previous unsafe memory use before the ones reported here. Nevertheless, ASAN is not perfect and we are not the developers of libical so cannot be sure.  > >> > If it's a different file, then I'd like to have access to the file but I >> > would prefer if it was just available publicly and not to me only. >> >> Feel free to make the file public if you want. > > You would have to send it to me first :-)  Ups, i sent it to a different Raphael (also from Debian).
