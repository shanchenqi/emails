Quoting from the advisory there seem to be three issues fixed (full quoting for the list archives):  WordPress is now available. This is a security release for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.  WordPress versions and earlier are affected by three security issues:   1/ The user interface for assigning taxonomy terms in Press This is shown to users who do not have permissions to use it. Reported by David Herrera of Alley Interactive.   2/ WP_Query is vulnerable to a SQL injection (SQLi) when passing unsafe data. WordPress core is not directly vulnerable to this issue, but weâve added hardening to prevent plugins and themes from accidentally causing a vulnerability. Reported by Mo Jangda (batmoo).   3/ A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the posts list table. Reported by Ian Dunn of the WordPress Security Team.   Could you please assign CVEs for those issues?
