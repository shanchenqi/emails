The year portion of a CVE ID does not necessarily correspond to a vulnerability discovery date. To obtain a ID, at least one of the following must be true:    - the original CVE ID request occurred during  or    - the original CVE ID request mentioned a specific vulnerability     reference URL that was a publicly accessible URL before the end of     (although a Reproducer URL is very useful, we do not consider     it a vulnerability reference URL)  These criteria were not met, and therefore a ID was assigned, and remains the correct ID.  For the other numbers associated with similar timelines, the number remains valid. We do not change them to numbers.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =pEew -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
