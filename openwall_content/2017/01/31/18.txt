Due to incorrect use of strtoll function and integer sizes (chunk_size in it was possible to pass negative chunk_size in chunk encoding, so after computing final size using FFMIN function later on it would be passed as argument to avio_read function. This results a heap-overflow which we found out to be exploitable, because overflowed buffer is allocated right next to the AVIOContext structure[3]. Overflowing function pointer in this structure immediately results rip control and then code execution. >  > * [1] - > * [2] - > * [3] - >  > This issue was fixed in   > --[ 2 - libavformat/rtmppkt.c ] >  > Issue is connected with buffer overflow on the heap in RTMP protocol. After a bit of reverse engineering of RTMP protocol you can notice that it uses chunk (of max bytes) to _transfer_ data, but chunks of more size could be used to _store_ the data. Because size of packet is not check that it is the same as it was in the same transmission you can first send packet with smaller size and then bigger size, and this results heap-overflow[1]. If you can align chunks right you can achieve white-what-where condition and that results and RCE. >  > * [1] - >  > The issue was fixed in   > --[ 3 - ffserver.c ] >  > This issue is completely like the first one and it results heap overflow. >  > This issue was fixed in   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
