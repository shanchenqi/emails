It could occur  loading values into SS register in long mode.  A user/process inside guest could use this flaw to crash the guest resulting  in DoS or potentially escalate their privileges inside guest.  Upstream patch: ---------------    ->  Reference: ----------    ->  Note: On Intel CPUs it'd corrupt the guest state resulting in DoS; Whereas on        AMD CPUs it could potentially escalate privileges inside guest.  This issue was discovered by Xiaohan Zhang of Huawei Inc.  was assigned to this issue by Red Hat Inc.
