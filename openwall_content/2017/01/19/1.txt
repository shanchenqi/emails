Thus the below description of is inconsistent - the vulnerability addressed by is which is excluded from the CVE's coverage by the third list item.  > Use for the vulnerability addressed by "Fix XXE in XML > parsing" in >  > The scope of this CVE does not include the various other issues that > may be found in the above references: >  >  - it does not include any aspect of >    >  >  - it does not include any vulnerabilities in the XML Security Library >    (xmlsec), such as ones that are now, or previously were, listed at >    >  >  - it does not include any (Entity Expansion) issues that may >    have been fixed as a side effect of >    (possibly there are new >    test cases in for  This can be seen also by noticing that the patch substitues "defusedxml.ElementTree" for "xml.etree.ElementTree" (and its native code equivalent cElementTree), and consulting the table and note #1 at:  https://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.html#xml-vulnerabilities  which points out that "etree" is vulnerable to but not to  The vulnerability in libxml2 is still exposed in pysaml2, via its use of lxml and xmlsec.  The exposure via lxml may be mitigable by disabling entity resolution altogether (resolve_entities=False), but xmlsec seems to lack any such switch.  --  Doran Moppert Red Hat Product Security  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
