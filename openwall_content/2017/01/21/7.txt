Quoting from Eric Anholt's post:  "" We copy the unvalidated ioctl arguments from the user into kernel temporary memory to run the validation from, to avoid a race where the user updates the unvalidate contents in between validating them and copying them into the validated BO.  However, in setting up the layout of the kernel side, we failed to check one of the additions (the roundup() for shader_rec_offset) against integer overflow, allowing a nearly MAX_UINT value of bin_cl_size to cause us to under-allocate the temporary space that we then copy_from_user into.
