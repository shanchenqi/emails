[...] fix affects the certificate check callback. It provides a valid parameter to indicate whether the native cryptographic library considered the certificate to be correct. This parameter is always 1/true before this fix leading to a possible MITM.  This does not affect you if you do not use the custom certificate callback or if you do not take this value into account. This does affect you if you use pygit2 or git2go regardless of whether you specify a certificate check callback.    Could CVEs please be assigned?
