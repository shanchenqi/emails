Ftr, this was upstreamed as   It turns out that this is not enough, so upstream has issued   to make the checks more stringent. Quoting a reply from upstream to the Debian maintainer "But as I see it there are still combinations of the arguments which make the test succeed even though the the memory block identified by offset&size is not fully inside memory&total_size ??? e.g. offset < memory, but size is larger than the difference.  I have attached another patch (applies on top of yours) that more stringently checks all the memory bounds. Hopefully that will preempt shenanigans with specially crafted files containing weird offsets and sizes."  Could you please assign a further CVE for this follow up fix?  Furthermore I would like to ask if the following two commits from upstream, can have as well an identifier assigned:   They relate to the Red Hat bugzilla entry at   All the three followup commits are included in Debian with the recent upload to Debian unstable, versioned as  Regards, Salvatore  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
