A software defect omits setting the BN_FLG_CONSTTIME flag for nonces, failing to take a secure code path in the BN_mod_inverse method and therefore resulting in a cache-timing attack vulnerability. A malicious user with local access can recover ECDSA private keys.  Mitigation: Users of OpenSSL with the affected versions should apply the patch available in the manuscript at [1].  Users of LibreSSL should apply the official patch from OpenBSD [2,3].  Users of BoringSSL should upgrade to a more recent version.
