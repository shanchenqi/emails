If you use the CredentialProvider feature to encrypt passwords used in   NodeManager configs, it may be possible for any Container launched by   that NodeManager to gain access to the encryption password. The other   passwords themselves are not directly exposed.  Mitigation: 2.7.x users should upgrade to 2.6.x users should upgrade to If you cannot upgrade to the latest version, set the permission of the   jceks file appropriately to restrict access from unauthorized users.
