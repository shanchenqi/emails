The problem is that the "Open" functionality of ark would run shell scripts,  this is quite unexpected.  The title for the advisory we're preparing is   Ark: unintended execution of scripts and executable files  The fix is already available at https://cgit.kde.org/ark.git/commit/?  Thanks,   Albert  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
