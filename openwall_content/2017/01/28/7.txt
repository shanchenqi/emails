(It is not exclusively a CVE about directories for cron.) As mentioned in the description, "it's not clear to me whether Portage should provide a solution to that, or the ebuilds authors should make sure to always depends, in case of touching cronbase directories, on the cronbase package, to ensure that it's installed prior to installing them." In other words, it is conceivable that this could be considered a documentation problem, if the final decision is that each ebuild author needs to be responsible for letting the "correct" entity determine the appropriate permissions.  - --  CVE Assignment Team M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at   http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =mgyN -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
