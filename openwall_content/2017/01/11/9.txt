ACS such as SELinux (not sure about AppArmor) will keep container processes from accessing external file descriptors. Of course, you can prevent these kind of attacks completely (modulo kernel bugs) by never running privileged containers or giving them CAP_SYS_PTRACE in the first place.  Great work on the flaw and patch. An extremely interesting vulnerability.  _Trevor  --  Sent from my Casio Loopy.
