If it is, it's possible that downstream projects could apply a similar patch in client code while remaining compatible with current (unpatched) libxml2.  Even if this gets into libxml2, client code will need to enable a new option explicitly to prevent XXE.  There's an argument to make NOXXE default behaviour, but this could potentially impact a lot of projects that silently rely on some form of external entity resolution.   >  - it does not include any vulnerabilities in the XML Security Library >    (xmlsec), such as ones that are now, or previously were, listed at >     xmlsec is exposed to but considers this a bug in libxml2 and at present has no plans to provide a workaround.  I expect a CVE assignment for xmlsec will only be needed if it is fixed/worked around in that project.   --  Doran Moppert Red Hat Product Security  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
