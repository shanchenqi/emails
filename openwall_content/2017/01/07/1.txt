Turns out CVEs were indeed already issued for these disclosures.  I was pointed to and so was told to get CVEs quickly.  -- seems like the reporter also requested his own CVEs under different groupings and now we have duplication disclosures/cves with classification conflicts.  Not sure what to do about the duplicates but you can ignore this request.
