This in turn meant that the same Processor could be used for concurrent requests. Sharing a Processor can result in information leakage between requests including, not not limited to, session ID and the response body. The bug was first noticed in 8.5.x onwards where it appears the refactoring of the Connector code for 8.5.x onwards made it more likely that the bug was observed. Initially it was thought that the 8.5.x refactoring introduced the bug but further investigation has shown that the bug is present in all currently supported Tomcat versions.  Mitigation: Users of the NIO HTTP connector with the affected versions should apply one of the following mitigations - Switch to the BIO HTTP, NIO2 HTTP or APR HTTP connector - Disable send file - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat or later   (Apache Tomcat has the fix but was not released) - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat or later - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat or later when released - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat or later when released - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat or later when released  Credit: This issue was reported publicly as Bug [1] and the security implications identified by the Tomcat security team.
