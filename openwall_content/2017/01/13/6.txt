I'm one of the maintainers of Turris OS - OpenWRT fork used on Turris and Turris Omnia routers[1].  Not sure what has to be part of application, on wiki[2] I found only that I should request it here.  Probably you will need some proof that I'm who I claim to be. You can see bunch of commits on our gitlab[3] (signed by the same key I'm using to sign this mail) and you can reach me and some of my colleagues on security@...ris.cz e-mail alias that is also listed as security contact on our web[4].  We have infrastructure in place to work on embargoed issues without disclosing them to public. Not sure whether there are any other requirements to meet. If so, please let me know.
