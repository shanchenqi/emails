If I have:  /var/log/nginx/error.log -> /etc/ld.so.preload  Why does logrotate "create www-data adm" over /var/log/nginx/error.log removes and creates /etc/ld.so.preload ??? That is shocking!  It should do that on /var/log/nginx/error.log, by removing that symlink and creating a new empty standard file on /var/log/nginx/error.log !!  Dont you agree??
