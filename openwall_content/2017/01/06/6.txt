I noticed that firejail allows ptrace with --allow-debuggers, which allows a sandboxed program to escape the seccomp profile by rewriting permitted system calls into unpermitted ones pre-Linux-4.8. This is documented in the seccomp manpage:   > Before kernel 4.8, the seccomp check will not be run again > after the tracer is notified.  (This means that, on older > kernels, seccomp-based sandboxes must not allow use of > ptrace(2)—even of other sandboxed processes—without extreme > care; ptracers can use this mechanism to escape from the > seccomp sandbox.)  (I wrote a little program demonstrating this behavior last year at ).  I emailed the author and they commited a fix (within 45 minutes!):  Should this have a CVE id as well?  Best,  Lizzie.
