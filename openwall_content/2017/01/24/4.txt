Date:   Fri Jan 29      basic: fix touch() creating files with mode          mode_t is unsigned, so MODE_INVALID < 0 can never be true.          This fixes a possible DoS where any user could fill /run by writing to     a world-writable /run/systemd/show-status.  The analysis says that is a "possible DoS", but its a local root exploit indeed. Mode also contains the suid bit, so files created by touch() are world writable suids, root owned. Such as /var/lib/systemd/timers/stamp-fstrim.timer thats found on a non-nosuid mount.  This is trivially exploited by something like:   with minimal changes, so I wont provide a PoC here.  The bug was possibly introduced via:  commit Author: ... Date:   Wed Nov 11      util-lib: use MODE_INVALID as invalid value for mode_t everywhere   So we believe that this mostly affects of systemd, but its recommended that distributors cross-check their systemd versions for vulnerable touch_*() functions. We requested a CVE for this issue from MITRE by ourselfs:  We would like to see that systemd upstream retrieves CVE's themself for their own bugs, even if its believed that its just a local DoS. This would make distributors life much easier when we read the git logs to spot potential issues. The systemd git log is really huge, with lots of commits each week ("new services as a service").
