(dot dot) in an extracted filename.  Issue: https://github.com/halostatue/minitar/issues/16  Upstream patch:  The same issue exists in rubygem archive-tar-minitar  I believe they're based on the same codebase, and minitar is the officially supported fork, so I'm not sure if this warrants two CVEs or just one.
