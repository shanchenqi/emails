The "_raw()" function of the  ImageMagick "im" backend passes the "$index" parameter unsanitized to the  shell. This parameter is f.e. exposed by the getImageAtIndex($index) function.  No core horde application exposes the $index parameter directly to the net, so a "remote" code execution might be given for third party  applications only. Read: The risk is low for normal horde users.  Affected versions are to A fixed version has been released.  Upstream fix:  Official release announcement: ----------------------------------- Hello,  a Remote Code Execution vulnerability has been found in the   Horde_Image library when using the "Im" backend that utilizes   ImageMagick's "convert" utility. It's not exploitable through any   Horde application, because the code path to the vulnerability is not   used by any Horde code. Custom applications using the Horde_Image   library might be affected though. This vulnerability affects all   versions of Horde_Image from to  A fixed version of the Horde_Image (version library has already   been released and everybody is advised to upgrade to Horde_Image   as soon as possible.  Thanks to long-time contributor and supporter Thomas Jarosch   <thomas.jarosch@...ra2net.com> for discovering and reporting these   vulnerabilities.  -- Jan Schneider The Horde Project https://www.horde.org/ -----------------------------------   Timeline: Found the issue during manual code review             after the recent issue.  Sent patch to security@...de.org  Checked horde code base if any horde core             application exposes the vulnerable API.  Wrote to security@...de.org again             that the security risk for core horde apps is low,             no embargo via linux-distros@ needed.  Fix is committed to git.  Release of fixed version by the Horde project.   Thanks to Jan Schneider of the Horde project for the timely release of the fixed version.
