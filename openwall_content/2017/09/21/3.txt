That's against oss-security list content guidelines:  http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security#list-content-guidelines  "When applicable, the message Subject must include the name and version(s) of affected software, and vulnerability type.  For example, a Subject saying only is not appropriate, whereas Acme Placeholder 1.0 buffer overflow" would be OK."  As a moderator, I took the liberty of correcting the Subject to my best guess of what it should have been, before approving the message.  This guess is based purely on message content as follows.  I didn't analyze the issue in its proper context.

And oops, looks like I misread this as "hi" being too high, whereas it was actually "lo" that was too high.  So I thought the check on line was wrongly a signed check (or else a "hi" that is too high wouldn't pass it).  But actually the bug is probably the lack of check of "lo".  So if anyone needs a description for tracking this issue, for now it should be bark_noise_hybridmp() out of bounds access".  I guess the lessons here are:  1. People posting to oss-security should adhere to the list guidelines.  2. People should prioritize vulnerability analysis over obtaining CVE IDs. If can't analyze (no skills, desire, time), include some more general description like "crash" or "out of bounds access" - it wouldn't be very specific, but would show the (very limited) extent of analysis up to that point and would (hopefully) be correct.  3. As a moderator willing to put very little time per message, maybe I shouldn't try to over-do my job, and if I do correct obviously unsuitable message Subjects (like this message originally had), then do so only in the minimal manner suggested above.
