Can you clarify the affected versions? I noticed while looking at the above, that MITRE description mentions "Qemu through I perfectly realize those does not come from the above.  As far as I can see, e.g. cpu_physical_memory_snapshot_get_dirty was only introduced in The upstream commit associated with the above issue is:    which fixes    introducing the use of dirty bitmap snapshots in vga_draw_graphic().  Do I miss something makeing it affecting as well earlier versions than  Regards and thanks already for your help, Salvatore  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
