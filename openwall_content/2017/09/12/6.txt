ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  When removing or replacing a grant mapping, the x86 PV specific path needs to make sure page table entries remain in sync with other accounting done.  Although the identity of the page frame was validated correctly, neither the presence of the mapping nor page writability were taken into account.  IMPACT ======  A malicious or buggy x86 PV guest could escalate its privileges or crash the hypervisor.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen versions are affected.  Only x86 PV guests can leverage the vulnerability.  x86 HVM guests as well as ARM guests cannot leverage the vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only HVM guests will avoid this vulnerability.  However, the vulnerability is exposed to PV stub qemu serving as the device model for HVM guests.  Our default assumption is that an HVM guest has compromised its PV stub qemu.  By extension, it is likely that the vulnerability is exposed to HVM guests which are served by a PV stub qemu.  For PV guests, the vulnerability can be avoided if the guest kernel is controlled by the host rather than guest administrator, provided that further steps are taken to prevent the guest administrator from loading code into the kernel (e.g. by disabling loadable modules etc) or from using other mechanisms which allow them to run code at kernel privilege.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Andrew Cooper of Citrix.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            xen-unstable       Xen 4.9.x       Xen 4.8.x, Xen 4.7.x       Xen 4.6.x       Xen 4.5.x  $       $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
