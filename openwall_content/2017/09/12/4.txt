ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The function `__gnttab_cache_flush` handles GNTTABOP_cache_flush grant table operations. It checks to see if the calling domain is the owner of the page that is to be operated on. If it is not, the owner's grant table is checked to see if a grant mapping to the calling domain exists for the page in question.  However, the function does not check to see if the owning domain actually has a grant table or not. Some special domains, such as `DOMID_XEN`, `DOMID_IO` and `DOMID_COW` are created without grant tables. Hence, if __gnttab_cache_flush operates on a page owned by these special domains, it will attempt to dereference a null pointer in the domain struct.   IMPACT ======  The guest can get Xen to dereference a NULL pointer.  For ARM guests and x86 PV guests on systems with SMAP enabled, this will cause a host crash (denial-of-service).  For x86 PV guests on systems without SMAP enabled, an attacker can map a crafted grant structure at virtual address 0.  This can be leveraged to increment an arbitrary virtual address, which can then probably be leveraged into a full privilege escalation.   VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All versions of Xen since Xen 4.5 are vulnerable.  x86 HVM guests do not expose the vulnerability.  ARM guests and x86 PV guests on systems with SMAP enabled are only vulnerable to a Denial-of-Service (host crash).  x86 PV guests on systems without SMAP running are vulnerable to a privilege escalation.  MITIGATION ==========  Hardware supporting Supervisor Mode Access Prevention (Intel Broadwell, AMD Zen) can mitigate the privilege escalation to a DoS.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Matthew Daley.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.            xen-unstable, 4.9, 4.8, 4.7, 4.6, 4.5  $   $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
