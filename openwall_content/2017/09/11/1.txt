When Emacs renders MIME text/enriched data (Internet RFC it  is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution. Since Emacs-based mail clients decode  "Content-Type: text/enriched", this code is exploitable remotely. This bug  affects GNU Emacs versions through  Although we know no efforts to exploit this in the wild, exploitation is easy.  == Details ==   == Patch ==   == Mitigation ==  To work around the bug in unfixed versions of Emacs, put the following code in  your personal or site-wide Emacs init file (~/.emacs, ~/emacs.d/init.el,  site-start.el):     ;; Mitigate (security) in Emacs and earlier.    (eval-after-load "enriched"      '(defun enriched-decode-display-prop (start end &optional param)         (list start end)))  and avoid 'emacs -Q' and similar options that bypass normal initialization.  == Timeline ==  Bug reported to the Emacs bug tracker by Charles A. Roelli.  POC for remote code execution sent to the maintainers of Emacs and  Gnus (Reiner Steib <Reiner.Steib@....de>, private mail).  Patch (by Lars Ingebrigtsen <larsi@...s.org>) to disable the  problematic code and mitigation (private mail).  Patch committed in main development repository.
