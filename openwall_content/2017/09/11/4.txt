For SysV, if you don't need readiness-notification (for daemons that other daemons don't depend on, so the ones where Type=simple would be acceptable in a systemd unit) then Debian's start-stop-daemon can provide the daemonization, and create a pid file if desired. This isn't proper supervision, but does give the ability to write the daemon as though it relied on being supervised.  start-stop-daemon is shipped as part of dpkg for historical reasons, but I doubt it changes very often. If SysV init script writers wanted to spin it off into a separate upstream project, then it could perhaps eventually become non-Essential in Debian (since it isn't necessary if a machine boots with systemd and all the daemons on that machine have native systemd units), and that seems like a potential win for everyone?  (Also, one of the most vocally SysV-based distributions is a Debian derivative, so they have start-stop-daemon anyway.)
