Ok, well for one thing just because we can't have perfect coverage doesn't mean we should simply give up. Also CVE's aren't "hearsay", they are claims based, with evidence being needed (the stronger the claim, the more likely you are to get a CVE), especially in the open source world where I typically require a link to either the vuln code, or the code patch in order to give a CVE to something (if you can't tell me what code is vuln, in open source, then chances are you need to understand the vuln more before we CVE it up, exceptions of course can be made, e.g. when someone has a reproducer that works reliably).  This is also why I've been pushing for a JSON format so we have better meta data in CVE, for things like affected projects/product so people can much more easily monitor what they do care about. It's not done yet but we are making progress.   > > If someone (e.g. with identity 'bugmeister@...d.cn') informs me (an > upsteam maintainer) that some particular bug has been assigned a particular > CVE then how can I know that to be a fact?   You can check the CVE Database? There is the official MITRE one: cve.mitre.org and the DWF for Open Source (and yes, I lag in submissions to MITRE) at https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/DWF-CVE-Database/ in both cases the CVEs will have reference link(s) that ideally point to the upstream making it easy to match up.   > > > Bob > -- > Bob Friesenhahn > bfriesen@...ple.dallas.tx.us, http://www.simplesystems.org/users/bfriesen/ > GraphicsMagick Maintainer,    http://www.GraphicsMagick.org/ >    --   Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
