I did not mean that the CVE itself is "hearsay".  What I meant is the  way an upstream maintainer is informed about a CVE is often no better  than "hearsay".  In some cases the information comes from someone who  is already known and trusted while in other cases it is impossible to  even tell who is providing the information since the person providing  the information has intentionally obfusticated their identity.  If an upstream maintainer reports that a release resolves a particular  CVE, then he could easily have provided wrong information given that  the upstream maintainer does not have access to the technical details  of the report and analysis which initiated the CVE and may confuse one  issue with another.  It may be that the upstream maintainer fixes a problem and some weeks  later the CVE is created related to the problem which was fixed.  > You can check the CVE Database?

The database entries do not contain enough information for an upstream  maintainer to identify one issue from another similar issue.  They  only contain sanitized information.
