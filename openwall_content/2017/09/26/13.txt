I understand the issue well, I talk to companies all the time about this :)  The rule for the kernel is, "if a distro/company/user is not following the stable kernel updates, they are on their own".  I recommend either using the stable kernels, or paying for a company that knows what they are doing in this area and provides support (Red Hat, SuSE, etc.)  And if you try to argue "just tell us what needs to be fixed", well, we are, am, we are providing about patches a day that people should be incorporating into their kernels.  Why they ignore that curated and tested stream of fixes is beyond me...  Anyway, this is getting a bit off-topic here, sorry for the noise.
