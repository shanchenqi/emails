Severity: Important  Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation  Versions Affected: Apache Mesos to The unsupported Apache Mesos 1.0.x as well as 0.x versions may be also affected.  Description: When handling a libprocess message wrapped in an HTTP request, libprocess crashes if the request path is empty, because the parser assumes the request path always starts with '/'. A malicious actor can therefore cause a denial of service of Mesos masters rendering the Mesos-controlled cluster inoperable.  Mitigation: pre-1.1.x users should upgrade to at least 1.1.x users should upgrade to 1.2.x users should upgrade to users should upgrade to users should obtain Mesos  Credit: This issue was discovered by Lyon Yang and Jeremy Heng  Alex on behalf of Mesos PMC   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
