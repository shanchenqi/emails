To quote the web site: 'Open Source software security discussions " http://www.openwall.com/lists/ the fact that it has turned into a security announce list with limited discussion is  just how things go I guess. Also it's tough because the Linux Kernel has explicitly said they won't get CVE's for all their security issues, they simply fix and move on, their culture is "run something current, if not, to bad" (which part of me agrees with, but that doesn't work so well for IoT/enterprise/people needing a high degree of stability/assurance).   > > 2.

Step 1 here for the open source community would be making sure Kernel issues get CVEs, and then that those CVEs get into the CVE database so people are aware of them.   > > I appreciate everyoneâs time and effort on all this stuff.
