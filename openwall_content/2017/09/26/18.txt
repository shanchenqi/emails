It is incredibly difficult for most non-commercial upstreams to do  this since they have limited manpower, they are not informed of all  the applicable CVEs, and the CVE information received is essentially  hearsay, received from unknown/unverifiable sources.  I am thinking  that it is best for most non-commercial upstreams to not mention CVEs  at all.  If someone (e.g. with identity 'bugmeister@...d.cn') informs me (an  upsteam maintainer) that some particular bug has been assigned a  particular CVE then how can I know that to be a fact?
