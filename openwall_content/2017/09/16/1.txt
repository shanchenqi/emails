Versions 0.3 through 2.9 are vulnerable to remote code execution. An  attacker can craft an RSS item where the name of media enclosure (the podcast file) contains shell code. When user plays the file in  Podbeuter, the shell code will be executed.  A commit fixing the vulnerability in Git:   A patch for Podbeuter 2.9:   Upstream issue:  I've requested a CVE from MITRE on August 27th, but haven't heard back  yet, so decided to disclose without a number.  --  Regards, Alexander Batischev  PGP key Fingerprint: CE6C FD94  A00F 0C8B FD03   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
