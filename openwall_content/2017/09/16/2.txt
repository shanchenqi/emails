Thanks.  Going forward, please report relevant issues in here right away, without waiting on MITRE.  We previously had these guidelines in a footnote, but I've just upgraded them to their own section here:  http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security#cve-requests  "Previously, one could request CVE IDs for issues in Open Source software from oss-security.  This is no longer the case.  Instead, please start by posting about the (to be made) public issue to oss-security (without a CVE ID), request a CVE ID from MITRE directly, and finally "reply" to your own posting when you also have the CVE ID to add.  With the described approach you would only approach MITRE after the issue is already public, but if you choose to do things differently and contact MITRE about an issue that is not yet public, then please do not disclose to them more than the absolute minimum needed for them to assign a CVE ID."  with links to:  https://cveform.mitre.org  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
