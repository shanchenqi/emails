According to David Miller it's too much code complexity for little gain.  An easy security fix for old kernels is therefore to prevent UFO from becoming enabled. This is done by masking the UFO feature inside net/core/dev.c:netdev_fix_features(), which gets called during register_netdevice() and also when someone tries to re-enable UFO f.e. with ethtool later on.  I'm sharing my "one line" patch here in case it's useful to someone else stuck on old kernel versions, f.e. Android phones. Also please correct me if I'm wrong on this fix.
