While I understand you not wanting to post to a public mailing list right away, why exactly would you have wanted a longer embargo than e.g. linux-distros' maximum of 14 days?  > So we decided to disclose our findings to the secure mailing list that > unfortunatelly only have a maximum of 7 days embargo periods.  You're probably referring to the Linux kernel security list.  7 days sounds like a reasonable embargo period to me, but if you really wanted more, you could get up to 14 by first contacting linux-distros only, and then bringing the issue to the Linux kernel security list in no more than 7 days to the planned public disclosure.  > I am happy to hear the red hat security team allows for longer embargo > periods, and we will contact you directly in the future.  I hope you will only go for a longer embargo when there's actually a good reason for that.  There might or might not have been in this case.
