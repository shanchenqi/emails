I wouldn't recommend putting effort into fuzzing mp3gain. mpglibDBL is known to have security vulnerabilities anyway: https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/mp3gain (I wonder whether you've rediscovered those, or found new vulnerabilities?)  It probably also suffers from most other historical vulnerabilities that are listed for We removed it from Debian in with a recommendation to use the rgain Python package instead: https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/rgain  rgain uses libmad or ffmpeg via GStreamer for decoding, so it isn't exactly bug-free either; but those libraries are actively maintained, and when they have vulnerabilities, they'd need to be fixed anyway for the benefit of other packages.
