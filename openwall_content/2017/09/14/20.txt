On August 15th we have contacted one of the senior maintiners of BlueZ and attempted to establish a longer embargo period with him. Unfortunatelly his suggestion was to post our findings to linux-bluetooth@...r.kernel.org, which is a public mailing list.  So we decided to disclose our findings to the secure mailing list that unfortunatelly only have a maximum of 7 days embargo periods.  I am happy to hear the red hat security team allows for longer embargo periods, and we will contact you directly in the future.   Thank you,  Armis Labs.   > >   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
