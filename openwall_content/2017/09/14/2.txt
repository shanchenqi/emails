The fuzz was done via the aacgain command-line tool which uses mp3gain which bundles an old-modified version of called mpglibDBL. The upstream project seems to be dead, so the issue wasnât communicated to them.  The complete ASan output of the issue:  # aacgain -f $FILE ASAN:DEADLYSIGNAL                                                                                                                                                                                                  =================================================================                                                                                                                                                  AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address (pc bp sp T0)     #0 0x8aafdf in sync_buffer     #1 in decodeMP3     #2 in main     #3 in __libc_start_main     #4 in _start  AddressSanitizer can not provide additional info.
