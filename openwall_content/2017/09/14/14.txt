Targeting updates for on or about September 12, for coordinated disclosure."  May you please share with us who was contacted on August 15th and 17th and why you waited until September 5th with the disclosure to linux-distros and security@...nel.org?  If it was because of the strict embargo rules for linux-distros and security@...nel.org mailing lists, next time please feel free to reach Red Hat directly via secalert@...hat.com . We will honour any reporter set embargo and can contact other vendors directly. And also work on the fixes.
