I disagree. I am considering cleaning up mp3gain and omitting nearly all of the vulnerabilities by removing the decoder fork. Reason: rgain does not do what mp3gain did. Mp3gain can directly modify the MPEG frames so that the gain is changed also for decoders that do not support the added metadata (it additionally stores metadata to be able to revert the changes).  While I am not regularily using this myself, I do think that it's a nifty hack that should not disappear. Maybe it can re-enter distros if it does not rely on an outdated internal decoder …   This is becoming a bit off-topic … but I just wanted to note that the bug reports do serve a purpose in alerting me to that other copy of code in the wild.
