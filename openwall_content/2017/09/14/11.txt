But this time with a twist: This again seems to be a lifted version of the modified code from Lame! A forked fork.  I'll have a look if I can rip that mpglib out of mp3gain and provide a patch that uses an up-to-date for parsing instead. This would perhaps be a better path forward for distros than to remove the vulnerable mp3gain altogether.  An impressive list of vulnerabilities you have there … perhaps some specific to mp3gain's modifications, but I guess the overflows in layer3.c are well-known already from and Lame.
