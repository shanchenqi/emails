Under a non-asan build the crash does not occur, so there is no CVE, but you may want to have it fixed in your repository.   Description: mp3gain is a program to analyze and adjust MP3 files to same volume.  The fuzz was done via the aacgain command-line tool which uses mp3gain which bundles an old-modified version of called mpglibDBL. The upstream project seems to be dead, so the issue wasnât communicated to them.
