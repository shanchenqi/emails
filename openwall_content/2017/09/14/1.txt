The fuzz was done via the aacgain command-line tool which uses mp3gain. The upstream project seems to be dead, so the issue wasnât communicated to them.  The complete ASan output of the issue:  # aacgain -f $FILE AddressSanitizer: stack-buffer-overflow on address at pc bp sp READ of size 8 at thread T0     #0 in filterYule     #1 in AnalyzeSamples     #2 in main     #3 in __libc_start_main     #4 in _start  Address is located in stack of thread T0 at offset in frame     #0 in main    This frame has 7 object(s):     [32, 33) 'maxgain'     [96, 97) 'mingain'     'nprocsamp'     'maxsample'     'lsamples' 00 00 00 f2 f2 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 Shadow byte legend (one shadow byte represents 8 application bytes):   Addressable:           00   Partially addressable: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07    Heap left redzone:       fa   Heap right redzone:      fb   Freed heap region:       fd   Stack left redzone:      f1   Stack mid redzone:       f2   Stack right redzone:     f3   Stack partial redzone:   f4   Stack after return:      f5   Stack use after scope:   f8   Global redzone:          f9   Global init order:       f6   Poisoned by user:        f7   Container overflow:      fc   Array cookie:            ac   Intra object redzone:    bb   ASan internal:           fe   Left alloca redzone:     ca   Right alloca redzone:    cb  Affected version:  Fixed version: N/A  Commit fix: N/A  Credit: This bug was discovered by Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo.
