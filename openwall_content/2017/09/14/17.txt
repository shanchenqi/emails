This includes individual commits in the public git repository with reference to particular CVE IDs and credits to the original reporter(s) and the author of each bugfix.  Thank you, Denis.  I was hoping you'd post more like a full advisory, and include the credits and maybe the disclosure timeline.  I should have been more specific.  Here's my reconstruction of the timeline:  Unknown date(s) - issues found  Unknown date(s) - issues reported to upstream  September 3 - tcpdump release prepared, but not supposed to be made public yet  Unknown date(s) - private disclosure (by upstream?) to some distros (not via the distros list) with CRD set to September 25 (since a 3 week embargo was mentioned elsewhere, this could have been on September 4)  September 4 - "The tar.gz turned up in the public release directory on 4 September by an accident"  September 5 - "and was deleted on 5 September"  September 5 - at least Mageia and Fedora update their tcpdump packages, apparently due to these projects' automated monitoring for new upstream releases (IIRC, as confirmed by links to automatically-created bug tracking entries and such)  September 6 - upstream sends private message to some distros about the leak, moving the CRD to September 13  September 6 - first notification to the distros list by NixOS, who are not on the list and who thought the information was already known to list members, saying in part "We don't think that the embargo can be sustained under these conditions, even for another week."  September 6-8 - several people and distros try and fail to convince upstream to go public with the full detail ASAP, but nevertheless receive explicit permission to go ahead with releasing updated packages  September 7 - an Arch Linux developer (who is not on (linux-)distros and apparently was not aware of the distros list discussion) brings the issue to oss-security (it's unclear to me how that person knew of the September 25 initial CRD); I approve that message right away  September 8 - upstream posts a clarification to oss-security, confirming that distros are right to proceed with releasing updates; the tarball is placed on the tcpdump.org website  September 13 - full detail is made public (I think this means individual commits rather than only the tree as a whole)  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
