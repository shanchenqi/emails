[VulnerabilityType Other] Divide By Zero  [Reference] https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/syzkaller/e4SrsEBEziQ   [Discoverer] Andrey Konovalov  <andreyknvl@...gle.com>  It was fixed in linux mainline  commit Author: Wei Wang <weiwan@...gle.com> Date:   Thu May 18      tcp: initialize rcv_mss to TCP_MIN_MSS instead of 0          When tcp_disconnect() is called, inet_csk_delack_init() sets     icsk->icsk_ack.rcv_mss to 0.     This could potentially cause tcp_recvmsg() => tcp_cleanup_rbuf() =>     __tcp_select_window() call path to have division by 0 issue.     So this patch initializes rcv_mss to TCP_MIN_MSS instead of 0.
