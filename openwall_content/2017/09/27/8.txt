Is oss-security's coverage of security issues in open-source software intended to be comprehensive?  As others have said, no.  (I think that would be an unrealistic goal. It could also result in so much traffic we'd have to think of splitting the list e.g. into notifications vs. discussions, but arguably that would be a good problem to have.)  However, I would like the coverage to increase.  When e.g. Debian sends out a security advisory, they shouldn't literally post it in here. We had asked (in list content guidelines) for distro-specific advisories not to be sent in here, for good reasons.  However, if Debian and any other distros doing similar have the resources, I'd appreciate it if they bring in here info on vulnerabilities in Open Source software that they're tracking / are about to patch / have already patched / have even issued advisories on, but that haven't been mentioned in here before.  Many distros (and/or people from distros' security teams) have been doing just that from time to time, but certainly not consistently.  Maybe my encouragement above will help improve this?
