For that second issue, I've not ever really run into any "known security fix" not being cc:ed to stable.  Do you have any known examples where I can go poke the maintainers to do better?  We have plenty of the normal "bugfix was merged that a few years later turned out to be a 'security' issue, but no one realized it at the time" changes that get merged.  And to help combat that, we are doing more and more "smart mining"[1] of the kernel commits to try to catch patches that match those types of fixes and get them merged into the stable kernels.  You can see the initial results of this work with the huge increase in patches being merged to the 4.9 and 4.4 stable kernels vs. any older stable kernel trees in the past.  thanks,  greg k-h  [1] yes, we know people have been doing this for years, but they almost     never notify upstream about this for various reasons.
