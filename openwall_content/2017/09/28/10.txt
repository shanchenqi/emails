Critical vulnerabilities in these libraries have widespread consequences to the internet community.  Bounty Qualification:  - Only Critical vulnerabilities that demonstrate unambiguous remote code   execution are eligible under this program. Findings with alternative impact   or severity are not in scope at this time.  - Your Proof of Concept MUST demonstrate that remote exploitation can be   easily, actively, and reliably achieved.  - Only versions currently supported by the upstream project are eligible.   Please verify your issue is present in a current release before submission.  - The individual library maintainers have final decision on which issues   constitute security vulnerabilities. The Panel will respect their decision,   and we ask that you do as well. It's important to keep in mind that not all   submissions will qualify for a bounty, and that the decision to award a   bounty is entirely at the discretion of the Panel.  In scope projects currently:  https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick https://github.com/glennrp/libpng http://hg.code.sf.net/p/graphicsmagick/code/ https://github.com/curl/curl https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/tcpdump  I hope to motivate people with this email. I understand that oss-security mailing list is not meant to announce these in regular basis, but I consider this hackerone project highly relevant for the researchers reading this list.  Also if you have spare time please help projects like Google's oss-fuzz https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz to get us more safer internet for everyone.  --  Henri Salo  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
