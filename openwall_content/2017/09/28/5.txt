Yes, fair enough, you are right.  Those cases do exist, this one fell through the cracks, which will always happen, we are all human, even Al :)  > I don't know if you should "go poke" Al Viro "to do better".

Maybe this was already in place for that one occasion?  I don't have access to my email archives at the moment, but I _think_ this one was my fault as it was on my list of things "go look at", and I never go to it in time.  My current list of patches that fall into that category is rather large, due to my recent travels, hopefully I'll catch up on that by the end of this month.  I always suggest that if I do miss things, please let me know through whatever way you want to (public list, security@k.o, private email, poking me on irc, taking me out to drinks, etc.)  thanks,  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
