I know that for Red Hat the pre-disclosure was useful.  During analysis, like SUSE, we rated it as having a security impact of Moderate (https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification); and not highly impacting that required expedited preparation of packages for the embargo date. Additional information is contained within the bugzilla linked off our CVE page  We look forward to working with you again in the future.
