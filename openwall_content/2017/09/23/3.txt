The final build/release/publication process was invoked just minutes after the public disclosure and the final artifact was signed and hit the repository just 20 minutes after the disclosure. The advisories were sent ~4 hours later once gone through a peer-reviewing process (yes this could have been done even faster).  But that's not actually the primary goal of your mail, so lets focus on answering the more important questions below from my personal point of view.  > All of this makes me wonder if the distros list serves its purpose. >  > I'd be curious to hear: >  > a) if any people felt that pre-disclosure of optionsbleed was helpful > to them and in which way (after all - even if it only helps minor > distros and major distros ignore it it may still be a good thing). >  > b) if people think that they'd usually prepare a fixed package, however > they didn't consider optionsbleed important enough.

Anyway, my personal believe is that the list is important, useful and in fact definitively helps preparing coordinated releases and doing all needed work before a final fixed package can be deployed for security relevant fixes. Most of the time the provided information (at least for me :P) helps to analyze and understand the underlying problem and its impact beforehand. If patches are available (like for optionbleed) those can be tested and possibly slightly adjusted or discussed when not fitting a specific version/branch. All this is part of the whole process before a problem is analyzed/understood, prioritized, build-requirements adjusted, artifacts prepared and finally released so being able to do the first steps in a coordinated way definitively helps.  However, I indeed see your point and understand the frustration and the reason for your mail demonstrated via the optionbleed case. I neither say nor believe that every entity did perfectly to provide the users with fixed packages as that's obviously not the case. What I try to point out is that the list is IMO far from being useless and indeed serves its purpose. I think blaming or questioning the list itself is the wrong conclusion. Instead every entity on its own should rethink their process, prioritization and possibly lack of resources (I include myself to do this). This is not meant to anyone as blaming but we all share the goal to protect the users as good as possible and I believe that the distros list aids in doing so.  cheers, Levente  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
