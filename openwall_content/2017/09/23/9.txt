Also I haven't found any info about updated   We have released openSUSE Leap and SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 SP2/SP3 updates.  Where did you look and not find this?  SUSE has rated the issue as moderate severity (bordering on important), as exploitability seems difficult and not targetable.  So we were not targeting a "same as CRD day release" as with other more severe issues, but have now released updates in the next days after the CRD.  In general predisclosure is useful for us, same as for the others for  evaluation and preparation of critical security issues.
