The Debian bug tracker (bugs.debian.org) is always public and has no mechanism for embargoing individual bugs, so it is never used before public disclosure.  It's entirely possible that your conclusion is correct in this case (I don't have any more information than you do on whether the Debian security team or package maintainer made use of the embargo period for this vulnerability), but the late opening of a bug is not evidence that no work was done before public disclosure.  is an example of a vulnerability for which the package maintainer (me) was definitely aware before the bug was filed.
