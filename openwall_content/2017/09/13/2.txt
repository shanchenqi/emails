This request can be issued by a user with CAP_NET_ADMIN privilege and may result in NULL dereference and a system crash.  References:    Suggested upstream patch:   Vulnerability surface:  Further analysis showed that request should be issued for a WiFi interface connected to a wireless network. This mean that an attacker should be root already or should be root in a user+net namespace to which a WiFi interface was moved from a main net namespace. We believe the later configuration to be very unlikely.
