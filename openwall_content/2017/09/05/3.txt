The issue lets an attacker overwrite a fixed 20 bytes stack buffer with a specially crafted .notes section in an ELF binary file.  There are systems like amavisd-new that automatically run file(1) on every email attachment. To prevent an automated exploit by email, another layer of protection like -fstack-protector is needed.  Upstream fix:  The issue was introduced with this code change in October  has been released including the fix:  [An official release announcement on the file mailinglist will follow once a temporary outage of the mailinglist is solved]   The cppcheck tool helped to discover the issue: ---- (warning) Logical disjunction always evaluates to true: descsz >= 4 || descsz <= 20. ----   Credits: The issue has been found by Thomas Jarosch of Intra2net AG. Code fix and new release provided by Christos Zoulas.   Fixed packages from distributions should start to be available soon.   Timeline (key entries): Notified the maintainer Christos Zoulas Christos pushed a fix to CVS / git             with innocent looking commit message  Notified Redhat security team to coordinate release             and request CVE ID. Redhat responds it's better to directly             contact the distros list instead through them.  Notified distros mailinglist, asking for CVE ID             and requesting embargo until ID is assigned  After discussion that the issue is semi-public already,             moved embargo date to Public release   Best regards, Thomas Jarosch / Intra2net AG  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
