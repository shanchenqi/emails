I was under impression that having a CVE ID speeds up processes in  distros, and fixes are released quicker. That's why for my previous (and  first ever) vulnerability I first got an ID and only then released the  details and the patch. The assignment took just a day.  Was my impression wrong? I just want to do things "right", so that  attackers have as little time as possible to exploit users. (I do  realize this all is best-effort and distros might still take time to  release, and then users might take ages to upgrade.)  Now that I had an experience of waiting for three weeks, I'll also  re-consider if I want to become a CNA for my project. Previously it  seemed like a hassle; I'm not so sure now.  --  Regards, Alexander Batischev  PGP key Fingerprint: CE6C FD94  A00F 0C8B FD03   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
