OpenStack Releases Ocata, Newton.  ### Discussion ###  Keystone uses for password hashing. This provides insufficient and limited protection, since algorithm has a low computational cost factor, therefore making it easier to crack passwords offline in a short period of time.  The correct mechanism is to use the more secure hashing algorithms with a higher computational cost factor such as bcrypt, scrypt, or instead of  ### Recommended Actions ###  It is recommended that operators upgrade to the Pike release where all future passwords would be bcrypt hashed.  Operators should also force password changes on all users [1], which will result in the users newly generated passwords being bcrypt hashed.  ### Contacts / References ### Author: Luke Hinds <lhinds@...hat.com> [1]: https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/latest/admin/identity-security-compliance.html#force-users-to-change-password-upon-first-use [2] This OSSN : Original LaunchPad Bug : Mailing List : [Security] tag on openstack-dev@...ts.openstack.org OpenStack Security Project : https://launchpad.net/~openstack-ossg     Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
