If those orgs have such poor, limited, or maybe cost-saving processes (saving on not needing to bother with issues lacking CVE IDs, no matter how serious), it's their problem and their users'.  They deliberately put themselves at a competitive disadvantage. So be it.  This only reaffirms me in my suggested approach: public disclosure first, CVE next.  So those big corps will have a reason to fix the issues anyway, just with their self-imposed delay.
