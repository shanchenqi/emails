These metadata operations could leak information about application data types.  In addition, an attacker could perform a denial of service attack on the cluster.  Mitigation: Users of the affected versions should upgrade to Apache Geode or later.  Credit: This issue was reported responsibly to the Apache Geode Security Team by Dan Smith from Pivotal.
