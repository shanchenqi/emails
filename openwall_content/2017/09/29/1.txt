The main reason we have extra stipulations on this particular program is that some of the projects that have signed up were worried about being inundated with low-severity issues that didn't actually do much to improve security. So, we started with a fairly high bar to emphasize the main goal of looking for critical vulnerabilities (i.e., RCE). However, ASLR is not full-proof and only delays the inevitable, so I agree that vulnerabilities that are solely mitigated by ASLR should still be in-scope for a bounty.  Separately, we're happy to announce that libav ( https://git.libav.org/?p=libav.git;a=summary) was added to the scope earlier today.  If other well-known projects fit into the category of "data processing" and wish to participate, please reach out to panel [@] internetbugbounty.org, and we'd be happy to add you.
