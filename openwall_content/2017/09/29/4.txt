If run against a non-asan build clamscan will still segfault in my tests. Found with afl.  The bug happens in the function xar_hash_check. Despite it being reported more than a year ago there's still no release with the fix (however it's been fixed in git).  I fuzzed clamav according to the instructions in this blog post:  Upstream fix:  Upstream bug (not public):  Timeline: reported bug fix in git public disclosure due to lack of upstream action  base64-encoded poc (didn't want to send it as an attachment due to fear of crashing people's mail scanners. On the other hand I'm sure there are mail scanners that'll try to decode the base64...):   Meta-level comment: It seems to me clamav development has mostly stalled. Detection rates are very low and I'm considering to stop using it for mail filtering. (also there's of course the whole AV debate, however I never saw clamav as a security tool, more as something like a spam filter that prevents crap in my inbox. Still of course it needs to have secure parsers.)
