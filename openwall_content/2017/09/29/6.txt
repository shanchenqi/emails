WHERE id = $id";     $tmpquery2 = "DELETE FROM ".$tableCollab["posts"]." WHERE topic = $id";     $pieces = explode(",",$id);     $num = count($pieces);     connectSql("$tmpquery1");     connectSql("$tmpquery2"); ```   ## Proof of Concept 2  The following HTTP request allows an attacker to extract data using SQL injections in the `id` parameter (it requires at least one saved bookmark):  ``` ```  ### Vulnerable code  The vulnerable code is found in `bookmarks/deletebookmarks.php`, line 32.  ``` if ($action == "delete") { 	$id = str_replace("**",",",$id); 	$tmpquery1 = "DELETE FROM ".$tableCollab["bookmarks"]." WHERE id IN($id)"; 	connectSql("$tmpquery1"); ```   ## Proof of Concept 3  The following HTTP request allows an attacker to extract some information using SQL injection in the `id` parameter (it requires at least one calendar entry):  ``` ```  ### Vulnerable code  The vulnerable code is found in `calendar/deletecalendar.php`, line 31.  ``` if ($action == "delete") { 	$id = str_replace("**",",",$id); 	$tmpquery1 = "DELETE FROM ".$tableCollab["calendar"]." WHERE id IN($id)"; 	connectSql("$tmpquery1"); ```  **Notes** The application probably needs a security posture against injections, so other parameters and pages may be vulnerables. This advisory does not intend to be an exhaustive list of vulnerable parameters.   ## Solution  Update to the latest version avalaible.  ## Affected versions  * Version <=  ## Timeline (dd/mm/yyyy)  * : Initial discovery. * : Initial contact. * : GPG Key exchange. * : Advisory sent to vendor. * : First fixes. * : Fixes validation by Sysdream. * : PhpCollab ask to wait before publish. * : New version has been released. * : Public disclosure.  ## Credits  * Nicolas SERRA, Sysdream  (n.serra -at- sysdream -dot- com)  --  SYSDREAM Labs <labs@...dream.com>  GPG : C43E 2A2E 8EB4 8CD9 D5B2  * Website: https://sysdream.com/ * Twitter: @sysdream    Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
