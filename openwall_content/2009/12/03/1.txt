Hi Steve,  The two CVE names were assigned when this issue was reported in  vendor-sec (forwarded you the email; I should have cc'ed you but I  missed it, sorry). When it was reported, the reporter combined two  patches into one, but the upstream committed them in two separate  patches: upstream commits and  There are two issues in commit The first issue (problem) was  assigned and the second issue (problem) was assigned  Commit should be associated with  because the fix is also for an issue that was introduced by  (which is related to the first issue).  Commits and (first problem) = Commit (second problem) =  Thanks, Eugene --  Eugene Teo / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
