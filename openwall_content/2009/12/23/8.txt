There are three options for how to handle this:  - create separate CVEs, one for QEMU and one for virtio net - create one CVE, concentrating on QEMU, with virtio net as an example - create one CVE, concentrating on virtio new, mentioning the impact on    QEMU  In the discussion in I don't see  any clear resolution about whether it's a security problem that qemu exits  in situations other than an ACPI shutdown.  I don't know qemu/kvm so I  can't be sure; if qemu can support multiple hosts at the same time, and a  crash in one host triggers a qemu crash/exit that affects all the hosts,  then I would call this an issue in qemu.  If there's an attack angle to  prevent forensics analysis, then that might be a reasonable argument, too.  If virtio net (whatever that is) exhibits this behavior in "normal" non-VM  situations, then it should get a CVE itself.  But if it's closely tied to  qemu, or to VMs in general, then I'm less certain.  VMs can stretch our older notions about threat models, and I suspect  that's why this is difficult to handle.  - Steve   > We decided to fix it as a security update in qemu since a remote > attacker could DoS an Ubuntu LTS guest, possibly leading to data > corruption within the guest. and later kernels should not be > affected. > > Jamie > > --  > Jamie Strandboge             | http://www.canonical.com >  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
