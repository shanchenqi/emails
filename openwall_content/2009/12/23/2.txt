This can lead to security problems, e.g. if there's a cron script giving a  user full rwX rights for a directory, he can put a symlink there pointing to /  or /etc or whatever. Another scenario would be a backup script saving the /home acls to a file,  every user can create an endless loop for that and prevent the script from  completing.   Fixed in upstream source, but no new release yet. Please assign a CVE.  --  Hanno Bรถck		Blog:		http://www.hboeck.de/ GPG:  http://schokokeks.org - professional webhosting  Download attachment "signature.asc " of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
