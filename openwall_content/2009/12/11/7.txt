The fix applied by upstream in both cases is incomplete as it only prevents the command execution vulnerability, but doesn't address the argument injection vulnerability.  The appropriate fix in both cases is to use escapeshellarg instead of escapeshellcmd.  Please assign new ids for the incomplete fixes.  Thanks in advance.
