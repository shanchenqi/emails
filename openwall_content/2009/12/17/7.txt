That's the normal behavior of the PHP team. As far as I know, they are  not willing to announce security-related fixes unless the issues are quite  important. The vulnerabilities are silently fixed.  > What does the others think?  I think, we should contact PHP developers about security related issues  from the release of the last php version e.g) up to now. We can  miss some issues that have already been fixed. It would be better to get  an issue list from vendor. I hope they will be responsive.
