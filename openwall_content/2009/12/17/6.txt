It was recently fixed in but not considered security-relevant by upstream * explode() information leak * serialize() information leak  As mentioned by the presentation all these are local vulnerabilities.   Additionally, I've started to closely follow upstream development and found the following issues that were or have not been mentioned anywhere else:  Null pointer dereference:  This one looks suspicious, basically a switch from sprintf to snprintf which apparently already happened in the other branches at some point:  Improper decoding, not sure what the impact could be:  Insufficient memory allocation for unicode strings:  I think a cross-vendor security support and tracking effort for php5 is needed. The number of issues silently fixed are a continuous risk, leaving users exposed. What does the others think?
