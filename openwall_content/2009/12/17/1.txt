Advisory text does not really map well to > the list of patches.  I think part of the underlying problem is that we're talking about blended  threats (in the case of Ark and KMail).  I took an agressive view regarding  the issues as I originally discussed them when I dealt with them but for many  reasons we reached a stale mate.  We ended up releasing things as they were  to get them into the domain where they could better be discussed and  discussed.  Retrospectively, I would go with CVEs for the the following:  * Ark Uses KHTML For Rendering Unknown File Types * KMail Allows Attachment Spoofing * Javascript Enabled On KHTML Based Views By Default * KJS/KIO Slaves Enforcing Broken Same Origin Policy  Note that KDE's fix for the latter has caused some complaints, something that  I suspect they were mindful of when we discussed the issues:    *  On top of this we have a raft of IO slave related vulnerabilities (which KDE,  oCERT and Portcullis agreed about) .  I'm not sure what the status of each of  these is, as Thomas alluded to they were fixed at various times (I'm not even  sure they're all fixed now).  I would create another CVE for these.  Finally, there is the issue with KWallet which KDE never addressed.  The  closest I got to an answer regarding this was that users complained too much  even now about the matching, so adding additional restrictions were  unwelcome.
