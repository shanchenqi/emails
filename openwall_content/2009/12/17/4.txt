The "Fixed a initialization order remark by Serg" fix,  problem pointed out in your comment dated as "[14 Jul Sergei Golubchik".  As when you use full path for --datadir, it's correctly expanded using realpath.  Relative paths starting with '.' are expected to be resolved from CWD.  I've not checked path starting with '~', they may be affected by this problem too.
