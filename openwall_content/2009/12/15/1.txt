Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: kernel: firewire: ohci: handle receive packets with  a data length of zero  Anyone who can open any of the /dev/fw* files on recent version of the  new firewire stack can trigger a NULL pointer dereference with ohci 1.0  controllers (or ohci 1.1 controllers that are being used in ohci 1.0  mode because of hardware bugs) by issuing certain ioctls.  On machines with non-blacklisted ohci1.1 controllers, the call does  nothing, which is a bug.
