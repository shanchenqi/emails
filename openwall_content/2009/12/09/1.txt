Due to an oversight, this was not brought to the attention of oss-security before now.  This issue is public and fixed upstream, and affects guests using a kernel (or backported virtio net drivers from the kernel, like our LTS release does). Specifically, if a guest with the affected virtio net drivers is running under qemu/kvm, then if you saturate a network connection to the guest, the guest will crash. This is  There was not consensus on whether this should get a CVE. You can see the patch and upstream discussion here:  The bug is really two parts though: the qemu issue which crashes the guest, and the guest kernel writing garbage to the virtio net backend. We decided to fix it as a security update in qemu since a remote attacker could DoS an Ubuntu LTS guest, possibly leading to data corruption within the guest. and later kernels should not be affected.
