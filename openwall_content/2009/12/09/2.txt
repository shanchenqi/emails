Stefan Esser found a vulnerability in Piwik, which can allow arbitrary files  to be written into writable locations on the webserver. He says, it is also  possible to execute arbitrary PHP code directly in newer versions of Piwik.  The original advisory is here:  unserialize-vulnerability/  I think, it is worth assigning a CVE.
