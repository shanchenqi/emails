Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: kernel: hfs buffer overflow  "A specially-crafted Hierarchical File System (HFS) filesystem could  cause a buffer overflow to occur in a process's kernel stack during a  memcpy() call within the hfs_bnode_read() function (at  fs/hfs/bnode.c:24).  The attacker can provide the source buffer and  length, and the destination buffer is a local variable of a fixed  length.  This local variable (passed as "&entry" from  and allocated on line 60) is stored in the stack frame of  hfs_bnode_read()'s caller, which is hfs_readdir(). Because the  hfs_readdir() function executes upon any attempt to read a directory on  the filesystem, it gets called whenever a user attempts to inspect any  filesystem contents."
