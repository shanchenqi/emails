Folks, may be I am wrong in my assertions?  It is correct to say that installations of current releases of Apache  httpd - versions <= and <= - which are built using the  bundled copy of APR-util, may be affected by the three APR-util issues,  depending on the configuration and set of modules used.  Note that  Apache httpd 2.x can also be built using standalone installations of APR  and APR-util.  We're not aware of any way to trigger remotely using the  set of modules included in httpd itself.  It may be possible to trigger  both and if mod_dav is configured.
