Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE request: kernel: sparc64: Fix crash with /proc/iomem  This was introduced in commit and fixed in commit The description is as follows:  From: Mikulas Patocka <mpatocka@...hat.com>  [ Upstream commit ]  When you compile kernel on Sparc64 with heap memory checking and type "cat /proc/iomem", you get a crash, because pointers in struct resource are uninitialized.  Most code fills struct resource with zeros, so I assume that it is responsibility of the caller of request_resource to initialized it, not the responsibility of request_resource functuion.  After is out, there could be a check for uninitialized fields added to request_resource to avoid crashes like this.
