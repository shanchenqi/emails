Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE request: "billion laughs" attack against Apache APR  Hi, could a CVE name be allocated for this issue:  The expat XML parser is vulnerable to the "billion laughs" entity  expansion attack.  This results in a denial of service vulnerability in  any network-facing service which uses the Apache "APR-util" library's  wrapper interface for expat to parse untrusted XML documents.  The  Apache httpd WebDAV module "mod_dav" is such a service.
