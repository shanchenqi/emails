Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE Request: kernel: kvm: failure to validate cr3 after KVM_SET_SREGS  "This applies to kvm-84 and earlier (and possibly to the in-kernel kvm version too) on all x86 machines in all guest modes (32-bit, PAE, 64-bit).  Userspace callers of KVM_SET_SREGS can pass a bogus value of cr3 to the kernel. This will trigger a NULL pointer access in gfn_to_rmap() when userspace next tries to call KVM_RUN on the affected VCPU and kvm  attempts to activate the new non-existent page table root.  This happens since kvm only validates that cr3 points to a valid guest physical memory page when code *inside* the guest sets cr3. However, kvm currently trusts the userspace caller (e.g. QEMU) on the host machine to always supply a valid page table root, rather than properly validating  it along with the rest of the reloaded guest state."
