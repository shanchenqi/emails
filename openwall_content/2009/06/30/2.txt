Kaminskiy" <yumkam@...il.com> Subject: CVE assignment notification -- Pidgin: DoS (OOM,  crash) via specially-crafted ICQWebMessage  Hello Steve, vendors,    has been assigned to the following Pidgin DoS issue:  Pidgin background: ------------------  Pidgin is an instant messaging program which can log in to multiple accounts on multiple instant messaging networks simultaneously. Open System for CommunicAtion in Realtime (OSCAR) is AOL's flagship instant messaging and presence information protocol, used for AOL's two main instant messaging systems: ICQ and AIM.  Flaw description: ----------------- An out-of-memory denial of service flaw was found in the Pidgin's  OSCAR protocol implementation. If a remote ICQ user sent a web message to the local Pidgin user using this protocol, it would lead to excessive memory allocation and denial of service (Pidgin crash).   Affected Pidgin versions: <= Pidgin <= ------------------------  (It's possible, the AIM IM system OSCAR protocol                            implementation in Pidgin-1.5.* is also affected,                            but according to Yuriy: "AFAIK, older pidgin/gaim                            won't work current icq servers.")
