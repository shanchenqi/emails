At least both have the vulnerable code and I had verified the "billion laughs" attack against Apache with Subversion mod_dav_svn that uses internal Apache libaprutil.  OS for testing was FreeBSD, but I think that others are affected as well.  CC'ing Apache security contacts in case they aren't informed about this issue yet.
