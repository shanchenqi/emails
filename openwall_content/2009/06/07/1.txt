I don't know if this lock is needed there. It has always been there in 2.6 and never in 2.4. Either it's a long-time missed patch or just not needed here. I won't touch it as I have no way to test it and nobody complains ;-)  Regards, Willy   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
