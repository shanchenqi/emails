The IKEv2 fuzzer used was developed by the Orange Labs vulnerability research team. The tool was initially written by Gabriel Campana and is now maintained by Laurent Butti.  All strongSwan versions from up to are affected. Either apply the two security patches  http://download.strongswan.org/patches/03_invalid_ike_state_patch/  http://download.strongswan.org/patches/04_swapped_ts_check_patch/  or upgrade to strongSwan or [...]  --  Bye,      Thomas --   Thomas Biege <thomas@...e.de>, SUSE LINUX, Security Support & Auditing  SUSE LINUX Products GmbH, GF: Markus Rex, HRB (AG Nuernberg) --             Hamming's Motto:            The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers.                                 -- Richard W.
