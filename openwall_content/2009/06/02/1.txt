There are 2 more issues that cause DTLS server to crash (NULL pointer dereference DoS), detailed in upstream bug reports linked below.   DTLS: SegFault if ChangeCipherSpec is received before ClientHello   This was first fixed upstream in   DTLS fragment bug - out-of-sequence message handling   Here NULL pointer dereference resulting in DTLS server crash can happen in dtls1_retrieve_buffered_fragment() during memcpy from frag->fragment.  This is fixed in not yet in the latest available at the moment -   Both issues should be reproducible by connecting using s_client to s_server.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
