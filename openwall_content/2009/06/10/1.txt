Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: kernel: fix crash when large packets are received  "Michael Tokarev reported receiving a large packet could crash a machine  with NIC. Problem is this driver tells that NIC frames up to  bytes can be received but provides skb to rx ring allocated with  smaller sizes bytes in case standard bytes MTU is used). When  a frame larger than what was allocated by driver is received, dma  transfer can occurs past the end of buffer and corrupt kernel memory.  Fix is to tell to NIC what is the maximum size a frame can be. This bug  is very old, (before git introduction,  I have informed Willy (2.4 maintainer) about this.
