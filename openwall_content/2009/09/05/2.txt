I'm not sure what this means for CVE.  Should there be another CVE id for the issues fixed in 2.6 in (if one was not allocated at the time), and 2.4 could reference both CVE ids now?  I did not check if any of the affected code is possibly normally only available to root, but even if so the issue may be relevant on systems with containers.
