From the USN   Russell Senior discovered that the system authentication module selection  mechanism for PAM did not safely handle an empty selection. If an  administrator had specifically removed the default list of modules or  failed to chose a module when operating debconf in a very unlikely  non-default configuration, PAM would allow any authentication attempt,  which could lead to remote attackers gaining access to a system with  arbitrary privileges. This did not affect default Ubuntu installations.  Also tracked as:  This was a Debian and Ubuntu specific issue, and only Ubuntu had supported releases with this flaw present (the issue never made it to Debian stable).
