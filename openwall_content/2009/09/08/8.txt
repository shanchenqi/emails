Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Cc: oss-security <oss-security@...ts.openwall.com> Subject: CVE Request - glib symlink copying permission exposure  Hi,  I'd like to request a CVE for an issue where glib causes symlink targets to gain permissions when any symlink pointing at the target is copied.  There is no privilege escalation, but it can lead to situations where other users on a system could have read/write access to important files (e.g. .ssh/id_rsa).
