I'm late on fixes these days.

Personally I have no problem referencing an old CVE in a recent commit if it helps tracking common bugs. And I think we've already done that in the past.  > I did not check if any of the affected code is possibly normally only > available to root, but even if so the issue may be relevant on systems > with containers.  In general I tend to consider those "bytes leak" bugs with lower importance, but they need to be fixed anyway since they may eventually impact some random setup somewhere.
