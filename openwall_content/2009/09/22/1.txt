PHP bug which is part of the PHP announcement, focuses on an "e" or "er" value in the second argument.  It also suggests the core problem is in the Microsoft C function _fdopen.  The issue may well be the same - maybe _fdopen doesn't handle *any* invalid mode string, and the exploit has "A" as the first character, which is invalid.  The actual behavior of _fdopen is not immediately clear to me.  Maybe there's really a buffer overflow going on.  also doesn't seem to mention anything about Windows, so maybe this applies to other OSes.  The scope of PHP bug may be very limited, but since the vendor is trying to communicate that it's a security problem to its customers, it's still reasonable to assign a CVE to it (momentarily).  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
