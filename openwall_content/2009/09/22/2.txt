The implication that there were two fixes, one in and one in is also confusing because if a fix in didn't work, we'd normally assign a new CVE for the fix in  is below, anchored on what's said in Bugzilla Since also mentions do_open_permission, I used that as a reference. This suggests the problem was fixed in but this issue doesn't have a CVE identifier because security implications weren't spelled out until Eugene's post (as far as I can tell.)  - Steve   ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Acknowledged: yes bug-report Announced: Flaw: other Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] CVE request: kernel: issue with O_EXCL creates on NFSv4 Reference: Reference: Reference:  NFSv4 in the Linux kernel and possibly other versions, does not properly clean up an inode when an O_EXCL create fails, which causes files to be created with insecure settings such as setuid bits, and possibly allows local users to gain privileges, related to the execution of the do_open_permission function even when a create fails. That also explains why we don't see this problem with root...the permission check is always passing there (provided we're not root squashing).   Analysis: ACCURACY/ACKNOWLEDGEMENT: bug says "What's happening here is that the inital create is occurring, but then the permission check for the open fails. This short-circuits the rest of the process, causes the open to return an error and leaves the inode in this funky state."
