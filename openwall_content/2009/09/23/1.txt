Hi Steve,  Sorry for the confusion.  The upstream commit should just be  On an O_EXCL create, the kernel was passing a bogus mode to the  vfs_create() op, which caused the file to be created with non-sensical  (and possibly unsafe) permissions. The intention was to pass a mode with  all of the permission bits cleared, but the field wasn't necessarily  zeroed out.  When the create is successful, this isn't very noticable. The client  will follow up the create with a SETATTR call and fix the mode and  permissions. Still, there was a window of opportunity where the file  might have "unsafe" perms even when the CREATE op returns success.  This was a long standing problem fixed in or so, seemingly  inadvertently as part of the merge of the NFSv4.1 code.  The other two commits were for another bug that we fixed.
