(Also potential pre-auth code execution.)    2)  NUL injection in certificate names:    3)  | The Shibboleth software supports the use of SAML metadata to | identify authentication and encryption keys by means of the | <KeyDescriptor> element. In previous versions, the software | was improperly ignoring the "use" attribute and treating all | elements as valid for both signing/TLS and encryption.   Isolated patches are available here:   Be careful when applying them---one hunk touches an inline function in a header-only C++ class with virtual functions (see the mailing list discussion).
