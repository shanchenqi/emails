This flaw was further investigated based on the flaws list, as mentioned in:         http://intevydis.com/vd-list.shtml  Relevant FreeRADIUS record:  Freeradius (1)	 Name: 	 FreeRADIUS DoS Status: 	 0day Details: 	 The exploit crashes 'radiusd' daemon.Found with ProtoVer testsuite. Listener: 	 not necessary Platform: 	 Linux x86 Vulndisco: 	 7.6  So once you assign a CVE identifier for the DoS, there is no need to assign another one for the above (to avoid dupes).
