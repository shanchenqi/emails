Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: More like issues  Hi!  problems were identified and fixed in some more applications...  wget - bunch of relevant links are available in here:    mutt, when using OpenSSL, fixed via:   This only applies to and later, as no name check was done in earlier versions when OpenSSL was used for crypto, which is a problem by itself:    Qt got earlier versions of KDE use own crypto wrapper implemented in kdelibs, which is affected too:    OpenLDAP upstream did some changes that addressed this in OpenSSL wrapping code, along with change related to handling of multiple CNs:   They also changed GnuTLS code to check the last CN instead of the first one, but this was not affected by problems:   NSS wrapper was re-written too to do name checking itself and not rely on NSS should likely apply here directly and patched NSS should be sufficient to address null prefix issue in this case; I've not tested though, do your own tests if you build OpenLDAP with NSS):    --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
