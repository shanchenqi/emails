Looks like this actually got split to two after all...  Multiple format string vulnerabilities in lib/silcclient/client_entry.c in Secure Internet Live Conferencing (SILC) Toolkit before and SILC Client before allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in a nickname field, related to the (1) silc_client_add_client, (2) silc_client_update_client, and (3) silc_client_nickname_format functions.  Which corresponds to this commit:   Multiple format string vulnerabilities in lib/silcclient/command.c in Secure Internet Live Conferencing (SILC) Toolkit before and SILC Client and earlier, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in a channel name, related to (1) silc_client_command_topic, (2) silc_client_command_kick, (3) silc_client_command_leave, and (4) silc_client_command_users.  Which corresponds to (the second part of) this commit:   Btw, SILC seems to implement own snprintf function, that is not only wrapper around system snprintf, so glibc hardening may not help here (I've not tried to confirm that with real PoC though).  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
