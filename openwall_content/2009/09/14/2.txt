Davem generally handles his own -stable queue for the net subsystem and submits fixes himself, but that's nice to notify about upcoming patches in case it gets missed !  > Willy, this affects upstream 2.4 I believe.  Indeed, it seems so. I'm queuing it up for next release. I will have to review it since the changes are not obvious. If you're aware of any reproducer, I'd be glad to get it (in private) ; I'd like to at least ensure I don't break the driver while trying to fix it !  Thanks!
