The atalk_rcv() function then directly returns that value to its  caller. There is a missing call to kfree_skb() in these unaccepted  IP-DDP datagram that can exhaust the kernel memory eventually. It  affects Linux hosts with appletalk and ipddp modules loaded, that are  attached to the same link. Thanks to Mark Smith for reporting this issue  to us.  net-next-2.6 commit:    Possible mitigation method:  Reference:  Greg, this should go to -stable.  Willy, this affects upstream 2.4 I believe.
