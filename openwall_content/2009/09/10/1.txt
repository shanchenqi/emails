Here are the two descriptions from Petr:   Manipulated EMF files can lead to heap overflows and arbitrary code execution      * Synopsis: Manipulated EMF files can lead to heap overflows and                 arbitrary code execution     * State: Resolved  1. Impact  A security vulnerability with the way OpenOffice/Go-oo 2.x and 3.x process EMF files may allow a remote unprivileged user who provides an OpenOffice.org/Go-oo document that is opened by a local user to execute arbitrary commands on the system with the privileges of the user running OpenOffice.org/Go-oo. No working exploit is known right now.  2. Affected releases  The problem was introduced in OpenOffice.org release, based on ooo-build (Go-oo), version 2.1. It was fixed in the version The original OpenOffice.org builds, available from http://www.openoffice.org/, were not affected.  3. Symptoms  There are no predictable symptoms that would indicate this issue has occurred  4. Relief/Workaround  There is no workaround. See "Resolution" below.  5. Resolution  This issue is addressed in the following release:  OpenOffice.org, based on ooo-build (Go-oo), version  Note: The original OpenOffice.org builds, available from http://www.openoffice.org/, were newer affected by this vulnerability.  6. Comments  The issue is similar to The ooo-build-specific variant was found and fixed by ooo-build (Go-oo) developers.   And:  Manipulated EMF+ files can lead to heap overflows and arbitrary code execution      * Synopsis: Manipulated EMF+ files can lead to heap overflows and                 arbitrary code execution     * State: Resolved  1. Impact  A security vulnerability with the way OpenOffice/Go-oo 2.x and 3.x process EMF+ files may allow a remote unprivileged user who provides an OpenOffice.org/Go-oo document that is opened by a local user to execute arbitrary commands on the system with the privileges of the user running OpenOffice.org/Go-oo. No working exploit is known right now.   2. Affected releases  The problem was introduced in OpenOffice.org release, based on ooo-build (Go-oo), version It was fixed in the version Only the builds supporting EMF+ import (applying EMFPlus patchset) were affected. The original OpenOffice.org builds, available from http://www.openoffice.org/, were newer affected.   3. Symptoms  There are no predictable symptoms that would indicate this issue has occurred   4.
