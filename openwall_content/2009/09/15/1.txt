Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: kernel: missing capability check in z90crypt  There is a missing capability check in the z90crypt driver in the Linux  kernel. This missing check could allow a local, unprivileged user to  bypass intended capability restrictions. Thanks to Solar Designer for  reporting this issue to us.  Note that this does not affect upstream anymore.  @@ @@ z90crypt_unlocked_ioctl(struct file *fil       PRINTK("No longer issuing messages about depre"              "cated ioctl Z90STAT_PCIXCCCOUNT.\n");     }      tempstat = get_status_PCIXCCcount();     if (copy_to_user((int *)arg, &tempstat, sizeof(int)) != 0)      ret = -EFAULT;     break;     case Z90QUIESCE:     if (current->euid != 0) { <-- should check a capability      PRINTK("QUIESCE fails: euid %d\n",             current->euid);      ret = -EACCES;     } else {      PRINTK("QUIESCE device from PID %d\n", PID());      quiesce_z90crypt = 1;     }     break;  Thanks, Eugene  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
