Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE request: kernel: issue with O_EXCL creates on NFSv4  There is an issue with O_EXCL creates on NFSv4 that with enough  attempts, it is possible for a lingering file from a failed create that  is world-writable but only setuid execute as the user who is attempting  these creates. Fortunately, root is not susceptible to this bug, so a  setuid root file should not be possible. It might be possible to exploit  this to gain access as another user though.
