This seems to a large degree to be a kernel issue. Also how are applications involved in the whole picture?  To my own not so deep knowledge this issue seems to affect us even today.  Has anyone insights to that?  Ciao, Marcus  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
