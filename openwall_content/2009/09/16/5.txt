Well, I've just read the PDF from the outpost24 site, and it appears as TCP for dummies. It basically explains how to create connections without using connect().    1) everyone knows how to change ulimit -n + bind() to establish      hundreds of thousands of connections from a client to a server      using source IP ranges, without even having to fiddle with raw      sockets.    2) I don't see what is new in his stateless SYN/SYN-ACK/ACK method.      To the best of my knowledge it's been used for ages in network      testing. I even have a modified Netfilter TARPIT module designed      to do that to stress network equipments with millions of      connections when associated with a standard SYN flooder.  I think these guys are just trying once again to get all the lights on them before revealing trivial things, as it's becoming more and more common. It's fantastic to see press journalists speculate on what the isue might be !  So unless they reveal anything serious, right now it looks like pure fantasy. Or maybe I wasn't able to find relevant information on the subject :-/  Regards, Willy   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
