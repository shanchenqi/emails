Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: watch for LDAP anonymous binds and empty passwords   FYI, we've seen "LDAP anonymous binds and empty passwords" a couple times in CVE, the latest being PostgreSQL (IDs forthcoming).  This smells like a general vuln class to me, so developers may want to re-examine their LDAP support.  and are examples.  I haven't investigated closely but the pattern may be that a blank password can return successful authentication when anonymous binds are allowed.  There's a relatively rare history of LDAP-specific vulns, which suggests to me that not a lot of people have been looking for this.  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
