"Some vulnerabilities have been reported in VLC Media Player, which can be exploited by malicious people to potentially compromise a user's system.  1) A boundary error exists within the "ASF_ObjectDumpDebug()" function in modules/demux/asf/libasf.c. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted ASF file.  2) A boundary error exists within the "AVI_ChunkDumpDebug_level()" function in modules/demux/avi/libavi.c. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted AVI file.  3) A boundary error exists within the "__MP4_BoxDumpStructure()" function in modules/demux/mp4/libmp4.c. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted MP4 file."
