Vulnerabilities as this, but only for some proprietary product, are leading some security scanners like nessus, but not only,  to signal vulnerability for LDAP bind null, LDAP null base SEARCH and so. For this many LDAP administrators are forced by their security deparment,who are ignorant of these details but follow what they say the tools without understanding the implications, to configure their LDAP server by disabling the anonymous bind in general, also to the LDAP root DSE. But this is in direct violation of RFC LDAP and subsequently causing a large quantity of issues with other products that follow the RFC.  Free to ask if you want more details.
