We weren't tracking kernel bugs at the function-name level back then, though - we were using more mature (and more general) advisory descriptions - so I can't be absolutely sure whether there's a CVE for this or not.  However, a search for "netlink" turned up empty for this type of problem in that time frame, so we probably don't have a CVE for it yet.  One question, though - patches net/sched/sch_api.c / tc_fill_tclass, but the patch includes net/core/neighbour.c, net/sched/cls_api.c, and others.  So we have:  tc_fill_qdisc() - already fixed in 2.6; just fixed in 2.4      (not sure of reference for 2.4)  multiple functions e.g. tcf_fill_node() already fixed in 2.6; unknown status in 2.4.  Includes neightbl_fill_info(), neightbl_fill_param_info(), and others.     tc_fill_tclass() - just fixed in 2.6      So for now, we have:    - tc_fill_tclass()    - tc_fill_qdisc()  (at least)  Now we have:    tcf_fill_node(), neightbl_fill_info(), and others from  Typical practice would be to associate tcf_fill_node() and the others with not just have it be with tc_fill_qdisc() - because they were all disclosed in  Then the 2.4 fix might only apply to a portion of  This could make it difficult to coordinate low-level patches, but our "(1)" and "(2)" numbering style in the CVE description could be used at that level if needed.  So, let's go with these two numbers.  I'll fill them out later.  (My head hurts.)  Oh, and if anybody could give me more precise version information than "2.4" and "2.6" then that would be appreciated.  - Steve   P.S. I chose the date in the CVE to help with distinguishing the problems, but arguably this should have received a because the fix was so vague that the security implications weren't (apparently) known until  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
