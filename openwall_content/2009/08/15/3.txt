I have applied the 2.4.x patch on the gnutls_2_4_x branch, so it will be built and tested by the daily autobuilder from now on.  I've tested that the self-test works as expected with the 2.4 library. So in theory, it should be easy for me to make a release from that branch.  I wonder if this would helps anyone, though?  I'd imagine that most people concerned with older releases are distributions that have to support older GnuTLS releases.  And you aren't likely to use a new upstream release anyway, since you just apply the patches to your version.  I'm also concerned that there have been plenty of _other_ serious problems in these old GnuTLS releases (check the security vulnerability page), and I haven't back-ported the fixes to those problems to these old branches.  So if I make a release on that branch, I'd have to check what other serious problems would needs to be fixed for that branch to be secure -- which sounds like real work (for little gain).  For these two reasons, I'd prefer to help you establish trust in the patches you developed rather than make releases on old branches.  I also added a link to your post on <http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/security.html> so others can find it easily.  /Simon  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
