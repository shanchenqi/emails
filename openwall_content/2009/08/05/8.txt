Would this work?  I am generally wary of assigning umbrella CVEs for implementation bugs that lots of applications happen to contain at the same time.  That's like giving a single CVE for "FTP server buffer overflow via long USER name" - which has happened to at least 20 separate implementations in the past.  Generally, the only time that I find umbrella CVEs "tolerable" are during disclosures that involve massive sets of test cases and lots of implementations; the PROTOS SNMP disclosures from are the canonical example.  An umbrella CVE for a fundamental design problem is a different story because one "developer" made a mistake - the original designer.  So use for fetchmail (I'll fill it in later) and Tomas, even if it results in dozens of CVEs, I suspect this is how we should go.  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
