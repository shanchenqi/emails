Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE request - kernel: information leak in sigaltstack  do_sigaltstack: avoid copying 'stack_t' as a structure to user space  Ulrich Drepper correctly points out that there is generally padding in the structure on 64-bit hosts, and that copying the structure from kernel to user space can leak information from the kernel stack in those padding bytes.  Avoid the whole issue by just copying the three members one by one instead, which also means that the function also can avoid the need for a stack frame. This also happens to match how we copy the new structure from user space, so it all even makes sense.
