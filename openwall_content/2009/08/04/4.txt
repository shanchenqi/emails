According to MITRE's descriptions, deals with a lack of enforcing "buffer limites and related bound checks", and deals with malformed requests.  When I was looking, it didn't seem like either of these were the issue noted in the Debian bug.  Bug on the squid site is still UNCONFIRMED with no additional comments made to it, so I don't think this is fixed in the latest upstream release (and wouldn't fall under one of these CVE's).  I don't think a CVE has been assigned to this issue, and I don't think it has been fixed.  --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
