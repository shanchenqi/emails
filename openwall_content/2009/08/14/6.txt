This is a first pass, have only been very lightly tested and have not been thoroughly looked at (you've been warned). They are not intended for production use yet, but hopefully others will be able to use them and provide feedback.  and needed an additional patch[2] which adds wide wildcard hostname matching. Ubuntu will likely carry this patch, but it may not be appropriate for everyone. 2.x passes the test mentioned in the advisory. does not pass the CN test yet, though at first glance certtool output looks comparable to the others. These patches are against Ubuntu sources and not clean tarballs.
