The bug was apparantly intended to be kept private,  but the bug changes were mailed to a public mailing list and Python  developrs menitoned the bug fix in their public svn (including NEWS  file, and reproducers):   While the expat bug was reported by Peter Valchev of Google, Python  credits Ivan KrstiÄ of Apple with the patch (submission). It might also be related to / FICORA  As CERT-FI never released any details or test cases, I have no idea if  we need a new CVE of if those two issues are the same.
