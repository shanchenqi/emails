Following up an earlier question of mine (umbrella CVE for a class of   problems, here: weak name verification that terminates early on   embedded NUL bytes):  Mandriva Security (I think it was them - if I recall correctly) wrote in   their fetchmail security advisory something along the lines of   [...] related to (with some more details).   This is probably the best way around this problem of how do we assign and   organize: We have the individual CVE name for the fetchmail weakness (so   it can be tracked), and we also have as reference the CVE name of the   first published issue that sort of founded a problem class, by instance of   Mozilla NSS.  here turns into some dual-use: (1) to track the   library/Mozilla application bug, (2) to name the problem class.  Perhaps this should/could be considered a pragmatic solution to the   "umbrella CVE" problem I posed earlier.  --  Matthias Andree  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
