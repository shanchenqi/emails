Sorry for the delay.  A new CVE is not needed. These two issues (the one which was fixed in expat CVS in June and the one with the internal copy of expat in Python) are essentially the same. The issue seems to be first found by Peter Valchev in June As Robert mentioned, the issue has been fixed in expat's CVS in June but an updated release was not made for some reason. The issue was also present in the expat bundled with Python and it was reported to us independent from the original issue (even though the reason of the crash is the same). CERT-FI reported the issue to Python in July Soon after that the issue was reported to expat maintainers too since initially we did not know that the issue was already fixed in expat's CVS. Python's patch has been incorporated into Python but there is probably more software with an affected internal copy of expat out there.
