A big factor in all this confusion was that the original advisory did not explicitly state which CVE was associated with which issue.  The scale of the effort also complicates things, as happens with all PROTOS/fuzzing/test-suite projects due the size and complexity of those efforts combined with lack of clarity of codebase relationships and the stray coordination problem (i.e., "it comes with the territory.")  I've been a bit concerned about CVE assignments because the lack of details may be causing us to assign duplicate CVEs or to combine multiple problems into a single ID.  I have several questions at this point:  1) neon "when expat is used" was subject to the billion laughs attack    (recursion during entity expansion).  This was assigned    The description for focuses on neon, and I haven't seen    it used for other products.  Was this really a problem in expat?  Then    we may have a dupe.  2) If per (1) this is really a problem in expat, then is the    neon problem the same as which is described for Apache    APR-util?  Or is apr-util an entirely different library/codebase than    expat?  3) is for a stack consumption problem in Xerces C++    involving nested parentheses and invalid byte values.  It appears that    expat and Xerces are distinct libraries, i.e. they don't have any    significant shared code?  4) is for Xerces Java which is used in JRE/JDK and    presumably others.  The impact here is an infinite loop.  Is this    really a distinct problem than whatever is talking about?  5) CERT-FI's response to the inquiry about the Python "libexpat"    being the same as the "expat" issue seemed to imply that    is about expat... since that's the CVE that was used in the inquiry.    However, I thought from point 3 that expat and Xerces are distinct    libraries, which means the CVEs *wouldn't* be the same, because    explicitly names Xerces.  Also, for *none*    of the primary sources (Fedora, Red Hat, Mandriva, Sun) mention expat    in their advisories.  6) The only recent CVE assignment that focuses on expat seems to be    related to the billion laughs attack  So does this    mean that there weren't any other problems related to "infinite loop"    or "unexpected byte values and recursive parentheses" with memory    corruption?  If there were, then what are their CVEs?  (Distinct CVEs    would be needed because corruption/infinite-loop/"unexpected byte    values" suggest different vuln types than billion-laughs?)  bonus) Is Xerces vulnerable to the billion laughs attack?  If so, was this    covered in the CERT-FI advisory and does it map to any of the    previously-provided CVE names?   I'm sure there's even more confusion than this, but it's a good start.   - Steve  ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Reference: Reference: MISC:http://www.codenomicon.com/labs/xml/ Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference:  Stack consumption vulnerability in validators/DTD/DTDScanner.cpp in Apache Xerces C++ and allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via vectors involving nested parentheses and invalid byte values in "simply nested DTD structures," as demonstrated by the Codenomicon XML fuzzing framework.   ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Reference: Reference: Reference: MLIST:[apr-dev] [PATCH] prevent "billion laughs" attack against expat Reference: Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] CVE request: "billion laughs" attack against Apache APR Reference: Reference: Reference: CONFIRM:http://www.apache.org/dist/apr/CHANGES-APR-UTIL-1.3 Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference:  The expat XML parser in the apr_xml_* interface in xml/apr_xml.c in Apache APR-util before as used in the mod_dav and mod_dav_svn modules in the Apache HTTP Server, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a crafted XML document containing a large number of nested entity references, as demonstrated by a PROPFIND request, a similar issue to   ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Reference: MLIST:[neon] fix for "billion laughs" attack against expat Reference: Reference: MLIST:[neon] neon: release (SECURITY) Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference:  neon before when expat is used, does not properly detect recursion during entity expansion, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (memory and CPU consumption) via a crafted XML document containing a large number of nested entity references, a similar issue to   ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Reference: Reference: MISC:http://www.codenomicon.com/labs/xml/ Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference:  Apache Xerces2 Java, as used in Sun Java Runtime Environment (JRE) in JDK and JRE 6 before Update 15 and JDK and JRE 5.0 before Update 20, and in other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and application hang) via malformed XML input, as demonstrated by the Codenomicon XML fuzzing framework.
