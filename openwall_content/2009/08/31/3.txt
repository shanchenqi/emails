Anyway, prefix requirement is another mitigation, as one may not be able to get valid certificate for a prefix of arbitrary host name (though it may be easier for TLDs as .com and .net via .co and .ne).  Speaking of prefixes, has anyone checked IO-Socket-SSL for issues?  If there is an issues, should it get fixed in IO-Socket-SSL or in Net-SSLeay?  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
