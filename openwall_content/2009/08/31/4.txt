If there is a problem it has to be fixed in Net::SSLeay, IO::Socket::SSL is perl only and perl itself has no problems with strings containing \0. >From the code in SSLeay.xs I would say, that this part should be no problem, because it explicitly uses ASN1_STRING_length to specify the length of the string. But I'm not sure about the use of where it magically converts an into a perl string. I keep you updated once I've checked it.
