I'd like to get some CVE ids for these.  |    ASN1: Fix stack variable overwrite when encoding OID. | |    The call to sscanf specifies a format string of "%lu", a long unsigned |    int.  The pointer argument was cast to unsigned long *, but this is |    wrong for 64 bit systems.  On 64 bit systems, unsigned long is 64 bits, |    but the oid value is a SilcUInt32 on all systems.  As a result, sscanf |    will overwrite a neighboring variable on the stack.  Fix this by |    changing the format string to "%u" and removing the cast.  |    Fixed string format vulnerability in client entry handling. | |    Reported and patch provided by William Cummings.  This one allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code, tested.  |     More string format fixes in silcd and client libary  From what I see this is only a problem if full_channel_names settings is used in SilcClientParams and can't be triggered by an attacker but only by the victim, maybe I miss something, I'm not that familar with the silc protocol.  |    HTTP: fix stack overwrite due to format string error. |     |    On AMD64, %lu refers to a 64-bit unsigned value, but the address passed |    to sscanf points to a 32-bit unsigned value.  This causes an adjoining |    value on the stack to be overwritten with data from the converted |    integer.  Fix the format string to match the size of the supplied value, |    and remove the pointer cast.  This is only a problem if the internal http server e.g. for checking stats is enabled.  Can I get CVE ids for the above issues? The upstream patch is attached.
