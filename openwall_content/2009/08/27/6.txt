Sorry about that. We will make our future advisories more explicit on the CVE references and the details. The test-suite/fuzzing tool projects sometimes make it pretty complicated to handle all the separate issues in a proper way. I am trying to clarify some of the confusion in my answers here.

The expat and/or Xerces -maintainers are probably the right people to give a comprehensive answer for questions 1-3. However, based on the code I have been reading during the coordination, I think that expat and Xerces do not share much code.  > 4) is for Xerces Java which is used in JRE/JDK and >    presumably others.

Yes, these are two distinct issues with significantly different reproducers.  > 5) CERT-FI's response to the inquiry about the Python "libexpat" >    being the same as the "expat" issue seemed to imply that >    is about expat... since that's the CVE that was used in the inquiry. >    However, I thought from point 3 that expat and Xerces are distinct >    libraries, which means the CVEs *wouldn't* be the same, because >    explicitly names Xerces.

Even though the question was pretty clear. There probably is not a CVE for the expat crash (which affected Python expat too) yet. As the original issue was not handled by us and it was found already back in we did not allocate a CVE for the Python expat issue. So we probably need a CVE for the expat crash. I assume we could use this CVE for the Python expat crash too since the root cause is the same.  > 6) The only recent CVE assignment that focuses on expat seems to be >    related to the billion laughs attack  So does this >    mean that there weren't any other problems related to "infinite loop" >    or "unexpected byte values and recursive parentheses" with memory >    corruption?  If there were, then what are their CVEs?  (Distinct CVEs >    would be needed because corruption/infinite-loop/"unexpected byte >    values" suggest different vuln types than billion-laughs?)  We are not aware of any other problems. In addition to the billion laughs issue with some code using expat, the only recent expat issue we are aware of is this segfault in expat's updatePosition -function when parsing multibyte characters. Our advisory does not cover any other expat issues than the Python expat -related part of the latter one.  > bonus) Is Xerces vulnerable to the billion laughs attack?

I hope this clarifies the situation. I am sorry for the confusion for our part.
