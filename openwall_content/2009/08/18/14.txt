I assumed and earlier at this stage.  ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Reference: MLIST:[linux-kernel] [PATCH v2] execve: must clear current->clear_child_tid Reference: Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] CVE request - kernel: execve: must clear current->clear_child_tid Reference: Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] Re: CVE request - kernel: execve: must clear current->clear_child_tid Reference:  The execve function in the Linux kernel, possibly and earlier, does not properly clear the current->clear_child_tid pointer, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a clone system call with CLONE_CHILD_SETTID or CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID enabled, which is not properly handled during thread creation and exit.
