Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: Re: CVE request: kernel: parisc: isa-eeprom missing  lower bound check   I wasn't sure how to interpret the phrase "poke in random memory" from the bug comment and there wasn't enough source code context, so I guessed that the impact is reading unexpected memory, but maybe it's also a crash or whatever.  - Steve   ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] CVE request: kernel: parisc: isa-eeprom missing lower bound check Reference: Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] Re: CVE request: kernel: parisc: isa-eeprom missing lower bound check Reference: Reference:  The eisa_eeprom_read function in the parisc isa-eeprom component (drivers/parisc/eisa_eeprom.c) in the Linux kernel before allows local users to access restricted memory via a negative ppos argument, which bypasses a check that assumes that ppos is positive and causes an out-of-bounds read in the readb function.
