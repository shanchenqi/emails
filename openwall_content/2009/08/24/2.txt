It does not enforce SSL/TLS and  seems to connect without encryption, although the box is ticked.  See Debian Bug here:  This upstream commit was pointed out to me:  Reporter promised to check whether gaim is affected too, so I guess the  bugreport will be updated.  Could I please get a CVE id for this?
