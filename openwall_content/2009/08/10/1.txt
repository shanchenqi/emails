Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE request: kernel: parisc: isa-eeprom missing lower bound check  loff_t is a signed type. If userspace passes a negative ppos, the "count" range check is weakened. If ppos is negative, the readb() later in the function will poke in random memory. Only affects if you are using a PA-RISC kernel with CONFIG_EISA set.
