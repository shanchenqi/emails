I implied here, and stated in the message to the mailing list, that neon  was not affected by this issue if linked against GnuTLS or later,  rather than OpenSSL.  This was not correct.    Versions of neon <= linked against any version of GnuTLS  (including >= are still vulnerable to at least one type of  embedded-NUL issue.    It is necessary to upgrade to neon to fix the issue completely,  if built against GnuTLS.  So far as this vulnerability affects neon, it is neither sufficient nor  necessary to update to GnuTLS  (i.e. neon will not be  vulnerable if linked against older versions of GnuTLS)  Apologies for the confusion, and hope this is clear.
