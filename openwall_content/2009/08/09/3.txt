The description is:    It was discovered that the Debian Mantis package, a web based bug   tracking system, installed the database credentials in a file with   world-readable permissions onto the local filesystem. This allows   local users to acquire the credentials used to control the Mantis   database.    References:      Can we get a CVE id for this? Thanks!
