First one: pdfroff tool of groff is creating files in a insecure manner  in the /tmp directory.  Second: pdfroff tool of groff is calling ghostscript with the  -dSAFER command line option. From the manpage:         -dSAFER               Disables  the  "deletefile"  and  "renamefile" operators and the               ability to open files in any mode other  than  read-only.   This               strongly  recommended  for spoolers, conversion scripts or other               sensitive  environments  where  a  badly  written  or  malicious               PostScript  program  code must be prevented from changing impor-               tant files.  This allows an attacker to delete or rename arbitrary victim owned files.  Can you allocate CVE ids for that?
