The reporter didn't really : provide much in the way of a reproducer or relevant configs (and the : reference to zope auths makes me not even want to touch it). :  : Has anyone taken a look at this or has a CVE been requested for it? : Upstream has done nothing with this despite it being reported two weeks : ago. :  : [1] : [2]   Were these fixed with the recent release?   The creditee section does not mention Bastian Blank (original) or Luigi  Gangitano (Debian, reported upstream). The related Squid bug report  is still marked UNCONFIRMED and has no resolution.  I'm guessing this is still an outstanding issue.  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
