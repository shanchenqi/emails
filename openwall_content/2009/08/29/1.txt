Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: Re: CVE request: perl-IO-Socket-SSL certificate hostname compare bug  Hi,  Just to make you able to classify the problem a bit more: The fix is important but the impact of the problem is in my opinion currently minor, because - the feature to help checking the hostname against the certificate is fairly new - in former times the apps/modules using IO::Socket::SSL had to implement   the checking by itself (using the appropriate logic, which differs between   various protocols). - most did not implement any checking at all or implemented a limited or wrong check - therefore I added the checks, where the app only has to decide how the check   has to be done - most apps/modules don't even do this simple thing yet, so that this buggy   feature was not used  That means, that it only impacts apps/modules which depend on this feature and there are only few (or none) of these apps. But it would probably be nice to add a note to the CVE that apps/modules should start to implement proper  certificate checking and that it got easier with newer IO::Socket::SSL versions.
