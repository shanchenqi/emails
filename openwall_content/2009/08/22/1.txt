Obviously, this is a problem when the library is used in a context where the attacker can set environment variables.  For instance, if a PAM module uses NSS to establish a TLS connection for authentication purposes, this allows a local attacker to enable features which make it easier to impersonate the authentication server.  I couldn't find any programs which might suffer from such a problem, though.
