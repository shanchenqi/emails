As soon as Suresh (or his coworkers at  Novell) have a patch - we (Jeff  and I etc.) will review it.  I think fixing these conversions to be  cleaner is important, although the risk of exploitable overflow is small  in practice.

The NativeFileSystem field is part of the Tree Connect response (TCon for short).  > And I wonder if "len*2" is sufficient, can't a UCS -> UTF8 conversion > generate more than 2 byte utf-8 characters for 1 ucs character?  I understand that someone from your side is working on a better patch for this. Do keep us updated when it goes upstream.
