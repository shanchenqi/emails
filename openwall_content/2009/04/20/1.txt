Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE request: kernel: cifs: fix unicode string area word alignment  in session setup  According to the upstream commit "the handling of unicode string area alignment is wrong. decode_unicode_ssetup improperly assumes that it will always be preceded by a pad byte. This isn't the case if the string area is already word-aligned.  This problem, combined with the bad buffer sizing for the serverDomain string can cause memory corruption. The bad alignment can make it so that the alignment of the characters is off. This can make them translate to characters that are greater than 2 bytes each. If this happens we can overflow the allocation."  This is similar to the bug Marcus posted recently.
