I think having an oss-security CNA that is not MITRE would be useful, and hopefully would alleviate some of the pressure MITRE currently feels. There would of course be collisions from time to time, but that's likely going to still cause less pain than the current model provides.  If this idea is appealing to MITRE, we could start working out some of the details.  --      JB  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
