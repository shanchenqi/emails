I believe that this is a by-product of vendors moving to use the public  oss-security list for triaging issues.  Before oss-security, vendors like Red Hat would discuss vulnerabilies both  public and private on the private vendor-sec list.  At the end of the  discussion and peer review we'd reach some conclusion about if the issue  was actually a security issue, and one of the Candidate Naming Authorities  would allocate CVE names accordingly.  So usually CVE names would only get allocated for things that at least one  of the vendors was going to fix, and therefore the CVEs had a high level  of confidence, and lots of metadata.  For example if Red Hat fix an issue in any of our products we've got a  public bug with the CVE name as alias which contains the details, link to  first public mention, and a link to the fix or the fix itself (either the  upstream one or a backported one). For issues where it was likely that  Mitre would allocate a name by themselves (say a new version of PHP got  released with security issues mentioned in the announcement) we'd ping  Steve directly for a name to try to avoid duplicates (and in these cases  Steve and his team would need to do more work).  However, for issues already public, using a closed list was not optimal,  and so to aid peer review outside of the vendor security teams and for  transparancy we started using oss-security.  But what happens now is that all the triage work that was previously  hidden is now public.  So while on vendor-sec we might have used a CVE  name for tracking an issue through triage and later rejected it with no  public mentions, now it's public in the interim.  In the case of the Linux kernel bug Eugene was working on, that triage  also includes the CVE Content Decisions to map vulnerabilities to CVE  names where there were multiple similar vulnerabilities or multiple  affected products at the same time.  If this were vendor-sec, one of the  CNA experts would have stepped in at that point.  I don't think intermediate ids would help, and we're years past having a  lower-confidence CVE 'candidate' (CAN).  So perhaps the solution is to have the vendor CNAs play more of a role on  the oss-security list in allocating and helping with content decisions  rather than having to have Mitre monitor the list.  Then, each time a CNA  gives out a CVE on oss-security they could have some requirement of a  mimimum set of information about the allocation they have to provide in  the same mail.  By having the CNA buffer we'd only have to involve Steve  or Mitre when something is complex.  However, that would mean Mitre would  have to check oss-security list before allocating any CVE names for  oss-issues and accept there may be more duplicate allocations.
