Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE request: kernel: NFS: Fix an Oops in encode_lookup()  According to the upstream commit the NFS file name limit is not being initialised correctly in the struct nfs_server. The problem can be easily triggered by a local, unprivileged user. We need to make sure that we limit whatever is being set in nfs_probe_fsinfo() and nfs_init_server(). We also need to ensure that readdirplus and nfs4_path_walk respect our file name limits.
