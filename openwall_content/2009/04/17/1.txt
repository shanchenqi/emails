I am still able to reproduce the problem even after applying this upstream patch (commit I'm still figuring out what other patches are needed. If you know which ones, do let us know.  The expected behaviour for this is: # ps -e   PID TTY          TIME CMD     1 pts/0    bash <-- this namespace's "init"    10 pts/0    ps # /bin/kill -s SIGKILL -1 kill -1: No such process  Take note that you need to be privileged in order to create a new PID namespace, but to be able to kill other invisible processes outside of the namespace is a bypass of the intended namespaces isolation.
