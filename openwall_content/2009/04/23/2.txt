Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE request: kernel: missing capabilities in fs_mask  "When POSIX capabilities were introduced during the 2.1 Linux cycle, the fs mask, which represents the capabilities which having fsuid==0 is supposed to grant, did not include CAP_MKNOD and CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE. However, before capabilities the privilege to call these did in fact depend upon fsuid==0.  This patch introduces those capabilities into the fsmask, restoring the old behavior.  See the thread starting at for reference.  Note that if this fix is deemed valid, then earlier kernel versions (2.4 and 2.2) ought to be fixed too.  Changelog:  [Mar 23] Actually delete old CAP_FS_SET definition...  [Mar 20] Updated against J. Bruce Fields's patch"  References:  Thanks, Eugene --  Eugene Teo / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
