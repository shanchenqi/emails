The vulnerability is caused due to a format string error within the PN-DCP dissector when processing station names containing format string specifiers. This can be exploited to cause a crash and potentially execute arbitrary code via specially crafted packets captured off the wire or loaded via a capture file. --------8<---------  [1]:  I couldn't find any related CVE request, can you assign one?
