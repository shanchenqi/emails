Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE request: PHP  Hi!  PHP was released some time ago, mentioning couple of security fixes, that do not seem to have CVEs assigned:    # Fixed explode() behavior with empty string to respect negative limit.   (Shire)  Our maintainer has asked upstream about this one, as it changes behavior of explode() and does not have obvious security consequences. Upstream security team confirmed that this one was tagged as security by mistake.   # Fixed a crash on extract in zip when files or directories entry names   contain a relative path. (Pierre)  This should only affect php or versions that have original fix for backported.   # Fixed a segfault when malformed string is passed to json_decode().   (Scott)  This is PHP only, as previous versions do not have json extension.  Only two CVEs should be needed.
