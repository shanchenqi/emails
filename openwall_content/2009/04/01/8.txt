Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Cc: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: CVE request -- bibtex, pam_ssh  Hello Steve,    could you allocate new CVE ids for the following two issues:  1, bibtex invalid reads/writes when parsing big *.bib file           (valgrind reports suspicious behavior)    References:      (texlive-base-bin)    (tetex, texlive)     The problem is in bibtex, but looks like it is shipped    in various packages for various vendors.  2, pam_ssh Password prompt varies for existent and non-existent users    References:            While this is not problem of pam, pam_ssh is affected.    Also admit this is a very low security issue (affecting    special configurations), but in any case the password    prompt should be always the same. Successfully reproduced.
