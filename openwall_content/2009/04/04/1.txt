The data seems to come from a remote generated reply blob even, correct me if I am wrong. :/  Checking our enterprise distro kernels it seems to cover most of the 2.6 kernel range... has the same code, too, too.    And I wonder if "len*2" is sufficient, can't a UCS -> UTF8 conversion generate more than 2 byte utf-8 characters for 1 ucs character?
