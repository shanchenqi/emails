I was wondering if anyone has been having a closer look at the new ipsec-tools:   Upstream announcement mentions one security fix (DoS / NULL deref reported by Neil Kettle), fixed in:   But the "A bunch of memory leak and possible memory corruptions" part of announcement made me bit curious too, so I did have a look at the changelog.  * src/racoon/crypto_openssl.c: From Stephen Bevan: Fix a   signature verification memory leak.   This leak occurs during user authentication using certificates.  It's possible to reach it for unauthenticated users, though certificate itself is validated first, which mitigates this slightly.  * src/racoon/nattraversal.c: Fix a memory leak in nat-t keepalive   code.   This can occur during phase1 too, before authentication.  Requires nat-t to be enabled / allowed, leaks two struct sockaddr.  * src/racoon/: admin.c, racoonctl.c: Originally from Bin Li: Fix a   crash with racoonctl logout user.  This only affects recent version (e.g. on in or older), should be under admins control only.  * src/libipsec/policy_parse.y: From Paul Moore: Fix a heap   corruption bug (yacc return non-null terminated buffer and sprintf   writes over bounds).  Config file parser, not security.  * src/racoon/: isakmp_inf.c, isakmp_xauth.c, plog.c: Orignally from   Bin Li: Fix possible memory corruption in binsanitize().  I have not investigated this one too closely, as it does not affect versions we need to do backports for.  According to the related mailing list post, it can at least cause local racoon crash, when connecting to remote ipsec server with xauth authentication.   Has anyone else looked into this new ipsec-tools more closely and has some other findings to share?  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
