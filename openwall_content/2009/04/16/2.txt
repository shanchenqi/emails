Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE request: kernel: 'kill sig -1' must only apply to caller's PID  namespace  I came across this while reviewing some older upstream patches.  Apparently, it was possible to run kill <sig> -1 to kill processes in all PID namespaces, and break the isolation of namespaces. The expected behaviour for this is to only kill processes in its own hierarchy. The fix uses task_pid_vnr() to check if the process is outside of the caller's namespace before killing.  PID namespaces was merged in  References:  Thanks, Eugene --  Eugene Teo / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
