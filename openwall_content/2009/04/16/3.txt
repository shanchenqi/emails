That does not sound like a viable alternative and is likely to damage portability lot more, let me explain:  - Application upstreams will not (should not) use any API that is   vendor-specific extension and not included upstream.  Even if there   is some new upstream version, it might take years to get into wide   enough use to applications to use new API, and result in   incompatibility with old systems.  - Applications change would be required.  If that is done, there's   little reason to change to new API instead of existing hosts_access.  I fail to see benefits of new API, only greater risk.
