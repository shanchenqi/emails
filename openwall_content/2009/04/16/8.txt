See my previous email. Programs such as portmappers must not look up hostname information, since that would result in an infinite recursion when host lookups use SUNRPC services. To state the obvious: the portmapper would directly or indirectly send SUNRPC calls to itself, in order to locate the NIS server.  Before discussing changes to a program, it is a good investment of time to find out how the program works, and why it works in the specific way it works.
