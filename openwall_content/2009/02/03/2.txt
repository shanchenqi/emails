Analysis: ABSTRACTION: The researcher lists three issues in the advisory, two heap overflows and one array index error so these are SPLIT.  ABSTRACTION: One of the heap overflows affects different products than the other, so they are SPLIT.  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT: The vendor states in release notes for "Fix for security advisory which references the researcher, who states "Vendor has released an updated version" and notes the issue is resolved in the release.   ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Acknowledged: yes changelog Announced: Flaw: other Reference: GStreamer Heap Overflow and Array Index out of Bounds Vulnerabilities Reference: Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] CVE Request -- (sort of urgent) gstreamer-plugins-good (repost) (more details about affected versions -- final version) Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference:  Array index error in the qtdemux_parse_samples function in gst/qtdemux/qtdemux.c in GStreamer Good Plug-ins (aka gst-plugins-good) through allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted Sync Sample (aka stss) atom data in a malformed QuickTime media .mov file, related to "mark keyframes."

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT: The vendor states in release notes for "Fix for security advisory which references the researcher, who states "Vendor has released an updated version" and notes the issue is resolved in the release.  WIKI: The MLIST:[oss-security] indicates that vulnerability [C] is about "QuickTime 'stts' Atom parsing" but then says "QuickTime Sync Sample Atom parsing." This is incorrect. An stts atom is a "Time-to-sample atom." (An stss atom is a "Sync Sample Atom.")   ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Acknowledged: unknown Announced: Flaw: other Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] CVE Request -- (sort of urgent) gstreamer-plugins-good (repost) (more details about affected versions -- final version) Reference:  Array index error in the gst_qtp_trak_handler function in gst/qtdemux/qtdemux.c in GStreamer Plug-ins (aka gstreamer-plugins) allows remote attackers to have an unknown impact via a crafted QuickTime media file.
