Today also found out, the version, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is not vulnerable to this issue (due some RH specific internal patch applied in between, which mitigates the impact of the flaw). So other vendors, please perform your own investigation, if particular version of net-snmp you ship is (isn't) affected.  Also checked state of (not sure if someone else ship it yet), this looks NOT to be affected to this flaw.
