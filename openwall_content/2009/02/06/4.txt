Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Cc: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: CVE Request - Wicd <=  In Wicd the dbus configuration file's default context allows any user to own the org.wicd.daemon object, thus potentially allowing a user receive messages intended for the wicd daemon. These messages could include, among other things, credentials for secure networks.

Here's the bzr commit with the fix:  About Wicd: Wicd <http://wicd.net> is a wired and wireless network manager application.
