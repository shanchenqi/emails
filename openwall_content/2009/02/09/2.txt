I've just added a direct link to the file in the SVN repository, as well as the Debian Wiki link above, to the "patch-finding" section for Debian on the oss-security wiki here:  http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/distro-patches  This is not exactly "patch-finding", but it is closely related - and it may be of help to security teams of other distros as well.
