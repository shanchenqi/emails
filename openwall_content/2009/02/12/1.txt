I believe this is a misinterpretation of the advisory, and upstream has confirmed that to me. There is only one issue and that is the one which refers to.  I suspect that this comes from a misundertanding of the text of this advisory: The problem is in a backend function, and this function is called from multiple pages, which means that the issue can be exploited through "several pages" as mentioned in the advisory which all accept the "table" parameter.  The patch referenced from the advisory patches one line in the backend function and is sufficient to resolve the things mentioned in  I propose that gets marked as a duplicate of or rejected.   cheers, Thijs  > - Steve > > > ====================================================== > Name: > Status: Candidate > URL: > Reference: > Reference: > Reference: > > Reference: > Reference: > > > Reference: > Reference: > > > Reference: > Reference: > Reference: > Reference: > Reference: > Reference: > > > Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in phpMyAdmin > before and 3.x before allows remote attackers to perform > unauthorized actions as the administrator via a link or IMG tag to > tbl_structure.php with a modified table parameter.
