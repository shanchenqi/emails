BTW that BID list of affected kernels isn't correct; the multibyte stuff  wasn't in at least.  I didn't check exactly where since it doesn't affect RHEL and didn't look  into the issue any further -- but on first glance it seemed like you'd  have to be a console user and display/select some carefully chosen  characters in order to do the overflow; so it's probably a 'local attacker  at keyboard' flaw?
