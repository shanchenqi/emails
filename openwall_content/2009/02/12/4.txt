Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: Re: CVE Request -- net-snmp (sensitive host information  disclosure)   I'm confused by the upstream diff being referenced by the Red Hat bug ID. Specifically, it looks like some sprintf's got changed, and the result is used for logging.  Is it certain that the attacker can bypass authorization, or is net-snmp just mis-reporting it?  I'm going with authorization bypass at the moment.  ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] CVE Request -- net-snmp (sensitive host information disclosure) Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference:  The netsnmp_udp_fmtaddr function (snmplib/snmpUDPDomain.c) in net-snmp through when using TCP wrappers for client authorization, does not properly parse hosts.allow rules, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and execute SNMP queries, related to "source/destination IP address confusion."
