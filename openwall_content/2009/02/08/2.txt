Still working on the best process to be able to respond more quickly.  The SQUID advisory doesn't state what kind of DoS it is, and it's not clear from the patches either.  Is it a crash, hang, resource consumption, etc.?  Not essential from a CVE perspective but probanly convenient to Squid users.  - Steve  ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Reference: Reference:  Squid 2.7 to 3.0 to and 3.1 to allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via an HTTP request with an invalid version number, which is not properly handled in (1) HttpMsg.c and (2) HttpStatusLine.c.
