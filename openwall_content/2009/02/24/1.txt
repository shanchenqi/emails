The fix for (upstream commit is incomplete. Note  that the same problem of leaking kernel memory will reappear if someone  on some architecture uses struct timeval with some internal padding (for  example tv_sec 64-bit and tv_usec 32-bit) --- then, you are going to  leak the padded bytes to userspace.  net: amend the fix for SO_BSDCOMPAT gsopt infoleak  Thanks, Eugene --  Eugene Teo / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
