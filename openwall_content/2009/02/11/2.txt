Cheers, TJ  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,    There is a rapture on the lonely shore,    There is society, where none intrudes,    By the deep sea and music in its roar:    I love not man the less, but Nature more,    From these our interviews, in which I steal    From all I may be, or have been before,    To mingle with the Universe, and feel    What I can ne'er express, yet cannot all conceal.        	-Lord Byron     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
