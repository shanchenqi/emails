They also affect different code bases:     Apache Xerces C++, while libxml / libxml2.  4,     CVE originally assigned to Apache Xerces2 Java (does it embed     its own copy of expat), but also reported as expat issue here:       http://expat.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/expat/expat/lib/xmltok_impl.c?view=log      Expat patch:            The expat library is embedded also in:       a, w3c-libwww http://www.w3.org/Library       b, PyXML http://pyxml.sourceforge.net/      And probably also in other packages (still need to get the complete list). In this case,     the reproducer, code base and patch are the same, just the expat library is embedded     in multiple other products. Two questions remain to be answered here:      a, Does Apache Xerces2 Java contain embedded copy ot the expat library (i.e. it's        completely the same issue as in expat, w3c-libwww, PyXML and others) - Marc        could you help to reply this question?      b, Can we use to reference expat, w3c-libwww(expat), PyXML (expat)        issues too or another one need to be assigned for these? (But the decision        depends on the answer to previous question).  Hoping this will bring at least a little bit more light into above [1] doubts  Thanks && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
