Similar to Adobe's issue, the same PDF proof-of-concept was used to crash ghostscript (multiple NULL pointer dereference flaws found in Ghostscript's JBIG2 compression format decoder).  If a CVE name was assigned for this, does anyone know it?  I can't find it.  If not, could one be assigned?  Details are available on our bugzilla:   Thanks.  --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
