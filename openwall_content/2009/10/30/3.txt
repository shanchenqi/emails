And the fixes brought in as part of those updates are possible spread across multiple upstream versions, which is a common reason to do a CVE split.  > Bug seems to be a liboggplay issue fixed by bug  It's listed among libvorbis bugs and I wasn't able to tell if there was only liboggplay-side issue.  > However, if you notice any issues yourself with the advisory, please > feel free to report any issues to me or to security@....  I've only added a comment to which seems to be a dupe of one older vorbis CVE.
