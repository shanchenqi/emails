I think we used one CVE per library upgrade, so three in total (libvorbis, liboggz, liboggplay). As for individual fixes, I don't really know if that's possible, as I mentioned earlier, due to the fact that fixes were dependent on other changes that you would need to backport, too, which all just ends badly. :(  > > I'll see if we can get those still private bugs concerning the media > > library fixes open sooner rather than later, though. >  > Even bugs don't make all points clear in this case.  Feel free to comment in the bugs asking questions. If you don't receive a response in a reasonable amount of time from one of the developers, drop me a note OOB, and I'll see about making sure somebody replies to you. I'm by no means the media library expert, so I don't know all of the details myself. Bug seems to be a liboggplay issue fixed by bug As for you'll just have to ask the developers.  I think the advisory is missing a few bugs and is mislabeling a few others. If I get a chance, I'll edit the advisories to add a few other bugs (like However, if you notice any issues yourself with the advisory, please feel free to report any issues to me or to security@.... We try to be good at bug dependencies, so if you loop through the bug chains, you may find some bugs that help you better understand all the issues that were fixed by the upgrades.  ~reed Mozilla Security Group  --  Reed Loden - <reed@...dloden.com>  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
