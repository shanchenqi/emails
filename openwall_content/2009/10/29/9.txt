We've got a rather strict backported-security-fixes-only policy because we've got a very interdependent code base, so we usually can't switch upstream versions for libraries because most developers have a rather lax attitude towards ABI compatibility (and even if they don't, we're usually trailing behind a major version or two 8-/).
