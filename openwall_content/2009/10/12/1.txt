Attached are some php patches that to me looks security related (unknown  impact). I hope someone with insight can classify and possible assign CVE  numbers. The patches were taken from their svn repo, so it's "official".  Cheers. --  Regards // Oden Eriksson  View attachment "php-5.3.x-safe_mode_bypass_fix.diff" of type "text/x-patch" bytes)  View attachment "php-5.2.x-safe_mode_bypass_fix.diff" of type "text/x-patch" bytes)  View attachment "php-5.2.x-open_basedir_bypass_fix.diff" of type "text/x-patch" bytes)  View attachment "php-5.3.x-open_basedir_bypass_fix.diff" of type "text/x-patch" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
