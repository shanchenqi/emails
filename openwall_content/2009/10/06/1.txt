The commit is here:  I've assigned this At the very least it's a DoS as it causes an OOPS due to a NULL pointer dereference, it may allow arbitrary code execution as the structure in question does contain function pointers. If someone who knows more than me wants to chime in here, please do.  I've filed a bug in the Red Hat Bugzilla:  It doesn't really contain any additional data. If I discover anything new, I'll add my comments there.  Thanks.  --      JB  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
