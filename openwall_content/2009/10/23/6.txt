Based on the above -^ I would vote for separate CVE identifier for expat flaw (and its embedded copies in dozen of packages):   To remember sounding of ---------------------------------------  Apache Xerces2 Java, as used in Sun Java Runtime Environment (JRE) in JDK and JRE 6 before Update 15 and JDK and JRE 5.0 before Update 20, and in other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and application hang) via malformed XML input, as demonstrated by the Codenomicon XML fuzzing framework.  Argumentation for new CVE id: ----------------------------- a, doesn't mention expat (just "other products", this could     be fixed though) b, The impact differs on Apache Xerces2 Java (infinite loop and application     hang, cpu use -- have checked unpatched and in expat     (clean crash) - gdb output attached for both testcases.  Steve, Josh, which way would be easier to follow? i, mention expat in change impact to DoS (crash)     via malformed XML file, which triggers UTF-8 parser crash? or ii. assign new CVE id for expat (and its embedded copies) with      clean impact description and note that crash happens in UTF-8      parser?  Opinions, ACKs, NACKs appreciated.
