Let me know if I've screwed any of these up.  In traditional CVE, it would have been appropriate to combine the following three issues, because they are the same flaw type (XSS) and affected versions, even though they are clearly distinct bugs:  > TYPO3 Cross-site scripting > >     TYPO3 versions and below, and below, and below, >     and below contain a cross-site scripting flaw where the TYPO3 >     backend failed to properly sanitize user input. > >     >     > > TYPO3 API function t3lib_div::quoteJSvalue XSS > >     TYPO3 versions and below, and below, and below, >     and below contain an unauthenticated cross-site scripting flaw >     in its API function t3lib_div::quoteJSvalue. > >     >     > > TYPO3 Install Tool XSS > >     TYPO3 versions and below, and below, and below, >     and below contain a cross-site scripting flaw in the Install >     Tool.

In this case, none of these three CVEs have exactly the same finder, so it's OK to let them remain split. (I'm somewhat nervous about the implications of this rule process-wise - and CVE assignment is already "weird enough" - but I'm continuing with this anyway.)  Note that the TYPO3 advisory doesn't explicitly state which bug is present in the 4.0.x series.  > TYPO3 Frontend Login Box (felogin) XSS > >     TYPO3 versions to contian contain a cross-site scripting flaw >     where the URL parameters of Frontend Login Box were not properly >     sanitized. > >     >      This would still remain distinct from the other XSS because the affected versions are different.  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
