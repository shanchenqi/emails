CVE may abstract on these:   Buffer overflow in the EMF parser implementation in OpenOffice.org (OOo)  in SUSE openSUSE through Novell Linux Desktop (NLD) 9, and  SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE) 10 and 11 has unknown impact and remote  attack vectors, related to enhwmf.cxx and emfplus.cxx.   Heap-based buffer overflow in svtools/source/filter.vcl/wmf/enhwmf.cxx in  Go-oo 2.x and 3.x before previously named ooo-build and related to  OpenOffice.org (OOo), allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code  via a crafted EMF file, a similar issue to   Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in  cppcanvas/source/mtfrenderer/emfplus.cxx in Go-oo 2.x and 3.x before  previously named ooo-build and related to OpenOffice.org (OOo),  allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted EMF+ file,  a similar issue to   1. and were created next to each other. That is usually a strong  indication that CVE chose to abstract between two issues.  2. is in OOo, while are in Go-oo, which was "previously ..  related to OOo". If Go-oo represents a code fork, there are two products  in question now. While CVE will merge products on similar issues, I don't  believe it is set in stone.  3. I may be totally off and they may be considered dupes. =)  OSVDB is  keeping them split for now, given the difference in products.
