A number of other GNOME-related applications which predate glib are vulnerable due to the commonality of this flawed code.  In all cases, heap memory is allocated using a length calculated with a user-supplied, platform-specifc value.  It follows the pattern below:    g_malloc(user_supplied_length * 3 / 4 + some_small_num)  Due to the evaluation order of arithmetic operations, the length is multiplied by 3 prior to division by 4.  This will allow the calculated argument used for allocation length to overflow resulting in a region which is smaller than expected.
