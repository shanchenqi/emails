Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE request: kernel: shm: fix shmctl(SHM_INFO) lockup with  	!CONFIG_SHMEM  According to the upstream commit shm_get_stat() assumes that the inode is a "struct shmem_inode_info", which is incorrect for !CONFIG_SHMEM (see fs/ramfs/inode.c: ramfs_get_inode() vs. mm/shmem.c: shmem_get_inode()).  This bad assumption can cause shmctl(SHM_INFO) to lockup when shm_get_stat() tries to spin_lock(&info->lock).  Users of !CONFIG_SHMEM may encounter this lockup simply by invoking the 'ipcs' command.
