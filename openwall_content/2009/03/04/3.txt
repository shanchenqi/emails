I have not received any response to this query upstream, and I was wondering if anyone else has noticed this issue, and if so, if they have any plans with regard to it.  rPath isn't shipping lxc at this point, so we have no plans for a security advisory. But does pre-configured account information including root and user passwords bother anyone else here?  ----- Forwarded message from "Michael K.

I'm guessing, from the contents of the tarball in lxc-sshd, that you might be responsible for building lxc-sshd.  I noticed three potential security issues while briefly perusing lxc-sshd:  o  Pre-packaged host keys instead of generating unique host keys     within the script or optionally copying the host keys from     the system on which you are running lxc-sshd  o  Pre-packaged root password instead of setting it in the script  o  Pre-packaged legoater password ditto  Obviously, the pre-packaged passwords are a potential security risk for you if you are using those passwords anywhere, and could also be considered to be "back doors" if they actually enable any access by default.  I haven't tested any of that -- it just seemed odd while inspecting the tarball contents.  In addition, I noticed /root/.bash_history was packaged in the tarball, which I am guessing was not intended.  ----- End forwarded message -----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
