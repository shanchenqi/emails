Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: kernel: rt_cache leak  Reported by Hector Herrera: A "REJECT" route in a software router (ip_forward = 1) based on CentOS  5.2 will cause the kernel to lose track of cached routes.  Once the  number of allocated route cache objects (as indicated by the value of  ip_dst_cache in /proc/slabinfo) reaches the value of  /proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/max_size - 1, the kernel will complain with a  'dst cache overflow' errors for every received packet and all network  connectivity will cease.  But was introduced in upstream commit It was later fixed in  upstream commit  Workaround: - either remove or replace the "REJECT" route with a different  alternative such as 'ip route add via - using iptables.
