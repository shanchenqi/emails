Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: Linux kernel minor signal handling vulnerability  Reported by Chris Evans: It's a relatively minor signal issue where a child can send its parent  process an arbitrary signal, even if the parent has a totally separate  real and effective user id. This could be a nuisance in the case where  long-running root daemons spawn direct child processes owned by  untrusted users [*]. There may even be worse consequences if privileged  processes have weak signal handling code for signals not normally  triggerable by untrusted users.  This is fixed in upstream kernel -  References:  Thanks, Eugene --  Eugene Teo / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
