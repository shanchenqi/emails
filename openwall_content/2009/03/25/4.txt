I suppose Debian and others may package it with a package name of libnss-ldapd.  nss-ldapd is a fork of nss_ldap... I don't know enough to say how much it differs, but for nss_ldap at least, /etc/ldap.conf should be world-readable (or at least typically is, with no real exposure since using non-anonymous binds to LDAP would be unusual -- at least from everything I've seen and done with LDAP authentication).  /etc/ldap.conf has nothing to do with openldap and while the filename, and probably file contents are the same, it sounds like libnss-ldap may require more protection and/or be meant to run with a protected configuration file.  It also, and someone correct me if I'm wrong, be due to the debian package allowing someone to specify a bindpw at install and then not protecting the file contents if someone does specify a bindpw.  With RHEL and Fedora, there are no mechanisms to ask a user for a bindpw (because it is not typical), so we would expect that an admin who puts a bindpw in there for a user that is meant to be protected (i.e. something other than an unprivileged user that suits the criteria for anonymous binds for the purpose of obtaining certain non-privileged user information), would also adequately protect the file when manually setting the password.  And, if that is the case, then I would argue this is a debconf-specific issue for this package than a general nss-ldapd-specific issue.  In fact, if you look here:   you'll see that this is noted as a "security problem in ... the Debian package configuration".  >Use to be filled in once I have some more detail.  --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
