A 64-bit process make a 32-bit system call with int  In both these cases, audit_syscall_entry() will use the wrong system call number table and the wrong system call argument registers.  This could be used to circumvent a syscall audit configuration that filters based on the syscall numbers or argument details.  Credit: Roland McGrath.
