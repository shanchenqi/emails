Hi,  While debugging a problem for a customer of us I found that UTMP entries are not generated reliably and utmp entry creation starts to fail on higher loads/more users or more utmp activity.  Reason is that glibc locks the UTMP file on write/read with a 1 second timeout, and if that 1 second timeout triggers no entry is written.  Sadly without any indication of failure if you use login(3) or pututline(3). :(   I am wondering if handling UTMP should be more reliable or if at least error reporting should happen.  Making it reliable will make it possible to DoS any kind of logins / terminal opens of course, but make it easier on app writers using utmp.   (Yes, I know the really reliable way is Audit, but this is not user readable.)
