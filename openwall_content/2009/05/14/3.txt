Also, there's another patch that I sent today:  commit Author: Jeff Layton <jlayton@...hat.com> Date:   Thu May 14      cifs: fix error handling in parse_DFS_referrals          cifs_strndup_from_ucs returns NULL on error, not an ERR_PTR          Signed-off-by: Jeff Layton <jlayton@...hat.com>     Signed-off-by: Steve French <sfrench@...ibm.com>  ...that patch is in Steve's tree but not yet in Linus'. It should make its way there soon though.  --  Jeff Layton <jlayton@...hat.com>  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
