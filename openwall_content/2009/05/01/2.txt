Looks like the Quagga code in bgp_aspath.c is assuming that converting each ASN of the AS path to a string will be 5 bytes plus a space (#define ASN_STR_LEN (5 + 1)).  Therefore, it allocates (ASN_STR_LEN * the number of ASNs in the path segment) bytes to snprintf into when creating the pretty-print version of the AS path.  This is all fine and dandy until we hit an AS path with 32-bit ASNs whose string representation can of course be longer than 5 bytes.  The len += snprintf()'s will return more bytes written than expected and then we'll hit our assert since we've written more bytes than originally allocated (str_size).  Have you tried reproducing it with an AS path containing 32-bit ASNs (of value at least  Regards, Jon Oberheide  --  Jon Oberheide <jon@...rheide.org> GnuPG Key: Fingerprint: DA66 6EDD  F47C 17FE  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
