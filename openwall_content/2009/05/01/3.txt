This typically affects the '/' directory, but could affect any directory on the system. This is all documented in the Ubuntu bug[1].  This was introduced in this commit:  and on Ubuntu are affected, but earlier versions are not. It looks like Debian never released with this code, and version (in Debian/unstable) is not affected. Derivatives of Ubuntu are presumably affected.  Can we get a CVE for this?
