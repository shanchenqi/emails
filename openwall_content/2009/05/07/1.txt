Pango suffers from a multiplicative integer overflow which may lead to a potentially exploitable, heap overflow depending on the calling conditions.  For example, this vulnerability is remotely reachable in Firefox by creating an overly large document.location value but only results in a process-terminating, allocation error (denial of service).  The affected function is pango_glyph_string_set_size. An overflow check when doubling the size neglects the overflow possible on the subsequent allocation:    string->glyphs = g_realloc (string->glyphs, string->space *                               sizeof (PangoGlyphInfo));  Note that other font rendering subsystems suffer from similar issues and should be cross-checked by maintainers.   Affected version:  Pango <   Fixed version:  Pango >= (check with your package maintainer for backports)   Credit: Will Drewry, oCERT Team | Google Security Team.
