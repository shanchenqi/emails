Johnson" <johnsonm@...th.com> To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: ptrace race CVE ID?  There's an exploit for the bug fixed in changeset floating around in the wild.  I had thought it was assigned a CVE ID, but I am having trouble finding a record of it.  Is anyone else aware of a CVE ID for it?  Thanks...
