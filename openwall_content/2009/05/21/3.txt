This is a different vector that isn't directly covered by that CVE, and may not have been fixed entirely when was fixed, so a new CVE can be considered.  However, we generally avoid including "defense-in-depth" fixes unless they can be demonstrated to be exploitable - or, if a vendor plans to release an advisory "just to be safe."  The changeset says "maybe not XSS exploitable though" so I'm not sure whether a CVE's needed yet.  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
