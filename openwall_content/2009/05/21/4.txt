Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: Re: CVE Request -- kdebase4 (konqueror) -- Incomplete  SSL Certificate support in KDE4   In CVE, we treat the inadvertent prevention of access to security functionality as a bug.  There is no direct way that an external attacker can trigger it, and the attacker gets no direct benefit by waiting for it to happen passively.  It's only doable by a person doing this to himself/herself.  So, this would not get a CVE.  - Steve    On Tue, 12 May Jan Lieskovsky wrote:  > Hello Steve, > >   not sure if original Debian bug [1] reporter meant this insufficiency, > but [2] might be interesting for your attention.
