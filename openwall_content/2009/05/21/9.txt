Reference: Reference: MLIST:[nfsv4] Status of execute permissions in NFSv4 ACLs ? Reference: Reference: MLIST:[nfsv4] [Patch] Re: Status of execute permissions in NFSv4 ACLs ? Reference: Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] CVE request: kernel: problem with NFS v4 client handling of MAY_EXEC in nfs_permission Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference:  The nfs_permission function in fs/nfs/dir.c in the NFS client implementation in the Linux kernel and earlier, when atomic_open is available, does not check execute (aka EXEC or MAY_EXEC) permission bits, which allows local users to bypass permissions and execute files, as demonstrated by files on an NFSv4 fileserver.
