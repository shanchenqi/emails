We don't have a CVE for the fact that strcpy() exists - it can be used safely even though it's dangerous.  My interpretation of this issue was the same, so no CVE is needed.  Any PHP application that misuses mb_ereg_replace(), however, is fair game.  (We already have a handful of CVEs for executable regexp's in PHP apps)  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
