I can't seem to find the fix in but I found the patch in the repository:  In http://xenbits.xensource.com, this tree is said to be the pre-release of the next 3.3 version of Xen (which doesn't sound right).  > ====================================================== > Name: > Status: Candidate > URL: > Reference: MLIST:[Xen-devel] [PATCH] hypervisor_callback adjustments > Reference: > Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] CVE Request: XEN local denial of service > Reference: >  > The hypervisor_callback function in Xen, possibly before as > applied to the Linux kernel and probably other > versions allows guest user applications to cause a denial of service > (kernel oops) of the guest OS by triggering a segmentation fault in > "certain address ranges."  This affects a x86 32-bit Xen guest. If a 32-bit application tried to access a memory location between the scrit and ecrit symbols in the kernel, instead of receiving a SEGV it could instead crash the kernel. This happens because of insufficient checking in the hypervisor_callback path, where it was forgetting to check the CS during entry.
