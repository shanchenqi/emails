Normally, Android applications will be allowed to share a uid if the packages are all signed by the same developer certificate and request permission to do so at install-time.  This allows for packages from the same author to share data.  Without enforcement of that behavior, it is possible for any application to be installed in such a manner that it gains access to another (existing) application's data.  A patch has been made available by Android (see references).   Affected version:  Android >= 1.5 CRB17 <= 1.5 CRB42   Fixed version:  Android >= 1.5 CRB43 (Android 1.0 and 1.1 are not affected)   Credit: Panasonic   CVE:   Timeline: Panasonic reported the issue to the Android Security Team Android Security Team requested assistance from oCERT oCERT requested CVE assignment CVE assigned advisory release   References:  Links: http://android.git.kernel.org http://android.com  Permalink:   -- Will Drewry <redpig@...rt.org> oCERT Team :: http://ocert.org  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
