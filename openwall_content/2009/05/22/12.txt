Debian collects information on all kernel security issues in a public SVN repo. It contains information on fixed versions, upstream commits and external information sources (e.g. other distribution bug trackers). It might be useful to you: http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/kernel-sec You can also subscribe to the SVN commit mailing list to get instant updates.  However, writing verbose advisories on all kernel security issues would be an Herculean task; we currently track kernel security issues in the kernel-sec tracker...
