During the package review of nilfs-utils packages before their inclusion into Fedora, it was pointed out that upstream Makefiles install files in /sbin as setuid root:   Apart from the fact that those utils most likely don't need to be setuid on normal installs, Steve Grubb also noticed that mkfs.nilfs2 executes external command using system(), making it easy to elevate privileges.  Issue should be fixed in released this Mon, with patches linked in the bug mentioned above.  From a quick look, this should not affect Debian / Ubuntu packages (thanks to dh_fixperms, it seems), Gentoo does not seem to have any stable version.  I've not looked at other distros.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
