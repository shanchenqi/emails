The input of several connector modules is not properly verified before being used, this leads to exposure of the contents of arbitrary directories on the server filesystem and allows file uploading to arbitrary locations. The affected code is remotely exposed before authentication. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to install remote shells on the victim server among other things, it should be noted that this vulnerability is being actively exploited in the wild.  Additionally several XSS vulnerabilities are present in the packaged samples directory.  A patch and a new FCKeditor version will be made available on Monday July 6th CET, this advisory will be updated with detailed information about the issue and a security patch.  In the meantime we strongly recommend to implement the following mitigation instructions:    * removed unused connectors from 'editor\filemanager\connectors'    * disable the file browser in config.ext    * inspect all fckeditor folders on the server for suspicious files that     may have been previously uploaded, as an example image directories     (eg. 'fckeditor/editor/images/...') are well known target locations     for remote php shells with extensions that match image files    * completely remove the '_samples' directory  Affected version:  FCKeditor <=  (version 3.0 is unaffected as it does not have any built-in file browser)  Fixed version:  FCKeditor >= (to be released on CET)  Credit: vulnerability report received from Vinny Guido <bigvin [at]         hushmail [dot] com>.
