This looks like even though there was a source code modification, the previous issue was not fixed at all.  That is, any attack that would have worked before the fix, will still work after the fix.  However, Fedora at least claims a fix for so a new CVE is probably in order to "signal" to admins that they have another issue to handle.  Use for the "new" issue.  What versions are affected by this?  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
