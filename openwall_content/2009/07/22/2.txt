This one will need to be split into two different ones, because:      a, the Bluetooth L2CAP and MIOP dissectors flaws are affecting only        version Wireshark (as mentioned in upstream's              b, but the RADIUS dissector issue affects also prior versions of        Wireshark -- issue / crash confirmed also in upstreams            Could you please split the into two CVE ids?   (one for the L2CAP, MIOP dissectors, other one for    the RADIUS).  Thanks && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team  P.S.: Affected Wireshark versions in other CVE identifiers       assigned within this update are sane.
