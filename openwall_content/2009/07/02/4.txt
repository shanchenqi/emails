The vulnerability is triggered by PNG image parsing, the read_png_file and read_png_file_as_rgb24 functions do not properly validate the width and height of the image. Specific PNG images with large width and height can be crafted to trigger the vulnerability.  Affected version:  CamlImages <= 2.2  Fixed version:  Unfortunately oCERT has been unable to get feedback from CamlImages maintainers and the package seems unmaintained, it's therefore suggested to avoid CamlImages usage on production or any environment where strong security is needed.
