I never implied it was "critical", yet it sounded "fairly important", and it still does, even if it only affects specific non-latest versions. When maintaining older distro releases / stable branches, distro vendors tend to back-port known security fixes, so even if an issue is no longer present in the latest version and even if older versions have other "equivalent" or "worse" vulnerabilities, that does not make your discovery unimportant.  In fact, this back-porting approach appears to be more common than updating a non-development release/branch to a new upstream version.  Thus, there may well be "latest" distro packages of older versions of Apache with all other known important security issues fixed.  Also, systems administrators may not be "blindly" updating to latest upstream releases - they may be relying on documentation of known important issues to decide when to upgrade.  > All in all, for now I wouldn't really make that much of an issue about it and I don't think that > the vendors need to hold off releasing anything if they have to.  OK, thanks for sharing your opinion.  I think the vendors will decide for themselves.  BTW, I wouldn't be too surprised if the problem turns out not to be an Apache bug, after all, but rather something specific to your system.  > Anyway, I had already mentioned > it in the lists some days earlier and for some reason that didn't attract any attention (perhaps because > I didn't use the word 0day there):  Yes, I am "guilty" of having missed that.

I suggest that you work with Apache security folks off-list to get the details figured out.  Since you did not reveal anything very specific yet (other than that a development version of Ncrack triggers the problem on a system of yours), it makes sense to possibly reduce the window of exposure by coming up with a fix before the bug is fully disclosed.
