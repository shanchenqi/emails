I have tried and reproduced it on some earlier versions (e.g Apache Thus I wouldn't really mark it as that critical yet, since up-to-date servers might not really be vulnerable. Right now only unpatched older versions (which have also other vulnerabilities anyway, according to the Apache 2.2 Changelog) probably do have a problem. However, this problem wasn't mentioned in the Changelong so if it indeed doesn't apply to the latest versions (which is yet to be defined), it might have been fixed "accidentally".  All in all, for now I wouldn't really make that much of an issue about it and I don't think that the vendors need to hold off releasing anything if they have to. Anyway, I had already mentioned it in the lists some days earlier and for some reason that didn't attract any attention (perhaps because I didn't use the word 0day there):  I am in the process of further investigating the issue, however. Let me know how this goes. Regards, ithilgore  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
