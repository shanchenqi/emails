Analysis: ACCURACY: some specifics were inferred from especially the debug statements that were added.  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT: says "Due to incorrect buffer limits and related bound checks Squid is vulnerable to a denial of service attack when processing specially crafted requests or responses."   ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Acknowledged: yes advisory Announced: Flaw: undiag Reference: Reference:  Squid 3.0 through and 3.1 through allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via malformed requests including (1) "missing or mismatched protocol identifier," (2) missing or negative status value," (3) "missing version," or (4) "missing or invalid status number," related to (a) HttpMsg.cc and (b) HttpReply.cc.
