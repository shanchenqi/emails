By the initial looks of things, it seems to be a fairly low severity issue and may not be easy to duplicate/trigger.  The reporter didn't really provide much in the way of a reproducer or relevant configs (and the reference to zope auths makes me not even want to touch it).  Has anyone taken a look at this or has a CVE been requested for it? Upstream has done nothing with this despite it being reported two weeks ago.
