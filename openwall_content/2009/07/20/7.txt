Beta.  It was a default RHEL 5.3 SELinux policy.  The same vulnerability from the policy exists in Fedora 10 and 11.  I haven't tested anything else, but I imagine lots more are vulnerable (and it doesn't matter what  kernel you're running).  There will be a CVE for this vulnerability as  well.  (Really there should have been a CVE for the lack of  -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks instead of pretending the only problem  was /dev/net/tun.  As the commit to add it showed (and at least 10 other  commits to the kernel this weekend) lots of other code was affected, so  someone not applying a fix for a CVE mentioning only /dev/net/tun  because they don't have the code for /dev/net/tun compiled in, is going  to be missing out on a number of fixes).  -Brad  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
