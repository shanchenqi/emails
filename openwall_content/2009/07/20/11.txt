Hey Alexander,  for a SUID-root binary, dropping privileges and giving control back to the user without going through exec to re-set the address space is probably not the best idea indeed. However I still believe this was a kernel issue, if you (really) know what you're doing (bzero-ing your secrets in the address space etc..), this should not be strictly forbidden. Without this patch, you could also disable address space layout randomization in SUID binaries, and in some cases exploit NULL ptr dereferences bugs in SUID-root binaries more easily. Granted, both would be non issues on a sane SUID binary, but this is what security in-depth is about. And being able to map a page in a SUID binary just feels wrong anyway :)  Cheers,  Julien  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
