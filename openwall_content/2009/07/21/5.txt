Users with a valid login are able to write files to all places to   which ZNC has write access. This means they could upload and load new   modules which do anything imaginable.  This bug is fixed in znc Update as soon as possible!    SVN log  ) says:  Fix a high-impact directory traversal bug You can upload files to znc via /dcc send *status. The files will be   saved in <datadir>/users/<user>/downloads/. The code for this didn't   do any checking on the file name at all and thus allowed directory   traversal attacks by all znc users (no admin privileges required!). By exploiting this bug, attackers could e.g. upload a new ssh   authorized_keys file or upload a znc module which lets everyone gain   shell access. Anything is possible. Again: ONLY A NORMAL USER ACCOUNT NEEDED, no admin privileges. THE   ATTACKER GOT WRITE ACCESS TO ALL PLACES ZNC GOT WRITE ACCESS TO.   So, obviously bad... would like a CVE for it.
