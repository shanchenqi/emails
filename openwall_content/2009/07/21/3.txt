Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Cc: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: CVE Request -- RubyGems  Hello Steve, vendors,    a potential system integrity violation flaw was found in the way RubyGems used to handle it's external Gem archives. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted Gem (POSIX tar) archive, which once opened by an unsuspecting user, would overwrite relevant system file.
