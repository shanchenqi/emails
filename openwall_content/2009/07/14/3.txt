XMLDsig is commonly | used by web services such as SOAP. The XMLDsig recommendation | includes support for HMAC truncation, as specified in When | HMAC truncation is under the control of an attacker, however, this | can result in an effective authentication bypass. For example, by | specifying an HMACOutputLength of 1, only one bit of the signature | is verified. This can allow an attacker to forge an XML signature | that will be accepted as valid.  What shall we do about this?  Shall we just cap the value at 80 or 96 bits in our implementations?
