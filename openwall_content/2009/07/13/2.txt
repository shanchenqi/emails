The libtiff package ships a library, for reading and writing TIFF, as well as a small collection of tools for manipulating TIFF images. The cvt_whole_image function used in the tiff2rgba tool and the tiffcvt function used in the rgb2ycbcr tool do not properly validate the width and height of the image. Specific TIFF images with large width and height can be crafted to trigger the vulnerability.  A patch has been made available by the maintainer and further improved by Tom Lane of Red Hat.  Affected version:  libtiff <= <= 3.9 (stable), <= 4.0 (development)  Fixed version:  libtiff, N/A (patch has been made available and it's expected to be committed to libtiff CVS)  Credit: vulnerability report and PoC code received from Tielei Wang <wangtielei         [at] icst [dot] pku [dot] edu [dot] cn>, ICST-ERCIS.
