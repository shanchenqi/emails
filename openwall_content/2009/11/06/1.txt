This advisory covers both buffer overflows and path traversal in the same data field.  While these may stem from "input validation" (as many issues do), we would typically assign two separate CVE names, since the fix for a buffer overflow would not necessarily fix the path traversal (or vice versa).  Unless there's some deeper reason for using a single CVE, I think we should assign separate CVEs here.  If you agree Mark, we can use for the overflow, and you could assign a new CVE for the traversal.  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
