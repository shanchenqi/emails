A new bind release is out there, it mentions:  "It addresses a potential cache poisoning vulnerability, in which data in the  additional section of a response could be cached without proper DNSSEC  validation."    [security]      When validating, track whether pending data was from                         the additional section or not and only return it if                         validates as secure. [RT   A CVE should probably be assigned.   --  Regards // Oden Eriksson Security team manager - Mandriva  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
