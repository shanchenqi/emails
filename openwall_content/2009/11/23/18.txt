The same core problem could be solved any number of ways, and I don't think that should distract from the fact that there is just one core problem.  So using the same CVE is appropriate.  (Now, if an interim fix is later found to have its own vulns or be bypassed in a way that was not originally advertised, that might need its own CVE.)  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
