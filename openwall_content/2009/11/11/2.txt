At most, it's a minor (?) information leak - one can see database and table names that he would not be able otherwise.  It is a problem - for example by a user demand we've added --skip-show-databases command-line switch which basically hijacks normal privilege checks and does not allow normal users to see the list of databases (without it one can see databases he has any privileges on). I mean, we've added this because users repeatedly requested it.  Still, I don't think it deserves a CVE ID on itself.   > The CREATE TABLE not fixing permissions if the file already exists is > probably closer to the real problem. Being able to do a select into an > outfile anywhere by default may also be an issue.  Not anywhere, it's done my mysqld daemon, as mysql user. Filesystem permissions still apply and limit where mysql user can write to. Also, SELECT ... OUTFILE never overwrite existing files. And in the default install only MySQL root user has FILE privilege necessary for SELECT ... OUTFILE.   > Also, Sergei, do you folks have a fix for this yet?

It's considered a relatively minor issue with a simple workaround (fix datadir permissions, use --secure-file-priv). On a properly configured system it should never be an issue - I was surprised to know that Debian creates these directories world-readable. And anyway this is limited to users with MySQL FILE privilege - and MySQL manual explicitly says that it's a powerful privilege that can be easily abused and should not be granted to just anybody.  We're fixing the permission problem. The desired behavior - after CREATE TABLE t1 all the files (t1.frm, t1.MYI, t1.MYD) have identical permissions, as if all the three were created anew. Even if some of these files existed before and had different permissions.
