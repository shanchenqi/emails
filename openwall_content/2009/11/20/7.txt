Bogdan Calin disclosed the details about that vulnerability on full-disclosure  mailing list. He didn't disclosed his script but I wrote a PoC that works like  a charm. It makes DoS possible for any server that runs PHP within 1 minute  with a few requests.  Additionally, this vulnerability affects I guess all products before  PHP are vulnerable.  I think this deserves CVE Id. Any ideas?  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
