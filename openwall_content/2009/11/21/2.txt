Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> CC: oss-security <oss-security@...ts.openwall.com>,         Sergei Golubchik <serg@...ql.com> Subject: CVE Request - MySQL -  Hi Josh, Steve, vendors,     MySQL upstream has released latest version of their Community Server, fixing one security issue:  Security Fix: MySQL clients linked against OpenSSL did not                check server certificates presented by a server linked against                yaSSL.  While the other two (three issues) looks too to be security relevant:  * Error handling was missing for SELECT statements containing    subqueries in the WHERE clause and that assigned a SELECT    result to a user variable. The server could crash as a result.     This looks to be from adjacent network exploitable mysqld DoS.  * If the first argument to GeomFromWKB() function was a geometry    value, the function just returned its value. However, it    failed to preserve the argument's null_value flag, which    caused an unexpected NULL value to be returned to the caller,    resulting in a server crash.     Same case as the above, though I can't look into upstream MySQL bugs to confirm or disprove it. Thus Cc-ed Sergei Golubchik on this mail.  * Failure to treat BIT values as unsigned could lead to    unpredictable results.    Also this one seems to be security related - upstream bug speaks about invalid memory access and didn't check the code if this could lead to heap overflow once the comparison fails.  Sergei, our opinion here is appreciated.
