Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> CC: oss-security <oss-security@...ts.openwall.com> Subject: CVE Request - Dovecot -  Hi Josh, Steve, vendors,     Dovecot upstream has released latest version, fixing one security issue. Quoting from news:  This is mainly to fix the base_dir creation issue, which could be considered a security hole, exploitable by local users. An attacker could for example replace Dovecot's auth socket and log in as other users. Gaining root privileges isn't possible though.  This affects only v1.2 users, v1.1 and older versions were creating the directory with permission.  References: ----------- http://www.dovecot.org/index.html  Could you allocate a CVE id? (in case there isn't one already).
