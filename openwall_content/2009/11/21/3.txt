No, looks safe. It reads one byte and thinks it's a bool:  class Field_num ... { ...    bool unsigned_flag;  while it's  somewhere in the middle of a pointer:  class Field_bit ... { ...    uchar *bit_ptr;  The worst that can happen - MySQL could think the value is signed (BIT values are always unsigned) and during the optimization phase won't notice that the condition like "unsigned_value > negative_number" is always true. Not a big deal.
