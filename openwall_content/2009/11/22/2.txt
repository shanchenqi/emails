This was previously disclosed and fixed in the 5.2.x tree. I believe this  is the same as  :     * Fixed a safe_mode bypass in tempnam(). :     * Fixed a open_basedir bypass in posix_mkfifo(). :     * Fixed bug (safe_mode_include_dir fails). :     * Fixed bug (popen crashes when an invalid mode is passed).  Also not flagged as 'security' up top, but from the changelog:  Fixed bug (proc_open() can bypass safe_mode_protected_env_vars  restrictions).
