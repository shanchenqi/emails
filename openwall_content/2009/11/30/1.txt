Because the symlink issues were not completely fixed in earlier versions, they get new CVE IDs for later versions.  (Downstream vendors might have fixed one issue, but not the other.)  The CVE is for an issue that technically was disclosed in  Let me know if we've missed anything.  - Steve  ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Reference: MLIST:[commits] bzr commit into mysql-6.0-backup branch Reference: Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] Re: Reference: Reference:  sql/sql_table.cc in MySQL 5.0.x through 5.1.x through and 6.0 before when the data home directory contains a symlink to a different filesystem, allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by calling CREATE TABLE with a (1) DATA DIRECTORY or (2) INDEX DIRECTORY argument referring to a subdirectory that requires following this symlink.   ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] CVE Request - MySQL - Reference: Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] Re: CVE Request - MySQL - Reference: Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] Re: CVE Request - MySQL - Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference:  mysqld in MySQL 5.0.x before and 5.1.x before does not (1) properly handle errors during execution of certain SELECT statements with subqueries, and does not (2) preserve certain null_value flags during execution of statements that use the GeomFromWKB function, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a crafted statement.   ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Reference: MLIST:[commits] bzr commit into mysql-4.1 branch Reference: Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] Reference: Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] CVE Request - MySQL - Reference: Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] Re: Reference: Reference: Reference: Reference:  The vio_verify_callback function in viosslfactories.c in MySQL 5.0.x before and 5.1.x before when OpenSSL is used, accepts a value of zero for the depth of certificates, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL-based MySQL servers via a crafted certificate, as demonstrated by a certificate presented by a server linked against the yaSSL library.   ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: Reference: MLIST:[commits] bzr commit into mysql-5.0-bugteam branch Reference: Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] Reference: Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] Re: Reference: Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] Re: Reference: Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] Re: Reference: Reference: Reference:  MySQL 5.1.x before allows local users to bypass certain privilege checks by calling CREATE TABLE on a MyISAM table with modified (1) DATA DIRECTORY or (2) INDEX DIRECTORY arguments that are originally associated with pathnames without symlinks, and that can point to tables created at a future time at which a pathname is modified to contain a symlink to a subdirectory of the MySQL data home directory, related to incorrect calculation of the mysql_unpacked_real_data_home value.
