The reported issues have been discovered in several API functions, issues include buffer overflows, near null reads/writes, arbitrary memory read and an off-by-one issue. Some of the issues have been previously reported in older versions of PHP but they either have not been fixed or they were re-introduced in a later time. The issues have been discovered in both core and, in some cases, PECL functions/classes/methods.  The following methods have been fixed.      ibase_pconnect     ibase_connect     com_print_typeinfo     popen     mssql_connect     mssql_pconnect     SplFileObject     DOMImplementation->createDocumentType     documentation()->public_id     SDO_DAS_ChangeSummary->beginLogging     SDO_DAS_Setting->getPropertyIndex     SDO_SequenceImpl->getProperty  The following methods have been removed in PHP 5.3, they are still available without fixes in      msql_close     msql_connect     msql_pconnect     msql_select_db     msql_list_tables  Affected version:  PHP <  Fixed version:  PHP >=  Credit: vulnerability report received from Emmanouel Kellinis, KPMG London.
