Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE request - kernel: NOMMU: Dont pass NULL pointers to fput() in  do_mmap_pgoff()   From upstream patch: "Don't pass NULL pointers to fput() in the error handling paths of the  NOMMU do_mmap_pgoff() as it can't handle it.  The following can be used as a test program: int main() { static long long * * 20] = { 0 }; return a;}  Without the patch, the code oopses in atomic_long_dec_and_test() as  called by fput() after the kernel complains that it can't allocate that  big a chunk of memory.  With the patch, the kernel just complains about  the allocation size and then the program segfaults during execve() as  execve() can't complete the allocation of all the new ELF program segments."   Doesn't affect if CONFIG_MMU=y.  Thanks, Eugene  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
