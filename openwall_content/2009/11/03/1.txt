Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: kernel: fs: pipe.c null pointer dereference  * a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in each of the following functions in the Linux kernel: pipe_read_open(), pipe_write_open(), and pipe_rdwr_open(). When the mutex lock is not held, the i_pipe pointer  could be released by other processes before it is used to update the  pipe's reader and writer counters. This could lead to a local denial of  service or privilege escalation.
