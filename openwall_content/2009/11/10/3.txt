Thoughts? >   That issue has a CVE id. I gave it quite some time ago.  The discussion then branched out into if an unchecked call to setuid to drop permissions is a security flaw (as a user could cause it to fail, preventing oping from dropping privs). I saw nothing in the code that showed it to be anything but a bug, as oping doesn't do anything exciting after the call could fail.  --      JB  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
