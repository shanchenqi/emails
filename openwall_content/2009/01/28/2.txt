This was a bit of a pain CVE-wise, though  I suspect it was less painful than what the maintainers are going through.  It seems fair to label the Python bug separately as an instance of Failure to Provide Specified Functionality (or some other "API Abuse problem).  Then we could assign separate CVE's for the others ("failure to work around a known issue in the underlying interpreter").  I'm always worried about these kinds of things producing mass amounts of CVE's, and it doesn't seem fair to those applications - but given that Python upstream can't/won't fix the issue, this seems the best approach, since the apps will have to be patched themselves.  Do you have any upstream bug ID's for the Python bug itself, or some Python mailing list?  I'd like to capture that issue there, if possible.  I'm using to help track the Python bug itself.  For the individual apps:  - Dia - Epiphany - Csound - eog  They all had CVE's because of James Vega's work in November, which was "technically public" at that time.  The following ones are because the first disclosure seems to be from Jan in the original oss-security post.  Does anybody have upstream version information for these?  They aren't in the Red Hat bug reports, so the descriptions have no versions.  - gedit - xchat - vim - Nautilus - Gnumeric   - Steve  ====================================================== Name:
