Your subject seems to claim that this vulnerability is fixed on the  Python side in 2.6 -- can you elaborate on that?  James Vega in the bug report you referenced [1] wrote: > This problem should be solved in 2.6 since absolute imports are the > default.

This is called an > absolute import.     So absolute imports do not fix situations where you (e.g.) "import re"  with CWD=/tmp in sys.path. Also, the test case shows that at least  Python PySys_SetArgv behaves the same: $ "" [''] ['', '/usr/lib64/portage/pym']  Regards, Robert  [1] [2]   Download attachment "signature.asc " of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
