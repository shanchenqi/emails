In default configuration, Firefox offers to open this file with the default application, which is xdg-open. Just one click on "OK" (and most users won't have a closer look at the dialog!) and the content in the .desktop file is immediately executed!  I guess that is what people get for reinventing "see", they get the exact same security problems other browser/"generic viewer" combinations had years ago....  And xdg-open had not even a way to specify the mime-type... </rant>  	Bernhard R.
