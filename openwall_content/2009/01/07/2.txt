This bug allows a malformed signature to be treated as a good signature rather than as an error. This issue affects the signature checks on DSA and ECDSA keys used with SSL/TLS.  The flaw may be exploited by a malicious server or a man-in-the-middle attack that presents a malformed SSL/TLS signature from a certificate chain to a vulnerable client, bypassing validation.  A patch fixing the issue with proper return code checking and further important recommendations are described in the original OpenSSL Team advisory.  At the request of the OpenSSL team, oCERT has aided in the remediation coordination for other projects with similar API misuse vulnerabilities. In addition to EVP_VerifyFinal, the return codes from DSA_verify and DSA_do_verify functions were being incorrectly validated, and packages doing so are affected in a similar fashion as OpenSSL.   Affected version:  OpenSSL <= [1]  The following packages were identified as affected by the same OpenSSL vulnerability, as they use OpenSSL EVP_VerifyFinal function and incorrectly check the return code.  NTP <= (production), <= (development)  Sun GridEngine <= 5.3  Gale <=  OpenEvidence <=  Belgian eID middleware - eidlib <= [2]  Freedom Network Server <= 2.x  The following packages were identified as affected by a vulnerability similar to the OpenSSL one, as they use OpenSSL DSA_verify function and incorrectly check the return code.  BIND <=  Lasso <=  ZXID <=  1 - use of OpenSSL as an SSL/TLS client when connecting to a server whose certificate uses an RSA key is NOT affected. Verification of client certificates by OpenSSL servers for any key type is NOT affected.  2 - Belgian eID middleware latest versions are not available in source form, therefore we cannot confirm if they are affected   Fixed version:  OpenSSL >=  NTP >= (production), >= (development)  Sun GridEngine >= 6.0  Gale N/A  OpenEvidence N/A  Belgian eID middleware - eidlib N/A  Freedom Network Server N/A  BIND >=  Lasso >=  ZXID N/A   Credit: Google Security Team (for the original OpenSSL issue).   CVE: (OpenSSL),         (NTP),         (BIND)   Timeline: OpenSSL Security Team requests coordination aid from oCERT oCERT investigates packages affected by similar issues contacted affected vendors investigation expanded to DSA verification BIND, Lasso and ZXID added to affected packages contacted additional affected vendors status updates and patch dissemination to affected vendors confirmation from BIND of issue and fix requested CVE assignment for BIND advisory published   References:   Links: http://openssl.org/ http://www.ntp.org/ http://gridengine.sunsource.net/ http://gale.org/ http://www.openevidence.org/ http://eid.belgium.be/ http://www.google.com/codesearch/p?#1vGzyQX--LU/achilles/remailer/zero-knowledge/freedomserver-2.x.tgz/ https://www.isc.org/products/BIND http://lasso.entrouvert.org/ http://www.zxid.org/   Permalink:   -- Will Drewry <redpig@...rt.org> oCERT Team :: http://ocert.org  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
