Wanted to provide more details about the affected versions for the gstreamer-plugins-good issues yet:  Original advisory:  The patch:  References:   Three problems: [A] heap buffer overflow vulnerability in QuickTime 'ctts' Atom parsing (vuln #1) [B] the array index out of bounds vulnerability QuickTime 'stss' Atom parsing (vuln #2) [C] heap buffer overflow vulnerability QuickTime 'stts' Atom parsing (vuln #3)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------  i, Vulnerability [A] and [B] affects gstreamer-plugins-good versions (CVE id#1):   <= x < (latest upstream)  CVE desc proposal: "A heap based buffer overflow in QuickTime 'ctts' Atom parsing and array index out of bounds vulnerability in QuickTimes Sync Sample Atom was found in gstreamer-plugins-good versions from through to  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ii, Vulnerability [C] affects gstreamer-plugins and gstreamer-plugins-good versions (CVE id#2)   <= x < (latest upstream)    CVE desc proposal: "A heap based buffer overflow in QuickTime Sync Sample Atom parsing has been found in gstreamer-plugins-good version from through to and in gstreamer-plugins version of   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  iii, Tomas Hoger discovered the similar vulnerability like the [B] one is present also in upstream code of gstreamer-plugins in version (CVE id#3)    CVE desc proposal "An array index out ouf bounds vulnerability has been found in gstreamer-plugins version of ..."  To be more exact on lines from to in (the relevant function is "gst_qtp_trak_handler"):              {               guint32 size = GUINT32_FROM_BE(stsz[sample]);               track_to_be->samples[sample].offset = offset;               track_to_be->samples[sample].size = size;               track_to_be->samples[sample].timestamp =               track_to_be->samples[sample].track = track_to_be;     g_tree_insert(qtdemux->samples,&(track_to_be->samples[sample].offset),&(track_to_be->samples[sample]));               offset += size;             }           }  There is also missing check if "sample" is still lower than "nsamples" and if write attempt to e.g. track_to_be->samples[sample].size = size; wouldn't overflow.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  More explanation about all the mystical QuicTime Atom names ('stts') can be found for example here:  http://developer.apple.com/DOCUMENTATION/QuickTime/QTFF/qtff.pdf (part Sample Table Atoms on page# 74).  Could you please allocate the 3 CVE ids for the above three cases?  Let me know, if I could be of any other help.
