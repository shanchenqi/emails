If the script is taking untrusted input data and passing it unsanitized  as the "key" argument to a dba_replace() call, it can override arbitrary  keys in the ini file anyway.  Truncating the ini file to zero length  seems like a less severe problem than being able to write (arbitrary?)  data to arbitrary keys.
