Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Cc: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: CVE Request -- openoffice.org  Hello Steve,    CVE of has been assigned to  the following WordPad Text Converter for Word 97 vulnerability:  The WordPad Text Converter for Word 97 files in Microsoft Windows SP4, XP SP2, and Server SP1 and SP2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted (1) .doc, (2) .wri, or (3) .rtf Word 97 file that triggers memory corruption, as exploited in the wild in December NOTE: As of it is unclear whether this vulnerability is related to a WordPad issue disclosed on with a example, but there are insufficient details to be sure.  With references:  Found out, this issue affects also the Word processor as shipped with OpenOffice.org.  Affected OpenOffice.org versions: <= x < Note: !! openoffice.org-2.* releases are not affected by this issue !!  What's the strategy in this case -- will we need a new id for this issue && the openoffice.org1 case? (And if so, could you allocate one?)
