Please note that this describes  the software used in debian as mod-auth-mysql (binary name is  libapache2-mod-auth-mysql). It is different from the SF project.  Package        : mod-auth-mysql Vulnerability  : SQL injection vulnerability Problem type   : remote Debian-specific: no CVE Id         :   Martin Joey Schulze discovered that mod-auth-mysq, an apache 2 module for mysql authentication, is prone to an SQL injection due to insufficient escaping mechanisms, when multybite character encodings are used.  The link[0] points to the patch. Please credit Martin Joey Schulze for writing  it.
