Thanks.  ----- Forwarded Message -----  Hello,  as I've seen, you also seem to use xdg-open in /etc/mailcap.  The problem is, that xdg-open, itself, detects the right mime-type. This allowes an attacker to deliver a dangerous file with a trustworthy mime-type to get it executed by xdg-open.  I've created an example page: https://prefbar.mozdev.org/testxdgopen.html (With SSL) http://prefbar.mozdev.org/testxdgopen.html (Without SSL)  This page delivers a .desktop file with the mime-type "application/pdf". In default configuration, Firefox offers to open this file with the default application, which is xdg-open. Just one click on "OK" (and most users won't have a closer look at the dialog!) and the content in the .desktop file is immediately executed!  Other combinations are possible, I just got the first result with .desktop files. There may be other dangerous types, Firefox may be tricked to open with xdg-open. It's even possible to hide the real file type.
