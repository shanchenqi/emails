Recommending other distros to behave in similar way.    2,   > Do you have any upstream bug ID's for the Python bug itself, or some > Python mailing list?

Current RH status can be seen here:  and here: and here:  For testing purposes it is possible to use Ray Strode's test case from:   The Python upstream bug report will follow as soon as we will find a patch, which would resolve also the 'sub-modules, which are in more than a one file' ('import utils' example) case.  3, The original description will need modification. Robert is right, this issue is still present also in Python 2.6 (even absolute imports didn't resolve it). For more details please proceed to:  and to:  So please update the text of to state:  "... in Python prepends an empty string to sys.path ...".
