Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Cc: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: CVE request -- Python < 2.6 PySys_SetArgv issues (epiphany, 	csound, dia, eog, gedit, xchat, vim, nautilus-python, Gnumeric)  Hello Steve,    initially has been assigned for the Blender's  untrusted search path issue.  Though this is a Python flaw (insertion of cwd at the beginning of the Python modules search path), according to our Python maintainers it can't be fixed on Python's side due the need of ensuring the work of other numerous packages, when loading Python modules.   Similar flaw, like the Blender one, has been discovered in the following packages:  1, epiphany References:  (test case,  mention about other affected packages, Python upstream bug rejection reasons) Debian patch:  2, csound References: Debian patch:   3, dia References: Debian patch:   4, eog References: Debian patch:  5, gedit References:  6, xchat References:  7, vim References:  8, nautilus-python References:  9, Gnumeric References:   Steve, could you please allocate a new CVE ids for the above issues?
