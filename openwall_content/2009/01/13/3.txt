This issue only affects netatalk installations that make use  of a pipe command to handle the print file and also use one  of the available variables in the piped command.  The netatalk documentation documents %F, %U and %J while  there is also %C which is undocumented but visible in the  code (and does the same as %J).  These variables are expanded, %F with the content of %%From:, %J with  %%Title: from the PostScript stream and %U with the user  printing the file.  After the variable expansion (which is done in  pipexlate(lp.c) the specified,expanded command is passed to  popen() without properly escaping it before.  So exploiting this is pretty straight forward if you know  the papd configuration (which is at least world-readable on  Debian) just by for example preparing a ps file including  something like %%Title: $(yourcommand) and print it.  Steve, can you update the CVE id description according to  this information?  Cheers Nico P.S.
