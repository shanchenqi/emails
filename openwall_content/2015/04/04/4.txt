Our understanding so far is that the underlying problem is that the original design didn't fully consider the ability of an attacker to rename. Because of this, the rename implementation has been changed so that it detects a violation of the intended security properties and puts a countermeasure in place. This has been done in the fs/dcache.c __d_move function. There is no commit available yet at    http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/fs/dcache.c  Use for this issue.  As far as we can tell, the patches don't address a separate scenario in which a ".." attack can occur but the underlying problem is something other than rename handling. So, we don't think a second CVE ID is needed.  (For purposes of CVE, a set of "possible to escape from bind mounts" discoveries could have multiple IDs if the root cause of one issue were the acceptability of the ".." syntax in a certain context, and the root cause of another issue were unrelated to this.)  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =vO4b -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
