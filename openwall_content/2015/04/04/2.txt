There is apparently no commit available yet at:    http://cgit.freedesktop.org/NetworkManager/NetworkManager/log/src/rdisc/nm-lndp-rdisc.c  but, again, we don't know whether changes would need to occur there.  Use for the NetworkManager vulnerability.   Also, note that     refers to affected closed-source products. (CVE IDs for closed-source products would be announced elsewhere.) It also refers to Android. We don't know whether Android was listed only because of a shared-codebase issue, e.g.,     (there is no commit at currently)  or whether Android is affected in other ways. Unless there is incorrect hop_limit processing in code that is specific to Android, Android would not have a unique CVE ID.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =qiwd -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
