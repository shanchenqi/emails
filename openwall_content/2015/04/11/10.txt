In order to ensure full traceability, we need a CVE number assigned that we can attach to further notifications. This issue is already public.  Title: Read-only directory traversal in Etherpad frontend tests Reporter: Tom Hunkapiller Versions: through  Description: Tom Hunkapiller reported a vulnerability in the frontend tests of previous Etherpad releases, which are enabled by default. Parent directory references were not correctly sanitized in frontend test URLs of HTTP API calls, allowing an attacker to remotely read arbitrary files on the server's filesystem with the privileges of the account running the service.  Notes: This bug was introduced in commit ba4ebbb which was initially included in the release, and is fixed in commit which appears in the release.
