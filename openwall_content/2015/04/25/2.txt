According to XML::LibXML's documentation it should be possible to disable processing of external entities by using the "expand_entities" parameter.  Two example scripts are attached to this mail. The  output of XEE-XML-LibXML-demo.pl should not contain external  entities, but "expand_entities" is ignored. The output  of XEE-XML-LibXML-demo2.pl is as expected (no external entities).  The behaviour depends on how the XML is loaded. Using "$XML_DOC = XML::LibXML->load_xml" works as documented, using  $parser = XML::LibXML->new and $XML_DOC = $parser->load_xml does not.  I've tested the issue on two platforms and was able to print out the  system's "/etc/passwd" file.   Ubuntu LTS Perl version: libxml2 version: XML::LibXML version:  Mac OS X Perl version: libxml2 version: XML::LibXML version:   The vulnerability is fixed in version I'm not sure which older versions are affected, however the vulnerability is present in version and probably older versions, too.  The fix:  Changelog:  I'm not aware of other CVE requests.
