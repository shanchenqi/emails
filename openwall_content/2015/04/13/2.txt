It seems conceivable that also fixed something else, e.g.,    1. Maybe the      "-     add_action( 'wp_ajax_nopriv_fsb_save_order', array( $this, 'save_order' ) );"       code change means that wp_ajax_nopriv_fsb_save_order allowed      bypassing intended access control, even if the attacker did not      supply an XSS payload.    2. Maybe the patched code can help to prevent a CSRF attack against      an authenticated action handler.  If so, then additional CVE IDs would be needed.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =yUNM -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
