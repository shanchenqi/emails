A possible attack scenario against a VPN server running xl2tpd   follows.    xl2tpd starts a new pppd process for each connection attempt. A remote   attacker could repeatedly connect to the remote server, even with   invalid credentials, in order to increase the pid of pppd at every   attempt. After pppd's pid reaches each and every subsequent   connection attempt would fail, resulting in a denial of service.
