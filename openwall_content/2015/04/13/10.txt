Certainly the CSRF will have its own CVE ID, because it is independent of whether (and why) wp_ajax_nopriv_fsb_save_order existed.  In this specific case, for the direct unauthenticated attacks, we feel that there can be two CVE IDs for the two different problems with different types of attacks, i.e., leaving the services in their original order but including an XSS payload and moving the services to an arbitrary order but omitting an XSS payload. These conceivably could have been (even though they weren't) fixed independently:    add an effective approach against XSS in the input data, but   ignore the relationship between the new order values and the   original order values    versus    ensure that the order values, when compared numerically, have no   change from the original values -- but ignore trailing   non-numeric data  We will send the additional CVE IDs soon unless there is any new information.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =DRJz -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
