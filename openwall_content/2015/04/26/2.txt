This is a critical security release > for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your > sites immediately. >  > WordPress versions and earlier are affected by a critical cross- > site scripting vulnerability, which could enable anonymous users to > compromise a site. This was reported by Cedric Van Bockhaven and fixed > by Gary Pendergast, Mike Adams, and Andrew Nacin of the WordPress > security team. >  > We also fixed three other security issues: >  >  * In WordPress 4.1 and higher, files with invalid or unsafe names >    could be uploaded. Discovered by Michael Kapfer and Sebastian >    Kraemer of HSASec. >  * In WordPress 3.9 and higher, a very limited cross-site scripting >    vulnerability could be used as part of a social engineering attack. >    Discovered by Jakub Zoczek. >  * Some plugins were vulnerable to an SQL injection vulnerability. >    Discovered by Ben Bidner of the WordPress security team. >  > We also made four hardening changes, discovered by J.D. Grimes, Divyesh > Prajapati, Allan Collins, Marc-Alexandre Montpas and Jeff Bowen. >  > We appreciated the responsible disclosure of these issues directly to > our security team. For more information, see the release notes or > consult the list of changes.  Could you please assign CVEs to identify the issues fixed by the latest WordPress release?
