Due to the fact that TelescopeJS is an expressjs web application, it uses the model of storing session information in the browsers localStorage.  This means that if an attacker is able to find a single cross-site scripting flaw in MeteorJS, they would then be able to extract the users password hash from incoming websocket messages. This hash could then be cracked.  The bcrypt hash is sent in incoming websocket messages every time the user object is needed by the application.  This vulnerability affects TelescopeJS installations below version  A discussion about these issues can be found here:  The commits leading to the fix for this flaw can be found here:   If any more details are required, please let me know.
