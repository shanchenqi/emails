An example where this is triggered is if the server is configured to not allow SSLv3 connections and a client tries to connect with SSLv3 only.  The reason is that the error handling routine will try to finish the handshake and that will crash. Details here:  I had created a patch, one of the dovecot devs created a more thorough patch that will probably catch more error states properly: http://dovecot.org/tmp/diff (url likely not stable) Nothing is applied yet I think.  I think this deserves a CVE.   There is a related issue in openssl: It will crash instead of throwing an error if one tries to use a connection context that already failed.
