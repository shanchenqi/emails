Peter Anvin, on LKML ( see )  To quote:  "When we write entropy into a non-empty pool, we currently don't account at all for the fact that we will probabilistically overwrite some of the entropy in that pool.  This means that unless the pool is fully empty, we are currently *guaranteed* to overestimate the amount of entropy in the pool!"  The impact of this issue could be to a downgrade the kernels true RNG to a pseudo-RNG.
