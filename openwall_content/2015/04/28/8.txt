I think the issues here are vulnerabilities in plugins.  Sources: https://scrutinizer-ci.com/blog/php-security-analysis-finds-xss-vulnerability-in-popular-wordpress-plugins https://yoast.com/coordinated-security-release/  The sucuri blog post lists a whole number of affected plugins. Maybe at least the more popular ones (jetpack, wordpress seo, google analytics by yoast, all in one seo) should get their own CVEs.  --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
