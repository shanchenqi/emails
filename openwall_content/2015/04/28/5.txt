It turns out one of the addresses was in the form "user@...ain.tld/random", not sure how that snuck in but anyways. When sending email to this list it fails due to that address being present:  from mailman posts log:  Apr 28 post to testing from testing-request@XXX, 1 failures  from smtp-failure log:  smtp-failure:Apr 28 All recipients refused: {'kurt@...fried.org/foo': Bad recipient address syntax')}, msgid:  So obviously any list configured to require confirmation will not be affected by this, but lists using import via file or web interface could potentially be affected (if you get a "dirty" list), or lists that are require admin approval only and not confirmation (e.g. the admin doesn't notice it when they hit accept).  Overall I don't think this is a security vulnerability, if you have "require confirmation" and clean any address prior to import it cannot be triggered, but it would be nice to have this hardened I think.   --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
