The CVE mapping is:  > a single > vulnerability affecting both node and URONode in which a client could > use "quit" within telnet, and thereby cause the server to waste > network bandwidth on a radio path  Use The known affected version of node (aka LinuxNode) is (for Debian, the "ax25-node" package name is associated with the "node" source-package name). Within the URONode changelog, the relevant entry is apparently ... I added a quit_handler routine in the main loop which now will execute a node_logout(), flush out the IPCs, log the event to syslog, and close out the application properly."   > app fails to close and more can be spawned by a crafty malicious > user thus bringing the system to a point of no memory available.  This does not have a CVE ID. The node software was not attempting to defend against a scenario in which a single client user causes arbitrarily many node processes to run on the server simultaneously. The node software runs as a service under inetd (or a similar program), and any related restrictions would ordinarily be part of the inetd configuration. Lack of restrictions is a site-specific problem.  ("crafty malicious user" means, for example: if a client were allowed to have simultaneous node processes, the malicious user could choose a request timing that ensured that processes were always running.)  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =Jv34 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
