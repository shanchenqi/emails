Typically a CVE ID is not assigned for an issue that the software's author describes as an "improvement." In each case, the "bit less vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks" is apparently a tradeoff against something else, such as robustness during times when no flooding attack is underway. In the first case, possibly a legitimate client cannot make use of the first INTRODUCE1 cell and therefore sends another one intentionally. In the second case, maybe the rendezvous circuits are failing because of physical problems with the network, and more reattempts would have been helpful.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =HH4n -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
