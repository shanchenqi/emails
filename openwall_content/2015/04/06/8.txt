Instead, it was intended to mean:    We are not disputing that the patches are adequate. Also, in our   current understanding, all attack scenarios ultimately depend on the   previously incorrect handling of renames. Because there isn't a   second type of scenario, there isn't a second CVE ID.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =HorD -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
