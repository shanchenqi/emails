Could you assign CVE identifiers for those? (I guess the first and second might deserve one? Not sure about the third and last item):  > Changes in version - >   Tor fixes two security issues that could be used by an >   attacker to crash hidden services, or crash clients visiting hidden >   services. Hidden services should upgrade as soon as possible; clients >   should upgrade whenever packages become available. >  >   This release also contains two simple improvements to make hidden >   services a bit less vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks. >  >   o Major bugfixes (security, hidden service): >     - Fix an issue that would allow a malicious client to trigger an >       assertion failure and halt a hidden service. Fixes bug >       bugfix on Reported by "disgleirio".   >     - Fix a bug that could cause a client to crash with an assertion >       failure when parsing a malformed hidden service descriptor. Fixes >       bug bugfix on Found by "DonnchaC".  >  >   o Minor features (DoS-resistance, hidden service): >     - Introduction points no longer allow multiple INTRODUCE1 cells to >       arrive on the same circuit. This should make it more expensive for >       attackers to overwhelm hidden services with introductions. >       Resolves ticket   >     - Decrease the amount of reattempts that a hidden service performs >       when its rendezvous circuits fail. This reduces the computational >       cost for running a hidden service under heavy load. Resolves >       ticket   Regards, Salvatore  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
