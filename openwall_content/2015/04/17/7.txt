This is a new scenario for pool cleanup, applicable during interaction with Apache HTTP Server 2.4.x versions (interaction with Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x versions had been working successfully).  The existence of this CVE does not mean that the sapi/apache2handler/sapi_apache2.c code was "at fault" -- it only means that, in practice, this sapi_apache2.c code wasn't compatible with the 2.4.x behavior and therefore has now been changed.  The scope of this CVE does not include any other security implications of the described behavior change between 2.2.x and 2.4.x: 'Apache 2.4 "broke" its API in the sense that the r->pool cleanup now happens asynchronously with request processing - sending of reply data to the client runs in parallel with processing the next request (of a HTTP/1.1 pipelined connection, at least).'  The scope of this CVE does not include any security implications of the described behavior of the "virtual" function in the post, e.g., "the ap_rflush() in zif_virtual() terminates the currently running main request, in my testing, resulting in a completely crashing apache."  Finally, the scope of this CVE does not, of course, include any additional issue (if one exists) that was mentioned only in and not mentioned in  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =EOa/ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
