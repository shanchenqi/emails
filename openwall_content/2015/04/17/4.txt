A PoC was also produced and is public.  Patches are now available and proposed to Linus[2].  This may not simply be information disclosure, but containerized environments may through chroot and mount namespaces mask directory structures as read-only or inaccessible via the use of bind-mounts. Such read-only masking may be circumvented by this vulnerability on systems where these directories are not otherwise protected by MAC (i.e. SELinux or AppArmor).
