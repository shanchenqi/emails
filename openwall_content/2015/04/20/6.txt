There's no doubt that there was an interesting bug found (i.e., the "rewind into previous inline" bug) and that the bug had a real-world impact on some Redcarpet users. However, that's not necessarily enough to have a CVE ID.  One issue in question is "in the meantime we've hardened our HTML postprocessor, which also eliminates this bug" in the post. This is perhaps similar to what was mentioned about remarkable in the post.  Basically, we're not convinced that anyone should have been relying on Redcarpet as having the security property that it would prevent XSS attacks. In that sense, the "rewind into previous inline" bug would not be categorized as a vulnerability. Apparently hackerone.com had an unspecified HTML postprocessor that might be interpreted as having either some responsibility or all responsibility for preventing XSS attacks. Similarly, in the case of a PHP-based site elsewhere, the overall site design might include both a Markdown implementation and also HTML Purifier. Also, https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md didn't announce as a security update. We realize that Redcarpet has a :filter_html flag, but the level of focus toward addressing XSS seems small compared to something like HTML Purifier, suggesting different design goals.  So, at this point, the available information suggests categorizing as a site-specific problem on hackerone.com and on other sites that were relying on Redcarpet in ways that went beyond the Redcarpet design goals. If there is other information suggesting that the only reasonable interpretation is that it is a Redcarpet vulnerability that must have a CVE assigned against the Sundown/Redcarpet codebase, please let us know.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =nvFY -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
