The closed-source bits leftover from Oracle will never be updated, because Oracle unceremoniously closed the old OpenSolaris project without even telling the community (the  community found out via a leaked internal email).  Illumos is its own entity, and we'd only be asking for CVE entries based on what is open-sourced, modulo some really REALLY bizarre corner-case I can't imagine, but whose (remote) possibility I won't dismiss.  There is always a chance that illumos has some problem that ALSO exists in now-closed Oracle Solaris (or perhaps in still open-sourced components that are common to both), but please do not equate the two as a rule of thumb.
