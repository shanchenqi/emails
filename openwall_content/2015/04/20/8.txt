However, because there's additional information in that's not discussed in your message, we don't know whether one or two CVE IDs is the correct number.  If each of the two observations of "default error is negative one. However, callers are expecting errnos or zero." and "we're supposed to be checking the alignment of two different offsets, pfr_loff and pfr_ioff, but end up checking pfr_loff twice" could be independently exploitable, then there will be two CVE IDs. If only one is exploitable, or if exploitation requires both, then there will be one CVE ID.  The cve-assign@...re.org address can be used for non-public requests for illumos CVEs. There may be other options for the open-source parts, but we think that not all of illumos is open source. http://wiki.illumos.org/display/illumos/illumos+FAQs says "There still remain some binary-only, closed source components that we inherited from Oracle." If the component also affects an Oracle product, then Oracle could assign the CVE ID.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =d2+H -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
