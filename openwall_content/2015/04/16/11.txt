When a comment was defined on the same line that contained an "Allow" directive, any potential IP ranges in that comment were also allowed to access a resource.  This flaw was fixed in:   The docs do specify that comments are not allowed on the same line:  "There must be no other characters or white space between the backslash and the end of the line." [https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/configuring.html#syntax]  MITRE, does this qualify for a CVE?   Reproducer:  $ sudo yum -y install httpd  $ echo | sudo tee /var/www/html/secret.txt  $ echo '<Location "/secret.txt"> > Order allow,deny > Allow from # not 10 > </Location>' | sudo tee -a /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf sudo service httpd restart  client on 10.x.x.x: $ HEAD servername.com/secret.txt OK  The security implications of this flaw were discovered by Espen Fjellvaer Olsen from Basefarm AS.  --  Martin PrpiÄ / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
