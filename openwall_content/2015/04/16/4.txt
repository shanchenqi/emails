The specific exploitation scenario disclosed in raceabrt.c is about replacing maps with a symlink to /etc/passwd and then waiting for the next line of the code to chown /etc/passwd. This requires symlink following, and will have the same CVE ID as other issues that require symlink following.  If the only goal of an attacker were to delete the maps file in order to cause data loss, then we think that attacker does not need to win a race. That attacker can delete the maps file either before or after the chown. (It's also conceivable that file deletion, by itself, was considered an acceptable risk, and not a valid attack goal.)  However, the text of said "is vulnerable to a filesystem race where a user unlinks the file." That's why we asked about the possibility of another scenario in which:    1. The ultimate goal is only to unlink the file.   2. Achieving this ultimate goal requires winning a race.  We think there's isn't any such scenario, but we wanted to confirm that before doing a CVE mapping. If there isn't any such scenario, then the total number of CVE IDs for the whole "Furthermore, Abrt suffers" section will be 1.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =h2Xd -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
