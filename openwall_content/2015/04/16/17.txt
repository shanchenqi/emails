MITRE doesn't have any role in establishing the policies for use of the oss-security list. The types of information you sent earlier -- references with vague changelog entries "Fixed for SQL injection vulnerabilities" and "Fix SQL injection vulnerabilities" -- are normally considered valid reports of open-source vulnerabilities, e.g., a person who is neither the discoverer nor the vendor might notice such a changelog entry and send it here. However, it is somewhat unusual for a discoverer to choose a multi-stage approach in which that level of a vague information is provided in one oss-security post and full details are sent in a later post.  Our only suggestion for this case is that, given that the multi-stage approach is already in progress, it would probably be best to establish a link in at least one direction, e.g., either:    - your full advisory should include a link to         so that this previous discussion can be found    or    - you should make a later oss-security post in this thread, with a     link to the public URL(s) for your full advisory, which might     be in any of the four locations that you proposed  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =5gid -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
