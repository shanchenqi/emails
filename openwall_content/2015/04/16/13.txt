We feel that we may not have definitive information about whether that SQL injection was ever fixed. The > page no longer exists with its content, but had previously only mentioned fixing XSS, not fixing SQL injection.  Hi,  it's definitely a different vulnerability, as regards a SQL injection vulnerability in ajax/mail_functions.php whereas the problem I discovered exists in a forum function. I received the following notification from the plugin author:  > From: Simon (WPS) [mailto:simon@...ymposium.com]  > Sent: Wednesday, 15. April > To: Hannes Trunde > Subject: Re: AW: SQL Injection Vulnerability in WP Symposium > > Thanks Hannes, I've implemented the fix in the code and will be looking to get it uploaded to the WordPress repo later today. > > Kind regards > Simon  I will post the changelog link and details of the vulnerability as soon as the plugin page is online again.  By the way - what would be the best way to publish the vulnerability details? A reply to this thread or posting it to Exploit-DB, Packet Storm or other mailing lists like Fulldisc or Bugtraq? Any best practices?
