The documentation says:     Lines that begin with the hash character "#" are considered    comments, and are ignored. Comments may not be included on the same    line as a configuration directive.  > MITRE, does this qualify for a CVE?  We can't make that decision without knowing the perspective of the upstream vendor. Because the upstream vendor has a process for assigning CVE IDs, we feel it would be simplest and best here to use that process, even if it is often not used in cases of publicly known vulnerabilities. See the security@...che.org address on the http://www.apache.org/security/committers.html page. It's their decision on how to proceed; possibilities include:    - no CVE because the behavior with a # character is undefined    - a single CVE for both because they intended "Comments may not be     included" to only mean that a syntax error would be reported    - a CVE only for mod_authz_host because they had actually wanted to     support # comments for that one  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =Wu5Y -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
