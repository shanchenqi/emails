Yes. We are actually using the archive URLs under http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security within our internal tracking, so we are aware of the messages that were successfully entered in that archive. If there are new vulnerability reports that are related to a previous message, then mentioning an archive URL in that format (rather than, for example, the http://seclists.org/oss-sec format) would make it easiest for us to find the previous context.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =zHq3 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
