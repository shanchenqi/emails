OK, use for all of the Symlink Following vulnerabilities disclosed in either the main body of or the raceabrt.c attachment. (The attachment is visible in other archives such as the one.)  The scope of and is limited to what is stated in the post.   >> If an unprivileged user can cause the maps file to be missing, then >> that's a (minor) denial of service.  > If the only goal of an attacker were to delete the maps file in order > to cause data loss, then we think that attacker does not need to win a > race.

This currently has no CVE ID because we aren't sure that ABRT has a design goal of preventing a user from interfering with crash data collection. The ABRT documentation mentions     MaxCrashReportsSize = <size_in_megabytes>     This option sets the amount of storage space, in megabytes,    used by ABRT to store all problem information from all users.    The default setting is MB. Once the quota specified here    has been met, ABRT will continue catching problems, and in    order to make room for the new crash dumps, it will delete    the oldest and largest ones.  In other words, if a user did not want one of their application crashes to be properly reported, they could apparently trigger many more crashes of a different application, and thereby cause the first crash's data to be permanently lost. The user would have no specific need to rely on standard filesystem access (e.g., rm), or unlink calls in special-purpose C code, to cause this data loss.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =dirs -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
