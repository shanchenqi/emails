Our intension is to do  more for security. Security for embedded customers has not been a high prio in the  past since most of these devices are isolated, not connected to the outside world. This is however changing and thus security is becoming important. To become a member in the Linux-distros list is not the only security concern for us,  this is one of the items on our list.  This is a sign that we care about security, and we  want to be part of this community, to contribute back to this community as much as we can and also get help and inspiration to improve.    > > If downloading patches and applying them by hand is really the > > distribution model Enea has chosen, then it feels like the provenance > > of updates is seriously lacking.  Patches to our customers are handled differently, basically the way each of our customers require. The publically available patches are primarily for non-customer Enea Linux users, but still we should provide security updates in a secure way. Please note that Enea Linux is used in the embedded systems, so our customers don't want every day (binary/source code) patches. Some embedded devices are not easy to update. Instead we often deliver e.g. monthly updates or when the customer desires the update.   > > In my opinion, until some more of the security basics are covered, > > joining linux-distros@ is premature. >  > I guess Ubuntu has to be dropped from the linux-distros then, because > www.ubuntu.com appears to be http-only and the ISO download is entirely > insecure.
