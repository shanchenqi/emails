This can leak data across users, VMs and survives reboots.  I'd say these are vulnerabilities in the graphics drivers. It is to be expected that on a multi user system data is not leaked from one account to another (however there are other situations where this also happens, e.g. the fact that on vanilla linux users can see other users processes). A device driver should not leak data across users.  (and yes, I know this is not new and has been pointed out before - even more reason to fix it)  Redhat bug:  Haven't found any infos on fixes yet. I think people of affected GPUs (mine isn't) should report these issues as security vulnerabilities to their graphics driver developers.  cu, --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
