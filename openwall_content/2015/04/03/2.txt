I guess Ubuntu has to be dropped from the linux-distros then, because www.ubuntu.com appears to be http-only and the ISO download is entirely insecure. The security notices are also served insecurely there:  http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/  Am I missing something... ? It doesn't make much sense to criticize this when you folks are doing the same. I do get the impression that Enea Linux is handling security poorly (where are all of the other issues?) but this bothered me.
