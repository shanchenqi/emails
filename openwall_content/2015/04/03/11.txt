Ubuntu ISO downloads come alongside signed files:  Granted, determining if the hashes was signed by a legitimate key is difficult to bootstrap, and our website currently doesn't help. As a result of Kurt's recent discussion about Kali Linux, and simultaneous prompting by Douglass Clem, I have asked our web team to make the ISO signing keys more prominently available on our website than just mentioned on one wiki page.  > The security notices are also served insecurely there: >  > http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/  The security advisories we send via email are gpg signed: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-security-announce/  In addition, the mechanism we suggest our users should use to apply updates -- apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade, or the graphical equivalent -- provides for full trust path validation automatically. The advisories are simply additional information for the curious. Our users can freely ignore our mailed and posted advisories if they wish.  I raised my concerns about Enea's advisories largely because it appeared that their recommended mechanism of acquiring and installing updates is entirely unvalidated from end to end. If they are also using an authenticated tool like up2date, yum, apt-get, apt-rpm, zypper, pacman, pkgsrc, or git with signed tags or otherwise authenticated tags, as the actual mechanism users should use to download updates, then they should recommend using that tool in their advisories.  > Am I missing something... ?

Funny, I didn't worry too much about how fee issues they've addressed: I don't know what packages they ship, nor the threat models their users may have with their systems.  Please don't hesitate to share any other concerns with Ubuntu's security practices.
