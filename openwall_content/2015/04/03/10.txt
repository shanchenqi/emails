Learmonth" <irl@...e.org> To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: Request CVE for LinuxNode - DoS vulnerability  Hi,  I'm a member of the Debian Hamradio Maintainer's team and a denial-of-service bug has been reported on our package ax25-node. (Debian bug: I would like to request a CVE for this vulnerability.  The software in this package is identified as LinuxNode in the README contained in the source package. The author is identified as Tomi Manninen OH2BNS, <tomi.manninen@....fi> although attempts have been made to contact the author and have been unsuccessful, as mentioned in the Debian bug report.   From the bug report:  "The SIGQUIT routine fails to close the app leaving the IP sockets open and in some cases DDOS the remote site if a user "ctrl-]+q" out of a telnet session.

Brian N1URO on the bug report maintains a replacement node package and I am confident that his report is accurate. He found this vulnerability in but due to an unresponsive upstream this got lost. This is the first request for a CVE for this vulnerability.  This appears to be an issue affecting multiple versions, although I can only say that it is present in  I am happy to provide more information if needed and I can be contacted at:    irl@...e.org  Thanks, Iain.  --  e: irl@...e.org            w: iain.learmonth.me x: irl@...ber.fsfe.org     t: EPVPN c: 2M0STB                  g: IO87we p: 5FF2 CCD5 56FF 9EA4  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
