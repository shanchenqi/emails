A CVE was issued from Debian, but the commit is public in the upstream repo, so this mail is to avoid deduplication of this issue.  Sorry about this mishandling,  Thanks,   Paul  --  #define sizeof(x) rand() </paul> :wq  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
