As a result, a buffer overflow can occur in the implementation of functions such as gethostbyname_r, and crafted DNS responses might cause application crashes or result in arbitrary code execution.  This can only happen if these functions are called with a misaligned buffer.  I looked at quite a bit of source code, and tested applications with a patched glibc that logs misaligned buffers.  I did not observe any such misaligned buffers.
