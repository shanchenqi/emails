Both "Access bypass" and "Information Disclosure" are mentioned in <font along with the phrase "Multiple vulnerabilities." However, also says that "The module does not sufficiently check node access when showing (and creating) the PDF certificates. This can lead to users seeing certificates they should not have access to."  This suggests a single root cause - lack of node access checks - which could lead to information disclosure.  If so, then from the CVE perspective, this would be one vulnerability and one ID would be assigned.  ---  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ]  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
