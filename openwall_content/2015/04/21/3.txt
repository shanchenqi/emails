First, we think you mean that there is a | security impact (not necessarily the same security impact) in both the | BMDMA case and the AHCI case: is that correct?    Yes, that's correct.  | Possibility 1: |  |   1A: one CVE ID for the use of "return s->io_buffer_size != 0" - this |       made it impossible for other parts of the code to distinguish |       between the "0 bytes" case and the "0 complete sectors" case, |       and caused both impacts: "leaked memory for short PRDTs" and |       "infinite loops and resource usage" |  |   1B: one CVE ID for lack of the 2 GiB limit checking |  | Possibility 2: |  |   One CVE ID only for item 1A above. 1B has no security impact (e.g., |   because it only allows the guest to conduct a DoS attack against |   itself with a large transfer attempt, or for some other reason)    IMO, possibility #2 is apt. It covers both the issues affecting BMDMA &  AHCI.
