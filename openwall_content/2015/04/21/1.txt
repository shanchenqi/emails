I haven't reproduced the bug or analysed the code myself; this is only based on what I've been told.  - The affected code paths are reachable through AF_ALG, but only using   the algif_aead module which has not been included in any released   kernel.  The module and the fix will be part of Linux 4.1.  So this   attack vector can be largely ignored.  - The kernel developers thought that these code paths were not used for   decrypting packets for IPsec tunnels.  However, they are if a packet   is reassembled from IP fragments.  This really does cause DoS,   confirmed in  Ben.  --  Ben Hutchings Once a job is fouled up, anything done to improve it makes it worse.
