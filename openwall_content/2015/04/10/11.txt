In order to ensure full traceability, we need a CVE number assigned that we can attach to further notifications. This issue is already public.  Title: Read-only directory traversal in Etherpad Minify Reporter: Tom Hunkapiller Versions: through  Description: Tom Hunkapiller reported a vulnerability in the minify feature of current Etherpad releases. Backslashes are replaced with slashes in the path parameter of HTTP API calls after path normalization is applied, allowing an attacker supplying specially-crafted requests to remotely read arbitrary files on the server's filesystem with the privileges of the account running the service.  Notes: This bug was introduced in commit which was initially included in the release, and is fixed in commit which will appear in a future release.
