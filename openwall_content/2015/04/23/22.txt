From the original Debian bug report: """ This is how mktexlsr uses temporary files (with boring parts snipped):  treefile="${TMPDIR-/tmp}/mktexlsrtrees$$.tmp" # ... while test $# -gt 0; do    # ...    (umask    if echo "$1" >>"$treefile"; then :; else      echo "$progname: $treefile: could not append to arg file, goodbye." >&2      exit 1    fi    # ... done   This is insecure because the filename is predictable and, more  importantly, the program doesn't fail atomically if the file already  exists.
