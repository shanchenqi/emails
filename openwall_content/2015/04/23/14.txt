The documentation mentions:    After setting up the environment it is advisable to update certificates   from time to time, if only to extend the validity interval.   Simply run   @code{ntp-keygen}   with the same flags as before to generate new certificates  It seems plausible that some sites may have created a web interface so that operations staff can occasionally do a certificate update (maybe with a new key), but these staff don't have login access to the machine running NTP. The flaw would give them the new ability to (sometimes) launch a CPU consumption attack. However, we have not actually heard of anyone with a web-based ntp-keygen arrangement, so we currently don't want to assign a CVE ID for that.  > the fact that > ntp-keygen generates non-random keys is.

Use for this code error that results in a key space that's much smaller than expected.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =yDz2 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
