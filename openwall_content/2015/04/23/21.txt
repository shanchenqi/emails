Well, then make sure that you only use the openat calls and walk only a single level of directory at any time. Otherwise O_NOFOLLOW is futile and any file or /proc/[pid]/ data may end up in the backup or to be AV-scanned.  I would avoid going over FUSE-mounts also, there are so many ways to block the process or play tricks with changing directory content.  And of course, have fd open before opening anything else writable, otherwise random open and error message may have unexpected side effects  Download attachment "smime.p7s" of type "application/pkcs7-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
