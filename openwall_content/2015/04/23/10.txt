Well, that's your opinion Marc, and I'd disagree!

Sure, that's the theory. It doesn't work that way in practice!  The history of Zardoz, vendor-sec and others are littered with doing more harm than good. Frankly, they usually end up being secret feeds of free exploits for attackers while their victims sit in blissful ignorance.  > Yes, sometimes the fix is inadequate and needs to be > fixed, but publishing an exploit without a few days notice just makes matters > unbearable for users and encourages vendors to keep security issues secret.  Naturally, I think it makes things better. There are only two possible states during an embargo, vulnerable and ignorant or vulnerable and aware. I certainly prefer the latter, and I'm quite sure I'm not alone. Information allows action to be taken, where as secrecy requires hoping and praying that only one person is smart enough to discover the problem.  There are so many advantages to discussing and developing software in the open that it's tough to enumerate them all! Presumably you agree this is true for software development in general (or why would you care about free software?), but dismiss it when security is involved. You get peer review, and you get to mitigate bugs as early as possible - this is more important than ever when security is involved!  Nevertheless, I'm willing to do as you wish in future for other Ubuntu bugs.  Tavis.
