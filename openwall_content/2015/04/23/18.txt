Do we still have to guard against that?  Or is that a thing of the past?  At least before containers, the risk is greatly reduced because /dev is a separate file system these days, so you can only use symbolic links, and those are more straightforward to deal with (hard links need O_PATH for a race- and side-effect-free link count check).  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
