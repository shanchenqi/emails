Nonsense, embargoes for local or remote privilege escalations are still considered to be high priority and should be handled with an embargo.  Making this type of information public without giving the vendor a chance to publish updates within a reasonable timeframe is a great disservice to users and exposes them to great risk.  >  >> Please do inform us privately of further local root escalations in the >> future, either via security@...ntu.com or filing "private security" >> bugs against the corresponding package in Launchpad. >> >> Thanks >  > Embargoes tend to make things worse, see your apport patch developed during > embargo or shellshock for examples.

Yes, sometimes the fix is inadequate and needs to be fixed, but publishing an exploit without a few days notice just makes matters unbearable for users and encourages vendors to keep security issues secret.
