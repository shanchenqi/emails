Do you possibly mean "vendor's" rather than "vendors" - that is, upstream's list?  (I do not recall seeing this on the linux-distros list.)  Either way, it sounds weird to keep a low severity issue private.  Low severity usually means not needing an embargo in the first place.  But I guess it was the vendor's preference?
