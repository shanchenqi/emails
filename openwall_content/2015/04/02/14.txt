I had been wondering about the delays so many thanks for your email.  What's not entirely clear to me is how you're dealing with the existing backlog. Are reporters expected to re-submit requests?  For example, I have two outstanding requests from mid-February:    1. glibc   2. xrdp  Are those still on MITRE's radar screen? Thanks.  --mancha  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
