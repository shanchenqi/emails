To reduce the window of vulnerability, we privately reported it to major distributions first, aligning everyone on the same release date. Such synchronization takes time. Given that the bug was not, to the best of our knowledge, exploited in the wild, we believed that 3 months of embargo is not exuberated. This is a common practice in the security industry, called "responsible disclosure."  Following the kernel  security bugs policy [1], we reported it to  the kernel security contacts few days before making the issue public. Few days after issue became public, we published a clear report to all of the relevant mailing lists.  > I assume we want it in 4.0 and -stable?  Yes. Should be applied ASAP to all kernels that contain uverbs. We put some effort to make sure the patch will apply cleanly on all historical versions of the kernel, so backporting should be simple.
