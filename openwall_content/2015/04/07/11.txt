Credit: Daniel LeCheminant (@d_lec)  Download: https://rubygems.org/gems/redcarpet  Description: Markdown to (X)HTML parser  Fix:  This fix is included in Redcarpet  Initial research suggests this issue affects:  * https://github.com/vmg/sundown (last version before the library was deprecated) * https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet * https://github.com/hoedown/hoedown  It also affects other (less popular) libraries based off of sundown, including:  * https://github.com/benmills/robotskirt * https://github.com/FSX/misaka * https://github.com/chobie/php-sundown  Users of these libraries may be vulnerable if the autolink extension is enabled.
