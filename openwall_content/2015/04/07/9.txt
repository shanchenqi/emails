Hanno's trick of storing TLS packets as files is clever, but doesn't scale far beyond testing handshakes of a handful of protocols, and that with some effort.  If AFL could grow the ability to mangle socket-based inputs, it would probably be more applicable to many more services, and beyond just handshaking.  I realize it's asking for a unicorn when we've already been given a pony, but there it is.
