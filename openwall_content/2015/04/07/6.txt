A request with a specially crafted URL could execute malicious JavaScript in the user's web browser. The attacker would have to convince the user to click the attacker's crafted link.  This only affects the output of the 'asdoc' tool, not the output of the 'mxmlc' compiler or deployed Apache Flex applications.  Mitigation: Users should upgrade to the most recent version of Apache Flex and regenerate any local files produced by the asdoc tool. If you have made local modifications to the asdoc index.html file, such as altering the TITLE tags, you will need to make sure these are preserved.  Alternatively, apply the following changes to any already generated asdoc index.html files, as well as to the file asdoc/templates/index.html in any older Apache Flex SDKs http://bit.ly/apache-flex-asdoc-fix  Credit: Thanks to Radjnies Bhansingh of Securify BV for reporting this issue.
