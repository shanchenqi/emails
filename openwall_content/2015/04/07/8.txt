You know... on some level, I'm happy - but on another, I'm always trying to be skeptical when such claims are made for other projects. It's only fair not to treat this case differently.  It's worth remembering that the authors of several static analysis or symbolic execution frameworks have also claimed that their products would have found Heartbleed. IIRC, their experiments were far more convoluted than Hanno's, but the bottom line is that when you're trying to "discover" a bug you already know about, it's almost impossible to avoid subconsciously optimizing for the expected outcome.  So, I always urge people to ask a simple question: would someone think of running the tool this particular way and on this particular code before we knew about the bug? And if yes, why haven't they?=)  The answer I've always heard from commercial software vendors is that "they had no time to work on open source projects", but that's about as unconvincing as it gets. I bet they would love to be credited for this or any comparably serious find. Today, I'm asking myself the same question about AFL. Was it too counterintuitive to set this up? Were there other barriers to entry? Can I fix this now?  Cheers, /mz  On Tue, Apr 7, at PM, David A.
