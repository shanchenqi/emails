As RMI is an API for the transport and remote execution of serialized Java, anyone with access to this interface can execute arbitrary code as the running user.  Mitigation: 1.2.x has reached EOL, so users of <= 1.2.x are recommended to upgrade to a supported version of Cassandra, or manually configure encryption and authentication of JMX, (seehttps://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/JmxSecurity). 2.0.x users should upgrade to 2.1.x users should upgrade to Alternately, users of any version not wishing to upgrade can reconfigure JMX/RMI to enable encryption and authentication according to https://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/JmxSecurityor http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html  Credit: This issue was discovered by Georgi Geshev of MWR InfoSecurity  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
