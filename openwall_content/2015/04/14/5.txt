I've already contacted the WordPress.org team and the plugin authors, who either released updates already or are working on a fix. I've also sent a mail to cve-assign@...re.org asking for instructions on how to get CVE IDs assigned to those 3 vulnerabilities but didn't get a response yet.  1) WP Community Events plugin SQL injection vulnerability Affected version: (and likely all versions below) Fixed version: 1.4 Plugin URL: https://wordpress.org/plugins/community-events/ Changelog: https://wordpress.org/plugins/community-events/changelog/  2) WP Tune Library plugin SQL injection vulnerability Affected version: (and likely all versions below) Fixed version: Plugin URL: https://wordpress.org/plugins/tune-library/ Changelog: https://wordpress.org/plugins/tune-library/changelog/  3) WP Symposium plugin SQL injection vulnerability Affected version: (and likely all versions below) Fixed version: Not yet available, author is working on a fix Plugin URL: https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-symposium/  (still disabled by WordPress.org team)  If you need any further information please let me know!
