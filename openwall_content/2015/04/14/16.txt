The bugs appear to have been introduced by commit ("crypto: aesni-intel - AES-GCM Driver Using Intel New Instructions") in Linux  The above fix is included in Linux 4.0 and the following stable updates:  crypto: aesni - fix memory usage in GCM decryption crypto: aesni - fix memory usage in GCM decryption crypto: aesni - fix memory usage in GCM decryption crypto: aesni - fix memory usage in GCM decryption crypto: aesni - fix memory usage in GCM decryption crypto: aesni - fix memory usage in GCM decryption  Please assign a CVE ID for this.
