In other words, minimum information for a report about one open-source product could be:   - is part of the report about a vulnerability affecting one    version, and another part of the report about a vulnerability    affecting a different version?   - is part of the report about a vulnerability that became public    at one point in time, and another part of the report about a    vulnerability that became public at a different point in time,    such that customers may realistically have an installation that    already has a fix for only the first part?   - is part of the report about a vulnerability discovered by one    person/organization, and another part of the report about a    vulnerability discovered by a different person/organization?   - is there any reasonable interpretation that part of the report    is about one "vulnerability type" and another part of the report    is about a different "vulnerability type"? (We know that there    is no possible definition of "vulnerability type" that makes    sense for every conceivable security-research effort that may be    occurring now or in the future.)  "already very familiar" isn't the common case, though.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =L6eh -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
