As I unfortunately wasn't aware of the forum posting when I did my analysis I also cross-checked releases before the rewrite (thanks Martin PrpiÄ). The predecessors of zarafa-search-plus are creating the /var/lib/zarafa/search/ or /var/lib/zarafa/index/ directory with the correct permissions, however some of the sub-directories and files (also created by the search daemon) are world-readable (see comment #2 of for details) through. I am not sure how this should be treated, given that all Zarafa search/index daemons do not seem to have built-in permission checks (like e.g. fetchmail has) and thus also accept an existing directory with incorrect permissions.
