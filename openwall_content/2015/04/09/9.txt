The changelog states: "Fix an issue where keyring permissions were world readable"  The problem was that the keyring file would be created with mode. If ceph-deploy was run as a dedicated non-root admin user, the keys would be readable to all other (non-admin) users of the same group, thus leaking authentication credentials.
