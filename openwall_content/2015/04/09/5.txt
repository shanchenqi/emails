Patch:  While the endless loop is not a security flaw per se, the fact that ntp-keygen generates non-random keys is. If the lowest byte of the temp variable happens to be between and 0x7f and not #, the generated MD5 key will consist of 20 identical characters, meaning only 93 possible keys can be generated.  Can a CVE be please assigned for this issue?
