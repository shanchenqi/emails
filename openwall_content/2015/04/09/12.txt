It might be worthwhile to answer this in two ways.  First, the scope of the assignment does cover application code that was built with this macro, in the sense that applications cannot have their own unique CVE IDs for the same problem. In other words, if building with this macro is what is calling an application's security into question, then there wouldn't be a separate CVE ID for that application.  Second, if an application's vendor wants to publish a security advisory mapping to then it is preferable for the vendor to verify that the existence of the macro actually has a security impact for that application. However, there is no reasonable way for the MITRE CVE team to require that. An application's vendor might not have the resources or expertise. For example, the application's vendor optionally could decide to map to based only on noticing that the macro is used.  In any case, the information posted by others in this thread would be very useful for risk-assessment questions that go beyond "how can this CVE ID be used."  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =DjB/ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
