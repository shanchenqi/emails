As outlined here, there is a security issue in the Debian packages for zfsonlinux which will export NFS shares to * when you only intend for  Some notes: -> Debian packages for zfsonlinux were using extra patches for NFS, iSCSI and other shares not present in upstream zfsonlinux -> These patches were included by the maintainer of the Debian packages against upstream's wishes  NFS users who are exporting host-specific shares from CentOS/FreeBSD/illumos who switch to Debian will certainly be surprised to find their NFS shares are wide open.  Can we have a CVE for tracking this, as it's a unique issue which has apparently been in the Debian packages for some time now.  No other zfsonlinux distribution suffers these issues.  --   Kash Pande Jentu Technologies, Inc. http://jentu-networks.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
