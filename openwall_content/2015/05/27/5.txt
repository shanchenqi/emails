A variety of issues have been found in Linux's ozwpan driver.  1. A remote packet can be sent, resulting in funny subtractions of signed integers, which causes a memcpy(kernel_heap, network_user_buffer, -network_user_provided_length).  There are two different conditions that can lead to this: You may want to give two CVEs or just one CVE for these two issues.  2. A remote packet can be sent, resulting in divide-by-zero in softirq, causing hard crash:  3. A remote packet can be sent, resulting in a funny subtraction, causing an insanely big loop to lock up the kernel:  4. Multiple out-of-bounds reads, resulting in possible information leakage, explained in the last paragraph of the introductory email here:   Please assign CVEs so that these can be properly tracked. I've been told the v2 of these patches are in the merging queue.
