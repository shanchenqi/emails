There must be documentation indicating that an end user may wish to have the applicable non-default build.  As far as we know, MIT Kerberos 5 does not document DEBUG_ASN1 for use by end users. It seems reasonable to expect that those code sections are only intended for use during development, and that there's a cost/benefit tradeoff to addressing all possible risks to their developers' machines. There won't be a CVE mapping for this DEBUG_ASN1 report unless the upstream vendor requests one.  > To: ...
