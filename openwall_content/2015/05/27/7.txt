This can cause unwanted dialogs appearing in applications and changes in the application behaviour that can include the app force-closing.  The latest release of Cordova Android entirely removes the ability of configuration parameters to be set by intents.  This change is an API change in the platform, and third-party plugins that use values set in the config.xml should make sure that they use the preferences API instead of relying on the Intent bundle, whcih can be manipulated in this case.  Upgrade path: Developers who are concerned about this should rebuild their applications with either Cordova Android or Cordova if they are unable to upgrade to Cordova Developers should also make sure that variables that they wish to have protected are specified in their config.xml.
