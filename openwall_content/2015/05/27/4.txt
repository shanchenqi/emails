The "#if 0" also apparently exists in the that's included in the file.  > ./libfreerdp-gdi/gdi.c > #ifdef DUMP_REMOTEFX_TILES >                        sprintf(tile_bitmap, "/tmp/rfx/tile_%d.bmp",  As far as we can tell, there is no build option for DUMP_REMOTEFX_TILES or documentation recommending that an end user define DUMP_REMOTEFX_TILES, either in the upstream distribution or in a source RPM.  > Actually it looks like upstream fixed both of them already so one CVE > can do (I don't think it's important enough to SPLIT/MERGE properly).  Even if there were a different SPLIT/MERGE process for less important cases, a single CVE ID for issues reported in different versions would be among the harder process changes because it affects whether (or how) the CVE ID could be used on the cve.mitre.org web site, and complicates some types of patch-based remediation.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =s9NW -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
