On affected systems the random bits are degraded to Unfortunately, depending on the PaX Kernel configuration sequence, some features may not be enabled. There are sequences of PaX configuration which does not give the expected result.  The configuration sequence that results in a miss-configured system is:       1.- Starting from a clean Linux tree with PaX patch applied.       2.- Enabled the "Grsecurity" option (which sets "Security Method" to "Custom") and compile&test:      Observed mmap entropy: 2^5 (as expected).       3.- Then set "Security Method" to "Automatic" (which sets "Required  Priorities" to "Performance") and compile&test:      Observed mmap entropy: 2^5.       4.- Last test: select "Security" on the "Required Priorities" option and compile&test:      Observed mmap entropy: 2^5.       5.- At this point, it seems that the "Required Priorities" option has no effect, that is, switching from "Performance" to "Security" or the other way around (as may times as desired) does not enable/disable the expected features, including the mmap randomization.  If steps 2 and 3, or 2 and 4 are configured at once (without exiting from the menuconfig), then the system gets properly configured.   It seems that something in the PaX Kconfig files are not properly done. Could  anyone check it ? So, if you are using PaX, it worth to ensure that you are not  losing any PaX feature.   --  Hector Marco-Gisbert @ http://hmarco.org/ Cyber Security Researcher @ http://cybersecurity.upv.es Universitat PolitĂ¨cnica de ValĂ¨ncia (Spain)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
