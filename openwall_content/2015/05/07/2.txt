But things are comlicated: There was some breakage in regarding TLS so some distros (I know this from Gentoo) backported some TLS related patches to therefore you could also see it there.  Also, you'll probably only see this with SSLv3 disabled. (at least that's the only situation where this particular crash in openssl can be triggered, but there may be other codepaths affected by that problem)  --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
