There now is a pull request on Github [1] to get this issue fixed in   Caja. I just (a minute ago) received notification from upstream that   the PR will get merged ASAP.  So upstream plans to fix this with the next release of caja (probably   and it is considered an issue (similar to how it was considered   an issue in the nautilus browser where Caja has been forked from).  light+love, Mike (from the Debian MATE Packaging Team)  [1] --   DAS-NETZWERKTEAM mike gabriel, herweg 7, fleckeby fon: +49  GnuPG Key ID mail: mike.gabriel@...-netzwerkteam.de, http://das-netzwerkteam.de  freeBusy: https://mail.das-netzwerkteam.de/freebusy/m.gabriel%40das-netzwerkteam.de.xfb  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
