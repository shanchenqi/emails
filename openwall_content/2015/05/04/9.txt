Some examples include: ================= This is well-known PHP-trick. Use === to right result.   php > == md5('QNKCDZO'));   bool(true)   php >   md5('QNKCDZO'));     string(32)   string(32)   php > ===   md5('QNKCDZO'));     bool(false)   php > ==   bool(true)   php > ===   bool(false)   php > ===   md5('QNKCDZO'));     bool(false)   php > ==   md5('QNKCDZO'));    bool(true)   php > === md5('QNKCDZO'));   bool(false) =================  I'm guessing there is more than a bit of code that uses == to compare passwords/etc. Something to be aware of.   --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
