In order to ensure full traceability, we need a CVE number assigned that we can attach to further notifications. This issue is already public, although an advisory was not sent yet.  Title: Potential Keystone cache backend password leak in log Reporter: Eric Brown (VMware) Products: Keystone Affects: versions through and versions through  Description: Eric Brown from VMware reported a vulnerability in Keystone. The backend_argument configuration option content is being logged, and it may contain sensitive information for specific backends (like a password for MongoDB). An attacker with read access to Keystone logs may therefore obtain sensitive data about certain backends. All Keystone setups are potentially impacted.
