Issue #2 and Issue #4 begin by describing essentially the same type of problem. The user is supposed to be providing an integer value that can be used within a .php file, but the unpatched product let the user specify arbitrary PHP code instead of an integer. For this problem, with affected versions of "before 2.5," use  The remaining errors in version 2.5 seem to have two distinct types, at least from the perspective of the advisory (we did not independently study the complete code).  For the Issue #2 section, apparently the 2.5 code was attempting to safely include untrusted input inside of a string literal, but a wrong approach was used. Use for this problem.  For the Issue #4 section, apparently the 2.5 code was attempting to identify specific characters that may be special to PHP (or may be special to a shell) but did not achieve a complete solution. (For example, the ';' character was blocked in 2.5, but the '.' character was not blocked.) Use for this problem.  The final concern is Issue #3. We believe it's valuable to search for duplicate CVEs, but there was no comment about whether is the same issue. If that issue was fixed and then reintroduced between versions 2.1 and 2.5, then there can be two new CVE IDs for the report.  If that issue was never fixed, then there was a duplicate discovery. We believe that applies to the larger problem: an attacker could use any number of "../" sequences after the "get_file.php?view=" part of the URI, including zero "../" sequences. There would then be one additional CVE ID for the behavior in 2.5, because that behavior represents an incomplete fix for  By default, we would use the second interpretation for Issue #3. In other words, unless someone can establish that was fixed in 2.2, 2.3, or 2.4, we'll conclude that Issue #3 is a duplicate discovery, and we'll send the one ID for the "incomplete fix" CVE.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =kMZ4 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
