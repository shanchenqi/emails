The dcraw tool, as well as several other projects re-using its code, suffers from an integer overflow condition which lead to a buffer overflow. The vulnerability concerns the 'len' variable, parsed without validation from opened images, used in the ljpeg_start() function.  A maliciously crafted raw image file can be used to trigger the vulnerability, causing a Denial of Service condition.
