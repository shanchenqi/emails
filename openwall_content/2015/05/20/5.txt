Deadline has expired without contact from vendor, so disclosing.  The vulnerability is a simple shell upload via avoiding a rather rubbish blacklist used to try (and fail) to prevent the upload of executable code. Fully automatic PoC included for testing/replicating the issue. Due to the fact they clearly intended to prevent upload/execution of executable code, I am of the view it is a vulnerability as opposed to abuse of functionality.   PoC: https://github.com/XiphosResearch/exploits/tree/master/suiteshell  Best regards, Darren Martyn   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
