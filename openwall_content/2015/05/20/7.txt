While they mention other protocols, IKE / IPsec are not really (as) vulnerable. The original IKE design from November has a minimum MODP group of bits. Why is TLS till allowing bits SEVENTEEN years later?  I did a write up on MODP and IKE/IPsec from the freeswan/openswan/libreswan point of view:        TL;DR The LogJam downgrade attack does not apply to MODP groups in the IKE protocol, only to TLS, so IKE or IPsec is not impacted.      If you are using libreswan you are not vulnerable to weak MODP groups and using per default unless specifically configured for a lower MODP group.     If you are using openswan with IKEv2 you are using but if you are using IKEv1 you are using which is still much stronger than or      Libreswan as a client to a weak server will allow in IKEv1 as the least secure option, and in IKEv2 as the least secure option.     Openswan does not properly implement INVALID_KE, so it cannot connect to another DH group than the one it started out as, so it runs the risk of getting locked out if the server side bumps their minimum MODP group to openswan defaults to in IKEv1 and in IKEv2  [...]  Paul   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
