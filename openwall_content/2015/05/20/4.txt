Already in July Kazuho Oku described a JSON injection issue in the SQL::Maker Perl package, discovered by his colleague Toshiharu Sugiyama:    Additional SQL frameworks could be affected if they implement such queries and are used with JSON frameworks which produce dict/hash objects native to the programming language (so that they are indistinguishable from query expressions).  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
