More precisely, this is  what they do:  * create a unique temporary file directly in /tmp (or in $TMPDIR) * pass name of this file to c44 as the output file name  Unfortunately, it turns out that c44 deletes the output file, and then  creates a new one under the same name (without O_EXCL). This opens a  race window, during which malicious user could their own file under this  name.  The bugs were fixed in didjvu 0.4 and pdf2djvu Please assign CVEs to these vulnerabilities.
