One of them, found by a researcher using afl-fuzz, was in the set_cs_start function in t1disasm.c. The other, apparently found manually by the vendor, was in the main function of t1asm.c. There are similar situations in which there might have been two CVE IDs assigned. Here, however, we feel that there should be only one CVE ID, because it seems extremely unlikely that t1disasm.c and t1asm.c had independent mistakes. Almost certainly, the mistake was made once and then copied from one file into the other.
