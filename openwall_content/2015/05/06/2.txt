Use  In most cases, this specific class of /tmp misuse issues is unrelated to Symlink Following. However, when such an issue exists, it is conceivable that a Symlink Following vulnerability also exists, could be fixed independently, and would be of interest to an attacker who has a goal of overwriting a file rather than directly executing code. The MITRE CVE team has not done any original research to check for a Symlink Following vulnerability. If a Symlink Following vulnerability were to exist, it would not be within the scope of  Also, the message refers to "usage of YAML in a insecure way." We have not done any original research to determine whether, in a scenario where the "untrusted location under /tmp" were no longer used, a YAML-related vulnerability would still be exploitable. If an independent "YAML misuse" vulnerability were to exist, it would not be within the scope of  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =NJDF -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
