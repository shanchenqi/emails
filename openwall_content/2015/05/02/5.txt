The bug was reported to the linux security group and it has been fixed.(commit ("ipv4: Missing sk_nulls_node_init() in ping_unhash()"). You can find the fix commit here: The bug exists in all versions of linux kernel. And the credit is to Wen Xu and wushi of KeenTeam. I am looking forward to your reply.  Thanks, Wen Xu @ Keen Team    ---------- Forwarded message ---------- From: Willy Tarreau <w@....eu> Date: Subject: Re: Socket Vulnerability Report (Lead to kernel arbitrary execution) from KeenTeam To: Wen Xu Cc: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@...ux-foundation.org>, David Miller < davem@...emloft.net>, "security@...nel.org" <security@...nel.org>   On Sat, May 02, at Wen Xu wrote: > Many thanks, we've already seen the patch commit ;) > By the way, as security researchers, if we want a CVE number for this ping > socket bug, where could we request for?
