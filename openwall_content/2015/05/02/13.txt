But for most, it is 'no'.  I agree achieving end-to-end (E2E) security with interposition is an interesting security research area. In fact, it would be great if as a result of this thread more members of the infosec and oss communities were motivated to tackle that.   > In the specific Hushmail example, would it alleviate peoples concerns > if the Cloudflare MITM-busting behaviour took place entirely inside > Canada?  If not, how do you propose an alternative?

More specifically, breaking E2E security with interposition adds well-known complications/issues: rogue employees at the interposing service, increased attack surfaces, more points of failure, inability to verify path integrity, inability to verify content integrity, misconstruing of communications as E2E-secure by non-experts, among many others.   As you said, lots of people are interested in ways of achieving E2E security with intermediation - precisely because there is recognition current TLS interposition models are not satisfactory.   My specific interest is how OSS projects (e.g. browsers, TLS stacks, etc.) can address security issues that arise from SSL/TLS interposition. Also of interest is leveraging the intersection of infosec/oss/crypto to develop related innovations (e.g. interposition that coexists with uncompromised E2E security).   --mancha  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
