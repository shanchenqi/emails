Oh, so Android 4.3+ enables ping sockets for all apps by default?

I found no mistakes on your part - just too brief a message requiring further analysis to determine actual impact of the bug.  The bug does exist in all currently supported upstream kernel versions, as you say, even if its security relevance varies from none to full local privesc across archs and distros.  > So as you said MITRE could give us a CVE ID?

So, who's to post a patch to LKML to adjust default LIST_POISON*?  Vasily?
