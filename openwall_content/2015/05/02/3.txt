So in the end, we manage to have permission like this :  d-ws-w-rwt.  And o+rw and u+s kinda sound bad. The directory is created in $PWD if  I read the code right, so that's likely the homedir of 1 admin. However, that's executed locally, or from a bastion, so there isn't much venue to attack ( even if shared shell server still exist nowadays ), and this requires to use spacewalk.  I pushed a commit there :  I will wait for a CVE to be assigned before fixing the commit message, and push a  PR ( cause i am quite bothered when I cannot find the CVE in the commit message)  --  Michael Scherer  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
