Despite whatever infrastructure and other real world challenges a  company/organisation faces, what you write above is the most important  issue. When we all see the lock in the URL bar, we expect and hope that  the communications between our browser and the company/organisation is  encrypted *all the way* to the company/org we identify in the URL.  This is a fundamental issue of trust which cannot be broken at all  costs, even if it means more disruption to services. There is very  little trust left out there and we cannot afford to erode it further, as  this is more damaging than less service availability.
