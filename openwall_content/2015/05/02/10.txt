The CVE is just a way to track the issue. Not all problem with a CVE requires a immediate update ( or even a update at all ), even if people think  "there is a CVE so we must fix fast".  I do not consider it critical either to be handled privately, hence the cc to  oss-sec to get the opinion of others.  > First of all, the impacted script is an optional inventory > script, which is not packaged with Ansible directly and must be downloaded > from the source repository.

One potential attack is also that someone inject data in the cache, since the file is open without checking for permission, either read or write. So if I inject in the cache a server that I control, I can make ansible  connect to it, and make it deploy a role with password/certificate  that I may not be able to access usually.  So the impact is potential information disclosure, not on spacewalk  level, but on the ansible level.  One example of such setup (minus the spacewalk thing) would Fedora, where only few people have access to the private information and everybody is required to use ansible via sudo on a shared bastion to make changes. And where most people  do not have root access to all servers. I think such tiered access schemes are not that uncommon.  So yeah, it is a very specific scenario, and the combination of using spacewalk and that use case make it unlikely to be a problem in practice for most people,  so it is not critical to fix right away, I agree. But still a CVE would be useful for tracking.  > If a CVE is issued, we can mention it in the release, but we'd much rather > simply fix this ASAP and include it in the next major/minor release of > Ansible (2.0 and respectively).  2.0 is not ready, so the real question is around is it planned to be out very soon ? What about saying "we wait a few days for the CVE", and then merge the patch if the CVE is not assigned by the 5th of may ?  --  Michael Scherer  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
