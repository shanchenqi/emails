First of all, the impacted script is an optional inventory script, which is not packaged with Ansible directly and must be downloaded from the source repository. Second, the script (as you mentioned) creates this directory typically in a relatively secure location, so the chances of it being exposed are greatly lessened. Also, this is a relatively under-utilized script, as not many people that we know of are getting host information from Spacewalk using this script. Finally, the data contained within that cache file is not very sensitive, and would typically only contain the host IP information of systems from Spacewalk.  If a CVE is issued, we can mention it in the release, but we'd much rather simply fix this ASAP and include it in the next major/minor release of Ansible (2.0 and respectively).  Thanks!
