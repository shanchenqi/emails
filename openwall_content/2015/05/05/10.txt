We now have a public tracking bug listing the issues: >  >    We have identified one more issue:  abrt-action-install-debuginfo-to-abrt-cache is a SUID wrapper which incorrectly filters the process environment (umask and truncated command line arguments such as â--caâ) before invoking the actual program.  This allows a local attacker to create a world-writable problem directory and eventually escalate their privileges to root.  (Other attacks against the cpio extraction might be feasible.)   Jakub Filak has created several pull requests fixing all the issues identified so far:         There is a public build (against EPEL7) of the consolidated fixes, available as a Copr repository:    <http://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/jfilak/abrt-hardened/>  This also includes the consolidated fixes.  At this stage, we'd appreciate additional comments/reviews.  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
