The gem is pulled by various projects on github, the likely most important being a redmine plugin : https://github.com/backlogs/redmine_backlogs   Could a CVE be assigned ? I will take care of opening a issue on github  for that after : https://github.com/tigris/open-uri-cached  --  Michael Scherer  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
