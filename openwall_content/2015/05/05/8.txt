That has the effect of allowing MD5 > signatures (which are disabled by default) in the ServerKeyExchange > message. It is not believed that this bug can be exploited because a > fraudulent signature has to be generated in real-time which is not > known to be possible. However, since attacks can only get better it > is recommended to update to a GnuTLS version which addresses the > issue.
