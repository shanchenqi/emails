We also encountered server crashes and problems which looked like race conditions, affecting server stability.  KDE uses a private UNIX domain socket to communicate with a user-specific database server, but the database server can be accessed over TCP as well.  Upstream did not release a security advisory, but alluded to the fixes in release announcement:  <http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/dataspace/doc/dav/wiki/Main/VOSNews#Client%20RPC>  And in commit messages:  <https://github.com/openlink/virtuoso-opensource/commits/develop/6/libsrc/Dk>  We have not assigned CVE identifiers because the number of different crashes we saw was fairly large, and we could not completely understand how the RPC implementation is pieced together.  I'm sorry that this message is not particularly helpful.  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
