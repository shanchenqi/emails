In for abrt, the root directory argument for dd_create_basic_files is changed to NULL, which means that the copying inside dd_create_basic_files will not happen (although the code is still around).  As far as I can tell, this patch is also applied in the build.  Is there some other copying operation I'm missing?  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
