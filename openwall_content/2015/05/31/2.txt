We think you mean something like:    The vulnerabilities are independent because:    - if only the CSRF were fixed, then an editor could     intentionally conduct an XSS attack against an Administrator    - if only the XSS were fixed, then an attacker could trigger use of     their own text for a "More" button within the plugin, e.g.,     by replacing the default word "More" with the attacker-supplied     word "0wned" - and this would be visible to all site visitors  In that case:  Vulnerability Type:   CWE-79: Cross-site scripting            Cross-Site Request Forgery    - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
