This could result in a buffer read overflow when processing an invalid message." issues in both and  Use for "The remaining number of bytes in the message could be smaller than the Total-Length field size, so the length needs to be explicitly checked prior to reading the field and decrementing the len variable. This could have resulted in the remaining length becoming negative and interpreted as a huge positive integer." in both and  Use for "check that there is no already started fragment in progress before allocating a new buffer for reassembling fragments. This avoid a potential memory leak when processing invalid message." in both and  Use for  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =TOs/ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
