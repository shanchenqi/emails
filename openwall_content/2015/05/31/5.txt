The PCRE library is incorporated into a number of prominent programs, such as the Adobe Flash, Apache, Nginx and PHP.    PCRE library is prone to a vulnerability which leads to Stack Overflow. Without enough bound checking inside compile_regex(), the stack memory could be overflowed via a crafted regular expression. Since PCRE library is widely used, this vulnerability should affect many applications. An attacker may exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of the user running the affected application.    Info & fixed:   Could a CVE please be assigned to this issue?
