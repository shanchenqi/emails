Gday,  I'd like to ask for a CVE number for this the issue fixed in [1], as per their description:  -- vhost/scsi: potential memory corruption This code in vhost_scsi_make_tpg() is confusing because we limit "tpgt" to UINT_MAX but the data type of "tpg->tport_tpgt" and that is a u16.  I looked at the context and it turns out that in vhost_scsi_set_endpoint(), "tpg->tport_tpgt" is used as an offset into the vs_tpg[] array which has VHOST_SCSI_MAX_TARGET elements so anything higher than then it is invalid.  I have made that the limit now.  In vhost_scsi_send_evt() we mask away values higher than but now that the limit has changed, we don't need the mask. -- The first check that slips past is here:  -- drivers/vhost/scsi.c - vhost_scsi_make_tpg()   if (vs->vs_tpg && vs->vs_tpg[tpg->tport_tpgt])   My theory is that the possible memory corruption happens later:  -- drivers/vhost/scsi.c - vhost_scsi_make_tpg()    // sets this null pointer, to "tpg" value.   vs_tpg[tpg->tport_tpgt] = tpg;  When vs_tpg[tpg->tport_tpgt] = 0   It appears that no Red Hat Enter Linux versions are affected as the config directive CONFIG_VHOST_SCSI is not enabled in Red Hat Products.
