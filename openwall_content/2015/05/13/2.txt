ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The code in qemu which emulates a floppy disk controller did not correctly bounds check accesses to an array and therefore was vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.  IMPACT ======  A guest which has access to an emulated floppy device can exploit this vulnerability to take over the qemu process elevating its privilege to that of the qemu process.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen systems running x86 HVM guests without stubdomains are vulnerable to this depending on the specific guest configuration. The default configuration is vulnerable.  Guests using either the traditional "qemu-xen" or upstream qemu device models are vulnerable.  Guests using a qemu-dm stubdomain to run the device model are only vulnerable to takeover of that service domain.  Systems running only x86 PV guests are not vulnerable.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  Enabling stubdomains will mitigate this issue, by reducing the escalation to only those privileges accorded to the service domain.  qemu-dm stubdomains are only available with the traditional "qemu-xen" version.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Jason Geffner, Senior Security Researcher at CrowdStrike.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            qemu-upstream-unstable, Xen 4.5.x, Xen 4.4.x   qemu-upstream-unstable, Xen 4.3.x, Xen 4.2.x           qemu-xen-unstable, Xen 4.5.x, Xen 4.4.x, Xen 4.3.x, Xen 4.2.x  $    $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Deployment of the mitigation by enabling stubdomains is NOT permitted (except on systems used and administered only by organisations which are members of the Xen Project Security Issues Predisclosure List).  Specifically, deployment on public cloud systems is NOT permitted.  This is because this configuration change may be visible to the guest.  Also, distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
