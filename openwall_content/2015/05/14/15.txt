As it doesn't appear its going to get patched, a CVE is probably the right way to go.  Not sure if its just getting lost in the shuffle, but, this remote-code-execution vulnerability in Composer is widely deployed and trivially exploited.  I can give it a name/branding if it'll help speed up the CVE issuance.  --   Kevin McArthur   On PM, Pรกdraic Brady wrote: > Hi all, > > A brief update to clarify this is a CVE request in the subject line > and copy the guys at MITRE.
