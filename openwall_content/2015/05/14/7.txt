More specifically, it appears that mode 7 itself is, in some sense, deprecated (e.g., "mode7 ... Enables processing of NTP mode 7 implementation-specific requests which are used by the deprecated ntpdc program" on the http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/html/miscopt.html page and "functionally deprecating ntpdc" on the http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/SoftwareDownloads page). If so, then we do not feel that there is a requirement for the documentation to precisely specify the effect of a command-line option on a deprecated feature. The -A documentation doesn't directly make a false statement about authentication within mode 7; it simply does not discuss mode 7.  If mode 7 itself isn't deprecated, and there is a supported use case in which the user may choose to enable both mode 7 and the -A option, then announcing the behavior/documentation mismatch as a vulnerability is probably more useful.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =MpGY -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
