We're not going to announce this as a vulnerability.  I'm with Kurt on this one - from our POV '-A' means "disable authentication checks" and I'd bet that Prof. Mills wrote the documentation that says ... "this is almost never a good idea."  > More specifically, it appears that mode 7 itself is, in some sense, > deprecated (e.g., "mode7 ...

Mode 7 is for "vendor-specific" control operations, and there is no requirement in the protocol for any data structure in the packets. There is also no requirement for *any* use of mode 7.  We noticed enough difficulties trying to use mode 7 that we shifted everything to mode 6 (ntpq).  To be clear, this issue (-A) is about a discrepancy between the documentation and the behavior of older, EOL'd versions of the reference implementation of NTP.  I'll be looking to add clarifying language to our on-line set of documentation for older, EOL'd NTP releases, but that's all.  I haven't seen *any* other NTP implementation that provides either mode 6 or mode 7 support.  So I'm planning to make an announcement along the lines of "-A means 'disable authentication' and we've documented that this is almost never a good idea.  If you have done X in an environment that allows Y, that will allow bad guys to do Z.  That's a real problem and is an obvious case of why using -A is generally a Bad Idea."
