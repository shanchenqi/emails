The last commit mentioning bind mounts I could find is which says:        The issue of being able to escape a bind mount has not yet been       addressed, as the fixes are not yet mature"  And the public security issue trackers of Debian, Ubuntu and Redhat also say that the issue hasn't been fixed:   > Containers on Linux normally use bind mounts to restrict how much > of the filesystem is visible for processes inside the container. > However, if an attacker can gain capabilities within such a > container or can create another user and mount namespace within > the existing container, he can do something similar to a > double-chroot attack to break out of the bind mount and gain > access to the full filesystem to which the bind mount refers: >  > Create folders /A, /A/B, /C, /D inside the namespace. > Bind-mount the /A inside the namespace to /D. > Let a process chdir to /D/B. > Move /D/B over into /C. > The process which chdir'ed to /D/B is now in /C/B, but at the > same time it is in a bind mount with /D as root.
