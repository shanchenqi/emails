The upstream bug report is [2]. The bug is actually in libinfinity and the fix is available on [2].  libinfinity does support certificate pinning and hence contains the ability to disable some checks like trusted issuer and hostname verification. However the catch-all validity check was in the wrong location.  Please assign a CVE ID for this.  Kind regards and thanks Philipp Kern  [1] [2] https://github.com/gobby/gobby/issues/61 [3]  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
