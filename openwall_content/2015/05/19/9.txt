My point is: once you get to have a corrupted zval, there are tons of  functions that would result in memory errors if working on it. A str_repeat() with user-supplied arguments is not so common at all, but  let's say you have it (e.g.  http://phpcrossref.com/xref/jpegmeta/EXIF.php.html,  https://code.google.com/p/zimbra-api-php/,  http://phpcrossref.com/xref/jpegmeta/XML.php.html) it is really likely  that it would end up processed by one of these functions (string  concatenation, for example).  $makernote  <http://phpcrossref.com/xref/jpegmeta/_variables/makernote.html>  .=str_repeat  <http://phpcrossref.com/xref/jpegmeta/_functions/str_repeat.html>("\x00",($tiff_data  <http://phpcrossref.com/xref/jpegmeta/_variables/tiff_data.html>[ 'Makernote_Tag' ][ 'Offset' ] - 8 ) );    On Stanislav Malyshev wrote: > Hi! > >> About code execution, I haven't had the chance to focus on actual >> exploitation yet (I surely will in the near future), but as you can see >> from the original report I >> pointed out several cases in which working on a so-crafted zval would >> lead to invalid memory access (with user controlled values as well), so >> I am pretty confident it is achievable. > These examples all seem to require specific code (like > 'md5(str_repeat("a", to be run.
