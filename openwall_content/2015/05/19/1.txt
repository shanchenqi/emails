We are rejecting this CVE because there is, in effect, a specification indicating that PHP would not be the responsible product for any security issue related to a large number in the third argument to the gregoriantojd or juliantojd function.  The http://php.net/manual/en/function.gregoriantojd.php and http://php.net/manual/en/function.juliantojd.php pages state:    year       The year as a number between and    year       The year as a number between and  (Similar documentation has existed for several years, probably going back to when gregoriantojd and juliantojd were first implemented.)  The integer overflow occurs for a year much larger than (approximately million). This violates the specification, and it is reasonable for PHP's behavior to be undefined. It's conceivable that an open-source application exists with a security impact for untrusted input of a year such as million: in that case, a CVE ID could be assigned to that application.  (In other words, a CVE can exist for an integer overflow that is relevant only because of business logic. A CVE for an integer overflow does not require the overflow to have any effect on memory safety.)  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJVWqpkAAoJEKllVAevmvmsAxsIALNWNhkrF21EIeVWqvDTkrwz =AJ8l -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
