That is, being able to execute arbitrary code outside of the php runtime in the context of the apache process would allow the attacker to call change_hat().  - D  On Mon, May 18, at PM, Stanislav Malyshev <smalyshev@...il.com> wrote:  > Hi! > > > About code execution, I haven't had the chance to focus on actual > > exploitation yet (I surely will in the near future), but as you can see > > from the original report I > > pointed out several cases in which working on a so-crafted zval would > > lead to invalid memory access (with user controlled values as well), so > > I am pretty confident it is achievable. > > These examples all seem to require specific code (like > 'md5(str_repeat("a", to be run.
