Has nothing to do with the config (you may mix this up with another issue I recently reported to ssh regarding config parsing, but that's unrelated).  It's an OOB triggered in the client by a specific banner string from the server.  > Notices are already going up describing this as heap buffer overflow > with "high" risk.

One take away from this story for me - also after criticism I got on twitter: The term "heap overflow" seems to be prone for misunderstanding. Some people consider every out of bounds thing an "overflow", some think that only oob writes should be considered "overflows.  To avoid confusion I'll call similar issues "out of bounds read" instead of "read heap overflow" in the future. Probably a wording less prone to misunderstandings.  (address sanitizer calls every oob read a heap/stack/global buffer overflow, that is the main reason I used that term in the past - I often sticked to the wording address sanitizer used)   --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
