It is not used directly even for building qemu, used only by relevant maintainers when they update files in pc-bios/ which are produced from this set of sources.  If the bug is to be assigned, it should be filed against u-boot not qemu.  > ==================================================================== > ./roms/ipxe/src/util/niclist.pl:  The same thing, it is ipxe source, not used by qemu in any way.  > ==================================================================== >  > ./net/slirp.c: >     snprintf(s->smb_dir, sizeof(s->smb_dir), "/tmp/qemu-smb.%ld-%d", >              (long)getpid(), instance++);  This one is real, used for -smb argument, to start smbd, making its configuration.  Maybe tmpnam() should be used here.  > ==================================================================== > ./tcg/tcg.c: > #ifdef DEBUG_JIT >     /* Enable this block to be able to debug the ELF image file creation. >        One can use readelf, objdump, or other inspection utilities.  */ >     { >         FILE *f = fopen("/tmp/qemu.jit", "w+b"); >         if (f) { >             if (fwrite(img, img_size, 1, f) != img_size) { >                 /* Avoid stupid unused return value warning for fwrite.  */ >             } >             fclose(f); >         } >     } > #endif  This is solely for debugging by JIT maintainers.  Not useful for or used by users.   >From all the above, only net/slirp.c issue might be of interest.
