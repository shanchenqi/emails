This means that new lines, NULL byte and everything else can be encoded with base64 and are then inserted to logs as they are after decoding.  For example header "Authorization: Basic results in two log lines: " : is missing in test IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD "     Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
