Both of these CVEs are addressed in a single commit, that also covers few other functions not mentioned in either of the two bug reports (dir()/opendir() and chroot()).  Which CVE do those additional fixes fall under?  They are not 5.4 regressions, so probably not but maybe not under either given that bug only mentions pcntl_exec().   I think there are few fixes in / / that should have CVEs assigned:    More / / like issues.  More notes on what got changed is in RHBZ:    More unserialize issues.    Fileinfo DoS.   Can CVEs be assigned for these?
