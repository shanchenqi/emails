The issue:  I was forced to run hp-plugin to download a binary driver for the new printer, and I noticed this bit:    Downloading plug-in from:   Receiving digital keys: /usr/bin/gpg --homedir /home/enrico/.hplip/.gnupg --no-permission-warning --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys   Creating directory plugin_tmp   Verifying archive integrity... All good.  The use of a short key ID worries me, because it is now trivial to generate keys with arbitrary key IDs, and gpg --recv-keys will happily download all those it finds. Also, pgp.mit.edu is a keyserver where everyone can upload arbitrary keys.  You can run "gpg --recv to play with multiple keys having the same key ID.  I assume hp-plugin is open to downloading and verifying plugins signed by any key that one can verify that have that short key ID, and that with that and some fiddling with DNS one can cause systems running hp-plugin to download and run malicious code.  A quick fix would be to use the full fingerprint instead of the key id.
