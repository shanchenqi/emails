The issue has been fixed in Netty Netty Netty and Play Framework   Technical details of the vulnerability:  Many other projects using Netty may be vulnerable to similar "side­-effects" of the incorrect cookies parsing routine. We recommend that every project relying on Netty’s CookieDecoder method should mitigate the potential risk by upgrading to the latest version.
