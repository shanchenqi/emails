Clamav [0] is able to decrypt such files in order to scan them. As part of the decryptor there is an op code emulator. A special crafted file may contain a jump op code to a position that already has been interpreted - which leads to an endless loop. This leads to an endless loop in clamav itself.  This has been fixed by [1] and the loop limit has been increased in [2]. This change is part of the release.  This bug has been discovered by AFL [3], american fuzzy lop.
