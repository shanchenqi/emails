Clamav [1] is a virus scanning tool which is able to unpack such files during scanning.  During unpacking there are two range checks which are implemented "manually". Those checks lack the detection of overflows which are considered by the CLI_ISCONTAINED() macro. This has been fixed [2] and is part of the release. This bug has been discovered by AFL [3], american fuzzy lop.
