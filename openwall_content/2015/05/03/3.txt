Clamav [1] is a virus scanning tool which is able to unpack such files during scanning.  There are two issues: - There is a wrongly implemented range check. The size (of the memory) has   been fed as (j * 4) into the macro. With this written as-is the compiler   treats it as a "32 bit" operation and feeds the result into the macro. That   means the "64 bit" cast (to catch 32bit overflows) can not be performed   anymore. The result is a segfault. This has been fixed [2].  - A missing range check while invoking cli_rebuildpe(). A crafted file may   lead to reading more data from the file than memory has been allocated   leading to a crash. This has been fixed [3].  The two fixes are part of the release. Both bugs have been discovered by AFL [4], american fuzzy lop.
