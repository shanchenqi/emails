Clamav [1] is a virus scanning tool which is able to unpack such files during scanning.  Once the file has been identified as "petite" compressed before the decompressing process is started it is possible that a specially crafted file tells clamav to read more data than it allocated memory. On glibc it leads to SIGABRT on free() since glibc's malloc() recognizes this. A fix to this bug is part of the release.  This is a different issue than the one reported in This bug has been discovered by AFL [3], american fuzzy lop.
