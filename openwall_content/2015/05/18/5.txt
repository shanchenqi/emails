About code execution, I haven't had the chance to focus on actual  exploitation yet (I surely will in the near future), but as you can see  from the original report I  pointed out several cases in which working on a so-crafted zval would  lead to invalid memory access (with user controlled values as well), so  I am pretty confident it is achievable.
