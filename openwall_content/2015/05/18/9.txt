These examples all seem to require specific code (like 'md5(str_repeat("a", to be run. The probability that applications would contain this specific code with str_repeat argument controlled by remote user seems to be pretty low. However, if you can show exploiting this on a code of an application that is not specially crafted to demonstrate this issue, or at least resembles code that is likely to be deployed in a real application, I will gladly change my opinion.  --  Stas Malyshev smalyshev@...il.com  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
