Release Notes -- Apache Jackrabbit -- Version  Introduction ------------  This is Apache Jackrabbit(TM) a fully compliant implementation  of the Content Repository for Java(TM) Technology API, version 2.0 (JCR 2.0) as specified in the Java Specification Request (JSR  Apache Jackrabbit is a patch release that contains fixes and improvements over Jackrabbit Jackrabbit releases are considered stable and targeted for production use.  Security advisory / --------------------------------------------  This release fixes an important security issue in the jackrabbit-webdav  module reported by Mikhail Egorov.  When processing a WebDAV request body containing XML, the XML parser can be instructed to read content from network resources accessible to the host, identified by URI schemes such as "http(s)" or  "file". Depending on the WebDAV request, this can not only be used to trigger internal network requests, but might also be used to insert said content into the request, potentially exposing it to the attacker and others (for instance, by  inserting said content in a WebDAV property value using a PROPPATCH request). See also IETF RFC Section  Users of the jackrabbit-webdav module are advised to immediately update the module to this release or disable WebDAV access to the repository. Users on earlier versions of Jackrabbit who are unable to upgrade to should apply the fix to the corresponding 2.x branch or disable WebDAV access until official releases of those earlier versions are available. Patches for 2.x branches are attached to the JIRA issue.
