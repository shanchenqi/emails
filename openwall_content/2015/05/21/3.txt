Red Hat has assigned to the following issue:  "The python-kerberos checkPassword() does verify that it actually spoke to a trusted KDC"  Upstream has not fixed it, rather documented the insecurity of the checkPassword() function. We feel that this is not a proper solution given the fact that the pykerberos fork of this library did fix this issue by adding KDC validation:   Red Hat bug:   -- Martin PrpiÄ / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
