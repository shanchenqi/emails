Fallback have been assigned CVE here before. As well, it is an openwall release.  I may be wrong and it could already be assigned one, but I don't see it.  --   Kash Pande   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
