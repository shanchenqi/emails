Upstream has no security address I can find, filing a GitHUB issue (what their wiki says to do) which is public so also posting here.  This is in the RHEL 7 version and upstream: ============================= ./channels/drdynvc/tsmf/tsmf_media.c:			snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "/tmp/FreeRDP_Frame_%d.ppm", frame_id);                 /* Dump a .ppm image for every 30 frames.
