To be honest, I would prefer if we just checked:  	if (elt->length < sizeof(struct oz_get_desc_rsp) + 1) 		return; 	data_len = elt->length - sizeof(struct oz_get_desc_rsp) + 1;  Shouldn't there be an upper bound on length?  Shigekatsu?  regards, dan carpenter  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
