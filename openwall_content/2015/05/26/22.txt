I'm talking about this:  # gcc -xc - -otest <<< 'main(int argc, char *argv[]){system(argv[1]);}' # chmod +s test # exit $ ls -l ./test /bin/sh lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 9 May 24 /bin/sh -> /bin/bash -rwsrwsr-x. 1 root root May 26 test $ ./test /bin/sh $ whoami saken  $ su Password: # ln -sf /bin/dash /bin/sh # exit $ ./test /bin/sh # whoami root   > No, bash does NOT drop privileges if ruid != euid when called as > sh either .

I believe that's what setuid()/seteuid()/setreuid() are for if you   really want to execute stuff as another user.  Setting setuid(0) before the system() call on my test and executing   /bin/sh (which is linked to bash) would drop me into a root shell.   This doesn't happen if there is no setuid(0) call. The same doesn't happen when /bin/sh is linked to dash, there is no   need for setuid(0), it will drop me instantly into a root shell.  ---------------------------------------------------------------- This message was sent using IMP, the Internet Messaging Program.
