However based on the fact that (the OpenSSH J-PAKE protocol) it seems that even if the code is not enabled by default, the fact that it exists is enough to qualify it for a CVE. So with this in mind I'm sending a CVE request in.  First example from each of the 3 files affected by the DEBUG_ASN1 tmp file issues (note: print_buffer_bin doesn't do anything clever to be safe):  =================================================== ./src/plugins/preauth/pkinit/pkinit_crypto_openssl.c =================================================== #ifdef DEBUG_ASN1     if (cms_msg_type == CMS_SIGN_CLIENT) {         print_buffer_bin(*signed_data, *signed_data_len,                          "/tmp/client_pkcs7_signeddata");     } else { --   =================================================== ./src/plugins/preauth/pkinit/pkinit_srv.c =================================================== #ifdef DEBUG_ASN1     print_buffer_bin(data->contents, data->length, "/tmp/kdc_as_req"); #endif --  ================================= ./src/plugins/preauth/pkinit/pkinit_clnt.c ================================= #ifdef DEBUG_ASN1     print_buffer_bin((unsigned char *)coded_auth_pack->data,                      coded_auth_pack->length,                      "/tmp/client_auth_pack"); #endif --     --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
