I know that some people feel strongly about ROP opportunities and indirect calls, so they might want to comment (presumably on the glibc mailing list, libc-alpha).  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
