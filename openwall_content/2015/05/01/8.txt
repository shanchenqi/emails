I will only address an aspect that is on-topic here:  I've recently received an off-list inquiry from a company in this space (a "sanctioned MITM" software and appliance vendor) on how they can request distros list membership.  My reply included:  "According to what you wrote, Company Name should not be on distros, so I would recommend that you not make the request.  However, to have it fairly discussed (or not, as several of the recent on-hold requests haven't been discussed to a point of acceptance or rejection), and hopefully rejected, please feel free to post to the oss-security list."  This highlights that if/once we accept some closed source distro vendors to distros, the next round of headache will be inquiries/requests from vendors like these - and in fact at that point this won't seem as unreasonable as it does to me now.  This is (obvious and expected) slippery slope.  This makes me sad.
