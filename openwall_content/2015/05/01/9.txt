Using SSL/TLS in-house front ends is an entirely different animal than breaking up end-to-end TLS encryption into multi-segmented pathways via 3rd party interposition.  > We have had outsourcing of far more sensitive things for literally > centuries, e.g. legal and accounting firms, my lawyer and accountant > both have literally all my personal info and could easily destroy me > financially if they wanted to.

I think your analogies are confusing the incentives and priorities of different actors (service consumer, service provider, 3rd party contractor).  My own lawyer analogy crystalizes things a bit more clearly:  Say you called your lawyer's cell phone but unbeknownst to you she's been getting flooded by telemarkers. To help with this she's contracted a call service that screens her incomings and transparently relays valid calls. Maybe this service is trustworthy or maybe it just irreparably deep-sixed your attorney-client privilege. The clincher is without doing IMEI/TMSI analysis, you're unable to detect the interposition is even there. Moreover, while your connection to the call center is A5/1 protected, the call center might be relaying to your lawyer in the clear. You have no way of knowing from your end. s/lawyer/doctor/g etc.   > So in my opinion this is really nothing new, like any outsourced > activity pick your partners carefully. >  > This is me speaking on behalf of the Cloud Security Alliance: >  > Make your partners/vendors/etc. fill out at least the self attestation > level of STARS, which is free: >  > https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/star/self-assessment/ >  > If they refuse to do so that might be a good hint as to how secure > they really are.  Those are good suggestions for service providers seeking to outsource part of their processes but not so relevant to grandma e-banking or checking her medical results from her chalet in the Swiss Alps. As grannie is finding out, more and more sensitive transactions are being conducted over HTTPS these days. So, she's happy when she sees a lock in the url bar and gets no alerts from Firefox.   In recognition of this reality, browsers are assuming ever-increasing roles in safeguarding the security of their users. Traditional measures such as certificate validity checks and blocking weak primitives like small DH moduli and MD5 are constantly being augmented with innovations such as static pin lists, HKPK, etc. SSL/TLS libraries are similarly evolving.  It is in within this evolving context that the increasing usage of sanctioned TLS MITMs should be examined.    > -- Kurt Seifried  --mancha  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
