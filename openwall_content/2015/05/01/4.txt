Your security relies on the question how trustworthy these third parties are.  I don't see anything special here with outsourcing your server's TLS handling. Or anything special about cloudflare. When you outsource IT infrastructure you trust someone.  Just a thought experiment that has nothing to do with CDNs or TLS: Most medium or small Web services don't have their own datacenters. They have servers - either rented or their own - in a datacenter run by someone else. With physical access to the machine basically you can own them completely. There's almost nothing you can do to secure a machine where non-trustworthy people have physical access.  So I don't deny there are potential problems. But I don't see them as new or special.   --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
