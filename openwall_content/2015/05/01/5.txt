This is me speaking personally:  This is nothing new. Front end load balancers that handle SSL/TLS and then do HTTP on the backend have been around for decades. This is simply outsourcing it to a trusted (hopefully, because I use them!) party rather than doing it in house.  We have had outsourcing of far more sensitive things for literally centuries, e.g. legal and accounting firms, my lawyer and accountant both have literally all my personal info and could easily destroy me financially if they wanted to. But they don't because we have contracts, and more importantly contract enforcement in the form of a civil legal system (as does most of the world). The same applies for CloudFlare, Google (my email), and so on.  So in my opinion this is really nothing new, like any outsourced activity pick your partners carefully.  This is me speaking on behalf of the Cloud Security Alliance:  Make your partners/vendors/etc. fill out at least the self attestation level of STARS, which is free:  https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/star/self-assessment/  If they refuse to do so that might be a good hint as to how secure they really are.  > --mancha   --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
