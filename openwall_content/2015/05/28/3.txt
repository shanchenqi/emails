The MITRE CVE team currently prefers that this request not be re-sent as a separate message for each plugin.  > https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO#how-to-write-a-cve-request  That document is directly applicable to CVE request responses by Kurt Seifried (including the ones he sent to oss-security up until Although the document contains a large amount of useful information, it is not a document that has been reviewed by the MITRE CVE team. For the specific topic of WordPress plugins, we would typically need to know what privileges are required to conduct each attack and -- in situations with more than one security issue for a single plugin -- whether the vulnerabilities are independently exploitable.  > does not have enough information for CVE request  For the majority of the plugins, the amount of vulnerability detail is similar to the case that we discussed here last week. The situation isn't identical, so we'll try to clarify. As always, MITRE does not make decisions about the policies of the oss-security list. The current status is that nobody has objected to the message pattern starting with (for example) the post, in which version information was originally included and the vulnerability had already been fixed. The reporting pattern is not always the same. First, version information is not directly included. Second, some of the plugins apparently do not have a changelog entry indicating that any security problem was recently fixed. Putting all of this together, the most critical difference may be that some of these plugin reports are not about "Public security issues" and would potentially fall outside the scope of this list. So, our guess is that we can send a response here (with a CVE mapping) for a subset of this message, e.g.,      * extended-catagories-widget [PLUGINS] + url:     https://wordpress.org/plugins/extended-categories-widget/ +     vuln found: :--|- post auth admin SQLi  seems to map to this public issue:      https://wordpress.org/plugins/extended-categories-widget/changelog/        Last Updated:        Version        Post-Auth SQL Injection Vulnerability        Only occurs for WordPress versions lower than 3.3  but we must not send a response here (with a CVE mapping) for some of the other parts. If we have misinterpreted that, you can (among other options) send e-mail directly to only cve-assign@...re.org to tell us. We will leave it at that for now. There are obviously open questions, e.g., if someone prefers to send a very large number of low-information but public WordPress plugin findings, is it still best to use oss-security.  - -- CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =Sw75 -----END PGP SIGNATURE----- Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
