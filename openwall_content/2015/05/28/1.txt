Hard to read and does not have enough information for CVE request. One email with all needed details for CVE request per plugin is better way to get these assigned.  https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO#how-to-write-a-cve-request  Could you list affected versions? Could you provide proof-of-concept code or what file and parameter/function is affected? Have you reported these issues to plugins@...dpress.org?  There are plenty of good CVE requests for WordPress plugins in list archive. For example:  If you need any help please reply or contact me off-list for support.  - --  Henri Salo -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =w2CS -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
