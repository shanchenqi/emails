ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Error handling in the operation may involve handing back pages to the domain. This operation may fail when in parallel the domain gets torn down. So far this failure unconditionally resulted in the host being brought down due to an internal error being assumed. This is  Furthermore error handling so far wrongly included the release of a lock. That lock, however, was either not acquired or already released on all paths leading to the error handling sequence. This is  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest administrator may be able to deny service by crashing the host or causing a deadlock.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen versions from at least 3.2 onwards are vulnerable.  Older versions have not been inspected.  MITIGATION ==========  The vulnerability can be avoided if the guest kernel is controlled by the host rather than guest administrator, provided that further steps are taken to prevent the guest administrator from loading code into the kernel (e.g. by disabling loadable modules etc) or from using other mechanisms which allow them to run code at kernel privilege.  In Xen HVM, controlling the guest's kernel would involve locking down the bootloader.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Julien Grall of Citrix and Jan Beulich of SUSE.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.       xen-unstable, Xen 4.6.x, Xen 4.5.x, Xen 4.4.x, Xen 4.3.x  $  $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.   (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
