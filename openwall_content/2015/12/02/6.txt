This fallback is quite easy to be overlooked and it gives the opportunity for a DNS rebinding attacks against systems that use the service and have default credentials for a certain time window.  I've opened an issue on what appears to be the only maintained fork of shellinabox at this time:   Also we removed the package from the Debian image that we publish for the USB armory project (http://dev.inversepath.com/download/usbarmory/), here's the relevant CHANGELOG entry:  * security fix: removed shellinabox package    The shellinabox web server was originally added to ease connection on hosts   that do not have an SSH client. The server, while using the HTTPS protocol,   allows HTTP fallback through the "/plain" URL. This exposes the opportunity   for a potential DNS rebinding attack, by malicious JavaScript loaded in the   context of the user browser, that would allow connection to shellinabox in   the time window between server startup and user reconfiguration of default   credentials.    While the opportunity for a successful attack is quite limited, it is   nonetheless present. For this reason the shellinabox package is removed.
