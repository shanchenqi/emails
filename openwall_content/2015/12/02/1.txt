Guido Vranken reported several flaws to Ubuntu's launchpad bugtracker in the dhcpcd3 package that is shipped in Ubuntu, Debian, and potentially other distributions.   Guido included a patch along with AFL-discovered inputs to trigger the issues:    Roy Marples has already addressed these issues in upstream dhcpcd packages; I believe these issues may require CVE identifiers:    I believe this represents three distinct flaws: out of bounds reads beyond the end of the supplied packet, out of bounds write before the start of the 'out' parameter, and a use-after-free.  I brought this issue to the distros list on Wed, 18 Nov  Thanks  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
