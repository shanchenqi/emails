The case for considering this a shellinabox vulnerability report (rather than a shellinabox improvement suggestion) may be marginal.  We decided to assign for a vulnerability in shellinabox. This same CVE ID can be used by anyone (such as usbarmory) who makes a security announcement in direct response to the vulnerability, regardless of whether the announcement is about removing the package or changing the package.  The basic rationale is that 'allows HTTP fallback, even when configured for HTTPS, via the "/plain" URL' is apparently undocumented (and has the stated security risk). If there had been something in https://github.com/shellinabox/shellinabox/wiki/shellinaboxd_man or even a source-code comment saying why the behavior had been chosen despite the risk, the outcome may have been different. There are various other choices in shellinaboxd that may seem unusual to people unfamiliar with the product's use cases, e.g.,    Unless SSL certificates can be found in the current directory, the   daemon will automatically generate suitable self-signed   certificates. ... the use of auto-generated self-signed certificates   is intended for testing or in intranet deployments  (Someone could conceivably argue that "automatically generate" should not be a default behavior.)  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =fFkK -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
