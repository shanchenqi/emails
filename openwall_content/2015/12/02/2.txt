MITRE will assign CVE IDs. Do the above references mean that most of the changed code lines in dhcp.c.patch correspond to out-of-bounds reads shown in the diff, the change from "(l = *q++)" to "(l = *q++) && q - p < len" corresponds to an out-of-bounds write, the deletion of "free (dhcp->dnssearch)" corresponds to a use-after-free, and nothing else in the part of the http://roy.marples.name reference is a new vulnerability? (This is just a guess.)  The reason we're asking this and not immediately sending three CVE IDs is that someone at MITRE will ultimately use, or at least consider using, both and to describe what the CVEs mean. If there's already information about the equivalences between these references, that will make this process easier, and also further confirm that three IDs is the right number.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  r8NaHJ5vFJeH+sNqOhZf =jJ31 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
