But the memcpy(out,...) call does look like it'd also perform out-of-bounds writes.  > the deletion of "free > (dhcp->dnssearch)" corresponds to a use-after-free, and nothing else > in the part of the http://roy.marples.name reference is a new > vulnerability? (This is just a guess.)  I should point out that it's my summary that it's a use-after-free -- Guido said in his report that it is a double-free.  > The reason we're asking this and not immediately sending three CVE IDs > is that someone at MITRE will ultimately use, or at least consider > using, both and > > to describe what the CVEs mean.

I'm afraid the MITRE crew has a more difficult task than we do.
