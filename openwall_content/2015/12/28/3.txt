This affects the current development tree (which is the most used version of flexlay) as well as older releases. Reported in flexlay's issue tracker as #65 [2].  A CVE has previously been requested from secalert@...hat.com, however, they told me I should use this list as the FIXME comment [3] in the affected code is apparently public enough.
