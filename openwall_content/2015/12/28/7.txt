Having SSL 3.0 support enabled does not mean that a MITM attacker can force a downgrade to SSL 3.0.  The vulnerability response to POODLE was somewhat botched and initially did not fix the actual vulnerability (insecure protocol downgrade in web browsers).  I think as far as FLOSS is concerned, this has since been corrected, so offering SSL 3.0 support does not longer result in connections which are vulnerable to POODLE.  Clients which offered SSL 3.0 support but did not perform an out-of-protocol downgrade (like web browsers did) were not vulnerable, either.  > Looking up the documentation before I reply, it seems that by using the > SSL_OP_ALL setting, the mitigation you mention is actually disabled. See > SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS & SSL_OP_ALL on[1]  Yes, this is what my meant, the documented SSL_OP_ALL setting is not really safe.  But this is a different vulnerability from POODLE.
