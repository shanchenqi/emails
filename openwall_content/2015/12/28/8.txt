WebKit in Apple Safari before 7.x before and 8.x     before as used in iOS before and other products, does     not enforce the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) protection     mechanism for Content Security Policy (CSP) report requests, which     allows man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain sensitive information     by sniffing the network or spoof a report by modifying the client-     server data stream.
