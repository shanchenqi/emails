Use for the originally identified bug. We realize that, for example, http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/net/ipv4/af_inet.c has not yet been changed. If Linux kernel developers determine that multiple independent bugs result in situations where sk->sk_prot->get_port is NULL above, then it is possible that additional CVE IDs will be assigned later.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =KMi2 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
