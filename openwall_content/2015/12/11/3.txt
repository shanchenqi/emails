This whitepaper has a section discussing how one such vulnerability affected the 'mail' ruby gem (see section 3.1).  Whitepaper has all the specific details, but basically the 'mail' ruby gem module is prone to the recipient attack as it does not validate nor sanitize given recipient addresses. Thus, the attacks described in chapter 2 of the whitepaper can be applied to the gem without any modification. The 'mail' ruby gem itself does not impose a length limit on email addresses, so an attacker can send a long spam message via a recipient address unless there is a limit on the application's side. This vulnerability affects only the applications that lack input validation.  'mail' is a "A Really Ruby Mail Library" for Ruby.  Ruby gem: mail (https://rubygems.org/gems/mail) Affects: and earlier Fixed in: Fixed by  Can a CVE be assigned? Since the issue was fixed in not sure if that means it needs a era CVE or if a one will work since it wasn't found to be a vulnerability until this year.  Note, the paper author has informed me "BTW, while investigating the source code of Mail, I came to think the fault might be more on Net::SMTP's side. It is difficult to say who is responsible for it, Net::SMTP, Mail or application developers (library users) though."  Either way, vuln needs to be tracked, and a change in 'mail' did mitigate it for now (and affects all their delivery methods, not just 'smtp').
