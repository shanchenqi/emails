As far as we can tell, the unpatched code has    while (*kp == ' ')  and the patched code has    while (key_len && *kp == ' ')  See     Use  Any instance of "kp ==" instead of "*kp ==" would have been a different type of problem but we don't think that problem ever occurred.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  MHAIUGPZQf7YS/kpzTHE =h4md -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
