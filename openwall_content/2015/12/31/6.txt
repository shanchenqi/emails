Our understanding is that pngcrush is a command-line program, and that the bug is largely equivalent to a scenario in which the "-loco" functionality had not been implemented.  We probably would need a threat model in which the victim cannot recover from the attack by simply avoiding all subsequent use of the "-loco" option, e.g., a segfault that realistically could lead to code execution.  We also can't, for example, assign a CVE ID for a threat model in which an attacker constructs a huge PNG file in the hope that a victim may decide to try "pngcrush -loco" on it, and the segfault may cause the creation of a core file that consumes the victim's available disk space.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =NnqJ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
