(This is not yet available at http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/kernel/ptrace.c and might be the current end of the earlier discussion.)  This issue has been covered in security advisories from one or more Linux distributions, e.g.,  >> >>  >> Jann Horn discovered a ptrace issue with user namespaces in the Linux >> kernel. The namespace owner could potentially exploit this flaw by ptracing >> a root owned process entering the user namespace to elevate its privileges >> and potentially gain access outside of the namespace. >>   There has been some discussion of whether the finding was a vulnerability discovery, e.g.,  >>> Date: Fri, 18 Dec >>> From: Jann Horn <jann@...jh.net> >>>  >>> I'm not sure whether this is CVE-worthy - the user_namespaces >>> manpage says "the process has full privileges for operations >>> inside the user namespace, but is unprivileged for operations >>> outside the namespace". ptrace()ing a process in the >>> namespace can reasonably be considered an "operation inside >>> the user namespace" ... >>>  >>> In my opinion, this patch is somewhere between hardening and >>> a security feature, but I wouldn't really call it a vuln fix.   >>>> Date: Thu, 17 Dec >>>> From: Serge Hallyn <serge.hallyn@...ntu.com> >>>>  >>>>> ptrace()ing a process in the >>>>> namespace can reasonably be considered an "operation inside >>>>> the user namespace" >>>>  >>>> Except by creating a file in the host namespace, you were, as >>>> root in the container, able to escape your namespace, right?  We feel that, more generally, the mention of "and potentially gain access outside of the namespace" is a realistic concern.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =YkNx -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
