It seems best to > assign to the combination of the conv_jistoeuc, > conv_euctojis, and conv_sjistoeuc issues. [...]  Note that two of the bounds checks added in that commit are incorrect:  1. In conv_jistoeuc() the check uses > rather than <, which causes all    conversions to return an empty string.  This is presumably not a    security issue, but is a regression.  3. In conv_euctojis() the comparison is with outlen - 3, but each pass    through the loop uses up to 5 bytes and the rest of the function may    add another 4 bytes.  The comparison should presumably be     '<= outlen - 9' or equivalently '< outlen - 8'.  The first check is fixed by a later commit:  Ben.  --  Ben Hutchings All the simple programs have been written, and all the good names taken.
