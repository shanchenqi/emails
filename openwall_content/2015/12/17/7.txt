ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Single memory accesses in source code can be translated to multiple ones in machine code by the compiler, requiring special caution when accessing shared memory.  Such precaution was missing from the hypervisor code inspecting the state of I/O requests sent to the device model for assistance.  Due to the offending field being a bitfield, it is however believed that there is no issue in practice, since compilers, at least when optimizing (which is always the case for non-debug builds), should find it more expensive to extract the bit field value twice than to keep the calculated value in a register.  IMPACT ======  This vulnerability is exposed to malicious device models.  In conventional Xen systems this means the qemu which service an HVM domain.  On such systems this vulnerability can only be exploited if the attacker has gained control of the device model qemu via another vulnerability.  Privilege escalation, host crash (Denial of Service), and leaked information all cannot be excluded.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen versions are affected.  Only x86 variants of Xen are susceptible.  ARM variants are not affected.  Only HVM guests expose this vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only PV guests will avoid this issue.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk of Oracle and Jan Beulich of SUSE while investigating the issues arising from was discovered by Felix Wilhelm of ERNW.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            xen-unstable, Xen 4.6.x       Xen 4.5.x       Xen 4.4.x       Xen 4.3.x  $     $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.   (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)  For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information, consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:   http://www.xenproject.org/security-policy.html  NOTE REGARDING SHORT EMBARGO ============================  This issue was encountered by the Security Team during investigations of the scope and impact of  Accordingly is embargoed and the embargo will end at the same time as that of -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =Fovo -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
