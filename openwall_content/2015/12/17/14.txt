I'm not sure whether this is CVE-worthy - the user_namespaces manpage says "the process has full privileges for operations inside the user namespace, but is unprivileged for operations outside the namespace". ptrace()ing a process in the namespace can reasonably be considered an "operation inside the user namespace", and therefore the manpage kinda implies the old behavior. (Yes, more detailed documentation would be nicer, I might submit man-pages patches once my patches are in a kernel release.)  In my opinion, this patch is somewhere between hardening and a security feature, but I wouldn't really call it a vuln fix.
