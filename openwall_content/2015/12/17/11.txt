For example, part of the source code is:                  $fields->replaceField('Locale', new DropdownField (                         'Locale',                         $this->fieldLabel('Locale'),  In other words, mentioning "Locale" and "FailedLoginCount" does not mean that the number of known independent attack vectors is being increased from 2 to 4.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =v/y/ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
