However, we don't see an indication that these issues arose in independent ways. (Also, there is no vendor statement that conv_euctojis or conv_sjistoeuc is exploitable.) It seems best to assign to the combination of the conv_jistoeuc, conv_euctojis, and conv_sjistoeuc issues.   > This version also fixes two oob errors I reported, I don't think > they're security risks  There are currently no CVE IDs for these:       We think this might mean that there is a bug in code supporting   the UI, triggerable with UI interaction and not triggerable with   any untrusted input.        There isn't a statement of a security impact. If there is data loss   in a realistic scenario, then a CVE ID can be assigned. For example,   the user is in the middle of composition of a long outbound message   and pauses to read a new inbound message containing a   "List-Archive: <" line, and then there is a crash causing the entire   composition to be irretrievably lost.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  GvKWDNciI/GdMgvBe3hc =C4ff -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
