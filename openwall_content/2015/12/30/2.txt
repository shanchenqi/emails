The distributed replicated storage (DRBD) secret is leaked by the RAPI interface when job results are requested. Leveraging on the knowledge of this secret, a malicious user who had already gained access to the storage network of the cluster can retrieve instance data more easily and reliably.  The RAPI interface is also vulnerable to a DoS condition, triggered via SSL parameter renegotiation issued by a malicious client. The condition leads to resource exhaustion on the master node.  Affected version:  Ganeti  Fixed version:  Ganeti  Credit: vulnerability reported by Pierre Kim <pierre [dot] kim [dot] sec [at] gmail [dot] com>.
