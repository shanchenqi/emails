A malicious user with a local account may be able to escalate privileges and take control of local system by abusing the user key subsystem.  >From the patch:   -- If a user key gets negatively instantiated, an error code is cached in the payload area.  A negatively instantiated key may be then be positively instantiated by updating it with valid data.  However, the ->update key type method must be aware that the error code may be there. --  The paging address is predictable and mappable as userspace memory and can be used by abused by an attacker to escalate privileges.  This is not the same issue as this issue persists after the fix is applied.  I have only seen this affected on the 4.4  release candidates.
