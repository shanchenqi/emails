Extra information stored on parameters inherited by hosts in Foreman is shown in the web UI, in a popup for users.  The user-editable parts of this information, such as a description, matcher and source name can allow stored HTML/JS to be evaluated when a user opens the information popup for a parameter.  Thanks to Tomer Brisker for reporting it to the foreman-security team, and for fixing the issue.  Affects: at least Foreman and higher (all modern versions) Fix to be released in Foreman  Patch:  More information: http://theforeman.org/  - --  Dominic Cleal dominic@...al.org -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v2  =SfOR -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
