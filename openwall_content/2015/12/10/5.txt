ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Certain HYPERVISOR_memory_op subops take page order inputs, with so far insufficient enforcement of limits thereof. In particular, for all of XENMEM_increase_reservation, XENMEM_populate_physmap, and XENMEM_exchange the order was limited to 9 only for guests without physical devices assigned. Guests with assigned devices were allowed up to order 18 (x86) or 20 (ARM). XENMEM_decrease_reservation enforced only the latter, higher limit uniformly on all kinds of guests.  All of these operations involve loops over individual pages (possibly nested, with only the iteration count of the innermost loop being of interest here), resulting in iteration counts of up to 1 million on ARM. Total execution time of these operations obviously depends on system speed, but have been measured to get into the seconds range.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest administrator can cause a denial of service. Specifically, prevent use of a physical CPU for a significant period. Other attacks, namely privilege escalation, cannot be ruled out.  If a host watchdog (Xen or dom0) is in use, this can lead to a watchdog timeout and consequently a reboot of the host.  If another, innocent, guest, is configured with a watchdog, this issue can lead to a reboot of such a guest.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen versions supporting ARM are affected.  x86 versions of Xen are unaffected.  MITIGATION ==========  The vulnerability can be avoided if the guest kernel is controlled by the host rather than guest administrator, provided that further steps are taken to prevent the guest administrator from loading code into the kernel (e.g. by disabling loadable modules etc) or from using other mechanisms which allow them to run code at kernel privilege.  On ARM, controlling the guest's kernel may involve locking down the bootloader.  Exposure may be limited by not passing through physical devices to untrusted guests.  (However, where device pass-through is being used to enhance security, for example, by disaggregating device drivers, users should not change their configuration: moving the drivers from a separate domain, to dom0, does NOT mitigate this vulnerability.  Rather, it simply recategorises the additional exposure, regarding it "as designed" and therefore "not a bug".  Users and vendors of disaggregated systems should not change their configuration.)  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Julien Grall of Citrix.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.  Note that the patches provided with previous versions of this advisory had two problems:   - The bounding for ordinary DomU and DomU with pass-through devices(s)    was swapped.  This would result in non-pass-through domains being able    to perform operations with larger than intended order.  In the default    configuration this higher limit is not sufficient to reopen the    security issue.  However, users of the new memop-max-order option    may be vulnerable, depending on the limits they specify.   - On 4.4 and earlier, the relevant patch does not compile on ARM.  The supplementary patch fixes these problems on all listed versions.   In summary:           } xen-unstable, Xen 4.6.x, Xen 4.5.x      }    apply both patches       } Xen 4.4.x, Xen 4.3.x      }    apply both patches   $    $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the PATCH (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.   However deployment of the NO PASS-THROUGH partial MITIGATION is NOT permitted (except where all the affected systems and VMs are administered and used only by organisations which are members of the Xen Project Security Issues Predisclosure List).  Specifically, deployment on public cloud systems is NOT permitted.  This is because altering the set of devices observable in a guest in connection with a security issue would be a user-visible change which could lead to the rediscovery of the vulnerability.  Deployment of the mitigation is permitted only AFTER the embargo ends.   Also: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.   (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
