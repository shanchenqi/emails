I was not able to find an already-assigned CVE-ID for this.  A flaw was found in the overlay filesystem of the Linux kernel which allows an unprivileged user to change attributes of the files in the overlay, particularly allowing access to root-only-accessible files like '/etc/shadow'.  References:  - Red Hat public Bugzilla  - an upstream Linux kernel commit fixing the issue.
