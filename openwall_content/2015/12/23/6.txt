We strongly recommend to upgrade the older installation to this latest version as soon as possible."  Given nghttp2 is used for many (most?) http2 deployments and these become more and more common I think this is rather serious.  --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
