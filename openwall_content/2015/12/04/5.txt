This is valid in but allowing such addresses resulted in invalid SMTP commands, permitting a kind of message injection attack. These addresses were allowed by the pcre8 validator pattern (the default in recent PHP versions). This has been mitigated by rejecting line breaks during address validation, and also by rejecting line breaks in SMTP commands, which addresses the problem for applications using the SMTP class directly."  Fixed in PHPMailer  My (non-authoritative) guess for a CVSSv3 score: Base Score: 3.7 (Low) Temporal Score: 3.2 (Low) Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N/E:U/RL:O/RC:C  Thanks, Gsunde  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
