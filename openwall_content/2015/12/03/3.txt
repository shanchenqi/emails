Link to the paper published on USENIX Security  Intel published a security advisory on that issue:  Could you please allocate a CVE id for this? Below are fixes from major SRIOV vendors.    Intel published fixed drivers on kernel.org: ixgbe: add flow control ethertype to the anti-spoofing filter commit  Add a workaround to drop all flow control frames commit    Qlogic(ex Broadcom controllers) recently pushed the fix upstream. There is patch which pushed the new FW: And another which changed the driver to employ it:  This is the header of the driver patch: Commit "bnx2x: Add FW added said .bin FW to linux-firmware; This patch incorporates the FW in the bnx2x driver.   - Prevent VFs from sending MAC control frames; FW would treat a VF sending such a packet as malicious and block any further communication done by the VF.    Mellanox also provided fix in firmware for ConnectX-3 devices. Fixed firmware version   Thanks, Igor Smolyar  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
