If a given kernel supports CLONE_NEWUSER then everybody can create SOCK_RAW sockets. And CLONE_NEWUSER seems to be enabled with most modern Linux distros.  b). .. could simply crash the kernel ..  It'll cause GPF in the supervisor mode, and it seems that with most of supported CPU architectures under Linux, this will actually cause SIGSEGV to be sent to the user-land counterpart of the kernel thread which caused such GPF. So, it's not really crash of the kernel in most cases (may depend on sysctl and CPU architecture in use though). However, given that such GPF can happen when the socket struct seems to be locked, this could potentially cause some kernel dead-locks with subsequent accesses to sk (may result in unkillable processes and similar artifacts)  Also, it could be potentially turned into a privilege escalation problem if there was a way to map the NULL page. Under I reviewed the code (install_special_mapping() and friends from mmap.c) and it seems to be correctly protected. But if anybody is using any alternative CPU architecture, I'd suggest looking at their arch-specific vdso/vvar mapping code. In case the address is controllable by user, this could likely allow for mapping of the NULL page and pwning the kernel.
