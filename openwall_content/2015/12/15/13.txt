In case there was interest in this report of a possibly unexpected PAM behavior: the MITRE CVE team has no current plans to assign a CVE ID. This seems to be essentially a design issue where multiple valid opinions may exist. In other words, if /etc/shadow is in an incorrect state, possibly the ideal outcome would be to halt the system until it can be recovered using console access, possibly the ideal outcome is to let the system continue running with otherwise normal software behaviors in case an authorized user is relying on those behaviors to fix the problem, or possibly it's something in between. Another example would be a case where /etc/shadow is not critically misconfigured (e.g., owned by the man account) but only slightly misconfigured (e.g., the root group has read access). Some people may prefer a design in which password-based authentication always fails until the permissions are fixed; however, that's not necessarily the prevailing opinion.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =Z+Rm -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
