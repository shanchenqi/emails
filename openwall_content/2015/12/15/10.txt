This patch fixes both these issues to avoid >> host memory leakage.  This is not yet available at http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=history;f=hw/net/vmxnet3.c but that may be an expected place for a later update.  "does not check if the device is active before activating it" seems to be similar to a ("Incomplete Internal State Distinction") issue. Use for this aspect of the report.  "did not free the transmit & receive buffers while deactivating" seems to be similar to a ("Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime") issue. Use for this aspect of the report.   >> I've added a check in vmxnet3_deactivate_device() to avoid double free.  We think this may mean that the double free existed only in an early version of the patch, and did not exist in any shipped QEMU code. There is no CVE ID for the double free.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =Egny -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
