The problem with the initial shlex.quote upstream patch is that it's only available in certain Python versions (introduced with 3.3?). While this would provide sufficient protection for Python versions with shlex.quote, older Python versions would throw an error when trying to interpret the relevant code section.  The updated Fedora packages use yet another patch, which checks if shlex.quote is available and uses pipes.quote as fallback alternative, so Fedora does not need a new CVE.
