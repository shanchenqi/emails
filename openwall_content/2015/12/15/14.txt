This can trigger a REQUIRE assertion    failure when those records are subsequently cached. Intentional    exploitation of this condition is possible and could be used as    a denial-of-service vector against servers performing recursive    queries.  Impact:     An attacker who can cause a server to request a record with a    malformed class attribute can use this bug to trigger a REQUIRE    assertion in db.c, causing named to exit and denying service to    clients.  The risk to recursive servers is high. Authoritative    servers are at limited risk if they perform authentication when    making recursive queries to resolve addresses for servers listed    in NS RRSETs.
