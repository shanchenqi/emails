I believe the first five issues should have CVE's assigned. The last issue requires that the organization running the wiki also releases detailed page view data publicly, and probably not worth tracking with a CVE. However I'm happy for mitre to assign one of they think this generally qualifies.  * XSS from wikitext when $wgArticlePath='$1'. Internal review discovered an XSS vector when MediaWiki is configured with a non-standard configuration.  * User::matchEditToken should use constant-time string comparison. Internal review discovered that tokens were being compared as strings, which could allow a timing attack. This should possibly have 2 CVE's assigned, one for the original patch to use hash_equals in (released as part of MediaWiki and backported to and as part of this patch) and one to fix related to the debugging statement.  * Error thrown by VirtualRESTService when POST variable starts with '@'. Internal review discovered that MediaWiki was not sanitizing parameters passed to the curl library, which could cause curl to upload files from the webserver to an attacker.  * Passwords generated by User::randomPassword() may be shorter than $wgMinimalPasswordLength. MediaWiki user Frank R. Farmer reported that the password reset token could be shorter than the minimum required password length.  * Incorrect parsing of IPs for global block. Wikimedia steward Vituzzu reported that blocking IP addresses with zero-padded octets resulted in a failure to block the IP address.  * A combination of Special:MyPage redirects and pagecounts allows an external site to know the wikipedia login of an user. Wikimedia user Xavier Combelle reported a way to identify user, when detailed page view data is also released.
