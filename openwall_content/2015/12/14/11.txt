The first one mentions a CVE ID from Ubuntu, but doesn't yet exist. Possibly the CVE ID is supposed to be for use of "chown man" in /etc/cron.daily/man-db within both Ubuntu and Debian distributions.  The second one doesn't mention any CVE ID. Would it be useful for MITRE to assign a CVE ID for the permissions/ownerships error of:    drwxr-sr-x 25 man root May 15 /var/cache/man  ? Our understanding is that this is, more or less, currently unsupported by the Linux kernel. In other words, it is not valid to choose that specific set of permissions/ownerships if one is concerned about an attack by someone with the uid of the man account. This issue affects both Ubuntu and Debian distributions.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =lZEJ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
