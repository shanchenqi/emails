The logs may also be forwarded to other places (possibly in clear text)" scenario, at least, seems relevant.  In general, an issue with unlogged private data on a command line sometimes does not have a CVE ID, if the command line only occurs during initial installation of a machine, before any unprivileged user accounts would have access. (We don't know enough about the use cases to determine whether that sometimes applies to chef.)   > I can't recall but I suspect this is also a problem with the > validatorless bootstrapping as well, which copies client.pem up to the > node instead validation.pem.  We aren't assigning a CVE ID for a "can't recall but I suspect this is also a problem" report. If there is a second vulnerability disclosed by lamont-granquist, then there should be a second CVE ID.   > >  > creates private files via here-doc cat(1)ing followed by running > chmod(1) and setting the permissions. >  > This is a race condition if the default umask creates files world- or > group-readable (as is almost universally the case).  was linked from If there is a race-condition vulnerability disclosed in we may be able to assign a CVE ID.
