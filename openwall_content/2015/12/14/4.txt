This is completely insane for a wide variety of reasons; there are quite a few ways of abusing this to elevate privileges.  This commit fixes the issue in Gentoo: commit message contains a TOCTOU PoC.  Can we get a CVE for this blunder?  Other distributions - you might want to double check that you're not making a similar mistake.  I have no idea if QEMU upstream recommends suid/fscaps in some documentation, or something similar, in which case that'll need to be changed.  Thanks, Jason  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
