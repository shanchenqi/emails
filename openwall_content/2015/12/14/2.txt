It occurs when the controller attempts to write to the  pending bit array(PBA) memory region. Because the MSI-X MMIO support did not  define the .write method.  A privileges used inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process  resulting in DoS issue.  Upstream fix: -------------    ->  has been assigned to this issue by Red Hat Inc.
