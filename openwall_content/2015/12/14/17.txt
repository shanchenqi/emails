Here's a better upstream patch  As far as we can tell, the old patch used shlex.quote whereas the new patch has a different solution involving subprocess.Popen. If had a vulnerability because shlex.quote didn't adequately protect against command injection, then there should be a second CVE ID for that vulnerability. Otherwise, we'll interpret "old patch caused problems" to mean usability problems.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =sPew -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
