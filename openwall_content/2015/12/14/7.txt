I found two issues in the version of bee2 crypto library that  can be found at https://github.com/agievich/bee2. The library implements  cryptographic algorithms standardized in Belarus and it is maintained by  Belarussian State University. The first iisue is possible leakage of sensitive data, the report can be  found at https://github.com/agievich/bee2/issues/5  Another one is memory leak that can lead to DoS, the report can be found  at https://github.com/agievich/bee2/issues/6 The both vulnerabilities were reported to maintainers and were fixed  several days ago. Please assign CVE IDs for these bugs if you think they are worth it in  this case (right now the library is'n very popular though it can be used  in some proprietary software). -- LL  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
