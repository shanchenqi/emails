The reason is that 'knife bootstrap' constructs a shell command to run on the node from a template, filling the private key in as a here-doc (see This command is invoked via (more or less):  ssh node 'sudo sh -c full-command-goes-here'  As a result, the private key ends up on the command-line, in the process table, and, by way of sudo command logging on most reasonable systems, in the system logs. The logs may also be forwarded to other places (possibly in clear text), and possible stored on other systems, making the private validator key not quite so private any more.  This issue was reported to Opscode here:  Opscode has elected not to request a CVE for this issue (nor fixed it; a work-around using so-called validatorless bootstrapping exists).  I think it would still be useful to have a CVE identifier for this issue.  -Jan  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
