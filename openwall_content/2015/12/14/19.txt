It's possible that Chef is installed/bootstrapped on a system that is already configured/set-up and used by other users.  User management may be done entirely outside of Chef, so that there is no universal guarantee that Chef would only ever be installed when no other unprivileged users would have access to the system (even if that is likely to be the majority of the use cases).  > > > >  > > creates private files via here-doc cat(1)ing followed by running > > chmod(1) and setting the permissions. > >  > > This is a race condition if the default umask creates files world- or > > group-readable (as is almost universally the case). >  > was linked from If there is a race-condition vulnerability > disclosed in we may be able to assign a CVE ID.

As above: no such guarantee, even though most people may well bootstrap Chef only in such environments.  -Jan  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
