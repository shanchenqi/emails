Nope, it is not a vulnerability specific to OpenSSL, but a design weakness in the SSLv3 protocol - so all implementations of SSLv3 are affected. I would use the same for all software that still uses SSLv3. This is different to "POODLE TLS", where some implementations (but not OpenSSL) contained a similar vulnerability in their implementation of the TLS 1.0 protocol (although the TLS 1.0 standard itself does not have it). In this case different CVE IDs are suggested - see Mitre's statement at [1] "POODLE TLS" is references in multiple CVEs, see [2]  [1] [2] https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/search-results?query=poodle%20tls  >  >  > It turns out that CoovaChilli is vulnerable to POODLE & I'd >  > like to follow the correct procedure regarding disclosure.

No - see above...  Gsunde   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
