We don't know of any relationship between any Magento .swf file and any YUI .swf file, and therefore there is a new CVE. For reference, other .swf filenames associated with YUI 2.x are YUIBridgeProject.swf, charts.swf, connection.swf, datastore.swf, and swfstore.swf.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =Eg7t -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
