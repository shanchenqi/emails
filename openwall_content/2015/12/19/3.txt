A fix is available at and should apply cleanly to all versions of Mono you might care about.  This fix should be applied to all Mono packages prior to 4.2 (everything except Debian Unstable, Ubuntu and Arch, from a quick look)  Attached is the disclosure as-received by us, which includes a minimal test case to demonstrate the vulnerability.  Thanks to Peter McLarnan <Peter.McLarnan@...group.trust> and Andy Schmitz <andy.schmitz@...group.trust>  Apologies for the lateness in sending this, I sent it to the wrong list & didn't notice until pointed out to me recently. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v2  =uXMH -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  View attachment "mono_disclosure.txt" of type "text/plain" bytes)  Download attachment "mono_disclosure.txt.sig" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
