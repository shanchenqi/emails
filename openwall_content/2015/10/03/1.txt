Historically, there have been very few, or perhaps no, other research reports that identified this volume of distinct bugs and presented the findings as a complex set of interrelationships among the bugs.  2. Ideally, we would model this in the normal way (e.g., by identifying primary and resultant weaknesses); however, it is possible that we will choose a different approach so that something loosely resembling a CVE mapping will be available sooner (and remain the final CVE mapping for this one report).  3. With either of those two options, we feel it is unlikely that the set of CVE IDs would correspond directly to the labels used in the report.  4. We have been studying some parts of the report and have reached a tentative conclusion that the use-after-free bug is probably the most important issue (or among the most important issues) for actual OpenSMTPD users, because of its role in enabling remote code execution. At present, this issue has a CVE ID; the remainder of the report does not yet have a CVE mapping, and we will send another message here when we have chosen a CVE mapping for it.  Specifically, for this finding:    - In the IMSG_{SMTP,MTA}_SSL_VERIFY case, PROC_LKA does not reset the     static pointer req_ca_vrfy_{smtp,mta} to NULL after free(), but trusts     PROC_PONY to always send an IMSG_{SMTP,MTA}_SSL_VERIFY_CERT (which     re-initializes this static pointer) before sending an     IMSG_{SMTP,MTA}_SSL_VERIFY{_CHAIN,} (use-after-free  use  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =p4wc -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
