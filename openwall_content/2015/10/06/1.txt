The URLs that submodules use may come 	   from arbitrary sources (e.g., .gitmodules files in a remote 	   repository), and can hurt those who blindly enable recursive 	   fetch. Restrict the allowed protocols to well known and 	   safe ones.  The following commits appear to implement the restrictions:   I do not know if this is exhaustive.  The announcement also mentions some int-based overflows but does not describe any situations that would allow crossing privilege boundaries.  Please assign CVEs as appropriate.
