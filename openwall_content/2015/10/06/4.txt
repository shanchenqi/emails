Details as follows:  It is possible for a guest issuing QXL commands to host to allow reading and writing host memory in a range of about The guest can create a surface very large (say x If width * height overflow the 32 bit and became a small number the host will accept the command and will create the surface. Now guest can copy areas of surfaces to access any area of memory covered by the image. Considering overflows, pixman implementation and image formats (32 bit, top-down or down-top) the range (the guest pass an offset into video memory for the start) the range if about +/- 8gb.   We have assigned  to this issue.
