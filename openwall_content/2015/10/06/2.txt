If the new sample format is smaller than the old one, there is a 	risk of buffer overflow: e.g. when the input file has 16-bit 	samples and the output file has 8-bit samples, afReadFrames will 	treat the buffer to read the samples (argument void *data) as a 	pointer to int16_t instead of int8_t, therefore it will write past 	its end.  He proposed a solution and test case to the Audio File library: https://github.com/mpruett/audiofile/pull/25/files  Please assign a CVE as appropriate.
