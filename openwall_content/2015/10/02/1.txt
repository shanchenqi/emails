Issues fixed in this release (since ===========================================  - - an oversight in the portable version of fgetln() that allows attackers   to read and write out-of-bounds memory;  - - multiple denial-of-service vulnerabilities that allow local users to   kill or hang OpenSMTPD;  - - a stack-based buffer overflow that allows local users to crash   OpenSMTPD, or execute arbitrary code as the non-chrooted _smtpd user;  - - a hardlink attack (or race-conditioned symlink attack) that allows   local users to unset the chflags() of arbitrary files;  - - a hardlink attack that allows local users to read the first line of   arbitrary files (for example, root's hash from /etc/master.passwd);  - - a denial-of-service vulnerability that allows remote attackers to fill   OpenSMTPD's queue or mailbox hard-disk partition;  - - an out-of-bounds memory read that allows remote attackers to crash   OpenSMTPD, or leak information and defeat the ASLR protection;  - - a use-after-free vulnerability that allows remote attackers to crash   OpenSMTPD, or execute arbitrary code as the non-chrooted _smtpd user;   References: [0]  - --  - ---------------------------- Kristian Fiskerstrand Blog: http://blog.sumptuouscapital.com Twitter: @krifisk - ---------------------------- Public OpenPGP key at hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net fpr:94CB AFDD 35AA 0B7F E3ED FAE3 - ---------------------------- "Excellence is not a singular act but a habit.
