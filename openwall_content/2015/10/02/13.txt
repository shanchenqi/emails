We have decided to choose the option of a single CVE, although this option is unattractive for some reasons. Use for the ("Algorithmic Complexity") issue in versions and earlier. In other words, we consider to be an affected version because there are realistic cases in which COMMENT_NEST_LEVEL must be 2 for usability reasons. There is no CVE ID corresponding to the behavior change between and  Looking at the first example from our previous reply:    jsmit@...ine.microsoft.com (Jan Smith (MSFT))  has a name field of "Jan Smith" in level 2 but a name field of "jsmit" in level 1. However,    jsmit@...ine.microsoft.com (Jan Smith)  has a name field of "Jan Smith" in both level 2 and level 1. The documentation for the name instance method says:    This method tries very hard to determine the name belonging to the   address. First the "phrase" is checked. If that doesn't work out   the "comment" is looked into.  The comment field of "(Jan Smith (MSFT))" is a real-life example and doesn't seem inherently complicated, so we feel that the documented "tries very hard" behavior is no longer provided if level 1 is used. As an example, Email::Address->parse might be used only on the "From" line to support an application that really, really wants to print:     Dear Jan Smith,       Thank you for opening a ticket.  instead of     Dear jsmit,       Thank you for opening a ticket.  It is, of course, not the CVE project's role to offer advice on whether to update. In practice, though, if there were a CVE stating "before as the affected versions, then (because exists) many people would update to resolve the CVE. It would fix a denial-of-service problem for anyone who is actually attacked, but potentially add a usability problem for a much larger population.  Finally, if anyone is planning to actually fix the issue, note that the problem might occur only with a list of addresses, as shown in the address-line attachment in the original CVE request. None of the four addresses by itself requires much CPU time.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  TpZM2oVjUrN/Zbgnmgni =EqLL -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
