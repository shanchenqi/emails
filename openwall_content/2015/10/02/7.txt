By deleting images that are being uploaded using a token that is about to expire, a malicious user can overcome the storage quota and accumulate untracked image data in the backend resulting in potential resource exhaustion and denial of service. All Glance setups using the V1 API are affected and all setups using the V2 API with the registry db_api enabled are affected.
