Description ===========  HTTP header injection was possible in login-related code of Kallithea, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary headers into the server responses.  The vulnerability affects the `came_from` `GET` parameter.  Example of a malicious request:      GET HTTP/1.1     Host:     Content-Length: 0     Cache-Control: max-age=0     Accept:     Origin:     Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1     User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) (KHTML, like Gecko)     Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded     Referer:     Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate     Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8     Cookie:  Corresponding response:      HTTP/1.1 Found     Cache-Control: no-cache     Content-Length:     Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8     Date: Mon, 21 Sep GMT     Location:     X-Forwarded-Host: http://zeroscience.mk     Location: http://zeroscience.mk     Pragma: no-cache     Server: waitress      <html>      <head>       Found</title>      </head>      <body>       Found</h1>       The resource was found at <a     X-Forwarded-Host: http://zeroscience.mk     Location: http://zeroscience.mk     X-Forwarded-Host: http://zeroscience.mk     Location: http://zeroscience.mk </a>;     you should be redirected automatically.        </body>     </html>  Impact ======  The bug allows an attacker to override important response headers, possibly redirecting users to a malicious website or make other middleware misbehave when it trusts the response headers.  Resolution ==========  The Kallithea project has fixed this issue in the stable branch. Users are recommended to upgrade to the latest 0.3 release.  Affected versions =================  The issue is present in Kallithea versions before 0.3.  Acknowledgments ===============  Thanks to Gjoko Krstic of Zero Science Lab for reporting this issue.
