By default, the MTA operates in local-mode only accepting connections on the loopback interface and through the unix socket. This is also true on OpenSMTPD -portable.  Not to mention that remote vulnerabilities only affect a process that is unprivileged and that the local vulnerabilities, as far as I know, don't allow for privileges escalation, only leaking of a hash (yes, it is bad, but you don't suddenly compromise the machine either).   > CCing the OpenSMTPD mailing list (low-volume; don't worry Solar!) in > case they want to chime in too. >   I'll chime in.  As we made clear in the commits and release note these issues were found by Qualys Security during an audit, for which they're going to publish a detailed advisory (very good read) with CVE associated to each issue.    > ---------- Forwarded message ---------- > From: Gilles Chehade <gilles@...lp.org> > Date: Fri, Oct 2, at AM > Subject: Announce: OpenSMTPD released > To: misc@...nsmtpd.org >  > [...snip...] >  >  > Issues fixed in this release since > =========================================== >  > - an oversight in the portable version of fgetln() that allows attackers >   to read and write out-of-bounds memory; >  > - multiple denial-of-service vulnerabilities that allow local users to >   kill or hang OpenSMTPD; >  > - a stack-based buffer overflow that allows local users to crash >   OpenSMTPD, or execute arbitrary code as the non-chrooted _smtpd user; >  > - a hardlink attack (or race-conditioned symlink attack) that allows >   local users to unset the chflags() of arbitrary files; >  > - a hardlink attack that allows local users to read the first line of >   arbitrary files (for example, root's hash from /etc/master.passwd); >  > - a denial-of-service vulnerability that allows remote attackers to fill >   OpenSMTPD's queue or mailbox hard-disk partition; >  > - an out-of-bounds memory read that allows remote attackers to crash >   OpenSMTPD, or leak information and defeat the ASLR protection; >  > - a use-after-free vulnerability that allows remote attackers to crash >   OpenSMTPD, or execute arbitrary code as the non-chrooted _smtpd user; >  > --  > You received this mail because you are subscribed to misc@...nsmtpd.org > To unsubscribe, send a mail to: misc+unsubscribe@...nsmtpd.org >   --  Gilles Chehade  https://www.poolp.org                                          @poolpOrg  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
