On further investigation by the security team, more vulnerabilities were found.  There are no CVEs.

They do not have the people to address the problem and aren't very interested in it(we've tried coordinating). It is a Zope2 issue vulnerability.

After testing, we knew that our automatic CSRF protection also addressed the reported CSRF issue.  is the first public announcement that Zope2 is mostly unprotected. Zope2 has a collection of management interfaces, many of which are vulnerable.   > > - -- > CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority > M/S > Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA > [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] > -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- > Version: GnuPG v1 > > > > > > > > > > > > > > =tvlJ > -----END PGP SIGNATURE----- >   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
