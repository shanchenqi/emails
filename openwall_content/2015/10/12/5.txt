The vulnerability information can be covered in CVE; however, we do not really understand why it is being presented in this way.  https://github.com/plone/plone4.csrffixes says "there are a lot of CSRF problem with the ZMI that Zope2 will never be able to fix." It seems that, normally, if one or more persons had discovered CSRF problems in Zope2, then they could have CVE IDs for their discoveries. Why is this a "never be able to fix" situation? Is there, more or less, a requirement that Zope2 allow arbitrary requests from clients that have never previously read the content of any web page, because of the variety of ways that Zope2 is used? In that situation, the request behavior of Zope2 would not necessarily be considered a Zope2 vulnerability.  Also, a separate issue is that the CVE request is specifically about backporting. It seems that, at some time in the past, the possibility of CSRF attacks against default Plone sites was identified and this motivated the development of auto CSRF protection in Plone 5. Normally, an assignment of a CVE ID or IDs would be associated with the original discovery, not a later backporting of fixes. Are these equivalent in this case: for example, were all of the CSRF attack possibilities against default Plone sites discovered by Plone Foundation contributors, and is the first general public announcement that these CSRF issues existed at all?  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =tvlJ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
