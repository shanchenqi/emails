This is a situation in which there may be multiple valid perspectives. What we're going to do is assign a CVE ID to the Fedora package for the use of --enable-bdjava at a time when there had not been an upstream release with default support for BD-J. Use  The upstream default was changed here:     on Default support for BD-J was present in (released but not in (released https://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/libbluray/ doesn't list any releases between these.  In the configure script has:    --enable-bdjava         enable BD-Java support (default is no)  under "Optional Features" but we didn't find any documentation or comments suggesting that --enable-bdjava was recommended for general use cases at that time. Apparently, BDJSecurityManager development came after  In other words, our perspective is that the primary known mistake is that the Fedora packaging process chose a non-standard default behavior, and either didn't investigate or didn't document the risks. If anyone else independently chose --enable-bdjava for their package based on or earlier, then they can have their own CVE ID.  On the question of whether CVE IDs can be assigned for an upstream BDJSecurityManager error (or omission), we don't currently know. Certainly if the upstream documentation announced that the product was intended for arbitrary untrusted Blu-ray content, then any security-relevant behavior would be a vulnerability. Blu-ray content is designed to be (in some senses, but maybe not all arbitrary senses) executable content. suggests an original upstream goal of handling trusted content in which the Java code is trusted Java code. Accordingly, it seems reasonable to interpret BDJSecurityManager as a work in progress. The existence of later releases doesn't mean they have announced that they are finished. For the general case of attacks that use media content, the CVE assignment process has an expectation that untrusted content may occur; however, any known upstream goal is always considered (also, the situation details are unusual here because the attack relies on Java, not memory safety in handling audio/video data).  Similarly, mentions (among its other findings) "Many physical players have settings to prevent discs from accessing the Internet for privacy reasons." If a device's documentation stated that the Internet would never be accessed, and the observed behavior were that the Internet is accessed, then there could be a CVE.  Finally, we do realize that:    has different reports.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  bsYTn+migyn5VAM7KUtt =HNXo -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
