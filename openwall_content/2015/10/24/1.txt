Fuzzing the exfatfsck with american fuzzy lop led to the discovery of a write heap overflow and an endless loop.  Especially at risk are systems that are configured to run filesystem checks automatically on external devices like USB flash drives.  A malformed input can cause a write heap overflow in the function verify_vbr_checksum. It might be possible to use this for code execution.  Upstream bug report https://github.com/relan/exfat/issues/5  Sample file triggering the bug https://crashes.fuzzing-project.org/exfatfsck-heap-overflow-write-verify_vbr_checksum  Git commit for fix  Another malformed input can cause an endless loop, leading to a possible denial of service.  Upstream bug report https://github.com/relan/exfat/issues/6  Sample file triggering the bug https://crashes.fuzzing-project.org/exfatfsck-endless-loop  Git commit of fix  Both issues have been fixed in the latest release of exfat-utils.  --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
