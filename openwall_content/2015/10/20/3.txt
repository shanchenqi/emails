Use  indicates that the without-random-IV behavior was intentional within sqlalchemy-utils itself. Also, the sqlalchemy-utils documentation apparently doesn't advertise any specific security properties for its encryption. For example:    http://sqlalchemy-utils.readthedocs.org/en/latest/data_types.html#module-sqlalchemy_utils.types.encrypted  just says "provides a way to encrypt and decrypt values." If it had stated "encrypt and decrypt values with AES," then there might have been a reasonable argument that random-IV behavior is required, i.e., otherwise, a user's expectations about standard practices wouldn't be satisfied. In other words, the sqlalchemy-utils documentation omits potentially useful facts but isn't directly misleading. CVE IDs typically aren't assigned in that situation.  (We do realize that the OSS release of Lemur is very new, and that sqlalchemy-utils has much greater usage, e.g., it has a Debian package. We don't have any information about whether Lemur or any other Netflix OSS package is already in widespread use outside of Netflix, e.g., because it is included in a major Linux distribution or for another reason.)  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =IBJp -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
