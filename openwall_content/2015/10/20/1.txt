With this in mind I would like to create one. Openssl command line can easily create them, using either the 2 (default) or 5 generator (explained at )  For example the following code:  #!/bin/bash for i in `seq 1 do     openssl dhparam -text >> $i done  will generate bit primes. If you can ideally simply commit the files to the following github repo:  https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/Diffie-Hellman-Primes/  simply create a directory in the root with your name/whatever you want to call it (nothing rude please) and have a directory for the bit primes and a directory for the bit primes I would appreciate it. If you use a tool other than OpenSSL command line to generate the primes please make a note of it (especially any command line options used) in a .txt file in the root of your data directory. My goal is to collect a few million primes of each size so we have some real data to work with.     -- Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
