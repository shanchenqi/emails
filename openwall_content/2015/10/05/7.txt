Sure!, please find attached the compressed test case as well as a minimal example of a vulnerable program: it is just a call to gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file_at_size. Trying to attach the test case in the last version of Evolution will also produce a crash.  A detailed backtrace of the heap overflow is here:  Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault. in pixops_scale_nearest (dest_has_alpha=<optimized out>, src_has_alpha=<optimized out>, scale_y=1, scale_x=1, src_channels=4,     "", dest_channels=4, dest_rowstride=24, render_y1=<optimized out>,     render_x1=6, render_y0=<optimized out>, render_x0=0, dest_buf=<optimized out>) at        pixops.c: No such file or directory.
