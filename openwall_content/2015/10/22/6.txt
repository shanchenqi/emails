What you need is a good security margin...  No one should be using DH groups anymore and bit groups should have disappeared *before*  http://www.keylength.com/en/3/  If we want PFS to work in practice we need "auditable" deployments... and that won't be possible with custom DH groups (verifying the security/suitability of a group is non-straightforward as the rest of the thread has pointed out).  Really, what are we after here?Â  - Preventing pre-computation? Pick a larger group. - Avoiding "massive" problems in case the standardized groups do turn out to be unsuitable (sub-groups, ...)? - Something else?
