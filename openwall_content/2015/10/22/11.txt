Basically we're in agreement, I think nothing under should even be considered, and we probably need to bump that up in a few years anyways.  I've also been going through source code to see how people use dh params/treat them, and I have some worrying results (basically what I expected though, everything is terrible as usual)  I'm going to be writing this up as an article rather than a long email as I have a few more sticky points to raise (security rabbit holes are so much fun).  -- Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
