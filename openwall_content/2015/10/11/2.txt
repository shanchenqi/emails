The MITRE CVE team doesn't have any straightforward way to satisfy CVE requests about an uncertain set of vulnerabilities (e.g., "least two issues" and "if it is indeed only one").  If the information had been broken down into specific independent vulnerabilities with distinct discoverers, we would typically be able to provide a separate CVE ID per discoverer; however, "I want to thank James Kettle who was the first to report a RCE security issue, Alain Tiemblo, Christophe Coevoet, and Fabien Potencier for finding more possible and dangerous RCEs." doesn't really do that.  It's true that "Prevent importing or calling reserved macro names" seems to correspond to a bug, but the listed references don't have any statements about whether it's independently exploitable.  Similarly, the new code for "Accessing the environment from templates is forbidden to prevent untrusted changes to the environment" in and which weren't mentioned in the CVE request, seems like it is probably for a security-related bug fix; however, again we don't know that it's independently exploitable.  So, what we'll do here is focus only on which is described as "fixed sandbox security issue" and suggests that the problem was that, previously, a critical constraint of "A block must be a method on a Twig_Template instance" wasn't being enforced. Use for this issue.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  X9kopzfIDNWsVlrNsJpx =y/pK -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
