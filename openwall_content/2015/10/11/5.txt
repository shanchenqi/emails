Demonstrating that a crash occurs, or that the flow of execution never halts, after entering command-line arguments is not necessarily sufficient for obtaining a CVE ID.  We found this:    http://info-zip.org/FAQ.html#threads   Can I use the Windows DLLs in a multithreaded application?    The UnZip DLL is believed to be thread-safe.  which suggests that programs exist that are unzipping files for multiple clients within the same run of the program. (Thread safety is not a critical factor; what is important is that an attacker can cause a denial of service to another person who presented their own ZIP archive independently.)  > * A heap overflow triggered by unzipping a file with password (e.g unzip -p > -P x sigsegv.zip)  > AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address at pc bp 0xbfffedb8 sp 0xbfffedac > READ of size 1  Use for this buffer over-read issue.   > * A denegation of service with a file that never finishes unzipping (e.g. > unzip sigxcpu.zip).
