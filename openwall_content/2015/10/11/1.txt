It provides quick messaging across servers, even when deployed on a global scale. One of the recent goals of the project has been to limit memory leaks and test functionality to ensure quality for all users.  While looking for resource leaks and other things to test inside Elemental-IRCd git master, we stumbled on an unfortunate programming error in how the MONITOR command was handled that can lead to a system out-of-memory event if an attacker hammers at the MONITOR command over and over.  ## Affected Daemons  In our testing, the following IRC daemons were affected:  ircd-ratbox SVN trunk and older charybdis 3.5-dev and older ircd-seven and older Elemental-IRCd and older Other derivatives of these daemons will be affected as well unless for some reason they came across and fixed that issue before this release.  ## Vulnerability Information  Public release date: CVE: CVSS v3: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:H/RL:W/RC:C/CR:H/IR:L/AR:H/MAV:N/MAC:L/MPR:N/MUI:N/MC:L/MI:N/MA:H CVSS score: 8.8 / 8.6 / 9.5 Attack complexity: Trivial (less than 30 lines of code)  ## Notes  If applying these patches is somehow impossible, the attack can be completely mitigated by unloading the m_monitor.so module using the following command provided you have permission to load and unload modules:      /MODUNLOAD m_monitor.so  The required privilege to do this is defined as the admin flag inside the flags section of the relevant operator{} block in the configuration (OLD:O:Line).  This patch can be applied at runtime and will automatically garbage-collect any memory that has been leaked in the past.  A full set of technical details will be released as soon as it is confirmed that major IRC networks affected by this have been patched.  ---  Please see the above permanent link for more information, including the links to patches for your preferred daemon.  --               Christine Dodrill <me@...istine.website>        CF54 AAE3 62BF 9C9F B79F  AA18                  https://christine.website     "No matter where you are... everyone is always connected."                         れいん いわくら  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
