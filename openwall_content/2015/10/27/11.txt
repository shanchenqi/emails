In some cases, this address can be a valid userspace address, to which memcpy_toiovec will write the buffers. This can happen when userspace calls write followed by recvmsg.  In that case, memcpy_toiovec will dump the packet contents to the buffer passed to the write call, and can for example overwrite stack contents.  Patch has been submitted:  Versions affected: stable kernels before (3.x.y, x <= 18) that have backported commit ("net: Fix skb csum races when peeking")    Could we get a CVE for this?
