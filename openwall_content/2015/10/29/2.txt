Could you please comment directly about the likelihood of exploitability for code execution? See the post. We currently feel that a CVE assignment for a non-exploitable unzip crash on BusyBox may be unlikely, because BusyBox wouldn't realistically be used for deployment of a program that remains running to offer an unzipping service to multiple clients.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  Hwp1wqHbGbeg1vJhOBFk =VGYW -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
