ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  HYPERCALL_xenoprof_op and HYPERVISOR_xenpmu_op log some errors and attempts at invalid operations.  These log messages are not rate-limited, even though they can be triggered by guests.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest could cause repeated logging to the hypervisor console, leading to a Denial of Service attack.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen versions 3.2.x and later are affected.  (The VPMU part of the vulnerability is applicable only to Xen 4.6 and later.)  ARM systems are not affected.  (The pmu hypercall is x86-specific, and xenoprof is not supported on ARM.)  MITIGATION ==========  The problematic log messages are issued with priority Warning. Therefore they can be rate limited by adding "loglvl=error/warning" to the hypervisor command line or suppressed entirely by adding "loglvl=error".  On systems where the guest kernel is controlled by the host rather than guest administrator, running only kernels which do not call these hypercalls will also prevent untrusted guest users from exploiting this issue. However untrusted guest administrators can still trigger it unless further steps are taken to prevent them from loading code into the kernel (e.g. by disabling loadable modules etc) or from using other mechanisms which allow them to run code at kernel privilege.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.         xen-unstable, Xen 4.6.x             Xen 4.5.x, Xen 4.4.x, Xen 4.3.x  $   $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.   (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
