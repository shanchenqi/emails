WRITE of size report for the exfatfsck-heap-overflow-write-verify_vbr_checksum file. If anyone wants to show that another part of the commit fixed a different vulnerability that wasn't reported in the 25-Heap-overflow-and-endless-loop-in-exfatfsck-exfat-utils.html post, then a second CVE ID may be available.   > Another malformed input can cause an endless loop, leading to a > possible denial of service.  > Especially at risk are systems that are configured to run filesystem > checks automatically on external devices like USB flash drives.  >> Detect infinite loop in rootdir_size(). >>  >> Otherwise malformed FS can cause hang on mount.  We don't feel that this endless-loop issue should necessarily have a CVE ID. There may be some environments in which the attacker can cross a privilege boundary by inserting a flash drive to trigger CPU consumption and/or inability to complete the boot process. Often, shutting off the computer would be an equally effective DoS.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  kbvKUr3QemUYT/s8tYrj =LyLf -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
