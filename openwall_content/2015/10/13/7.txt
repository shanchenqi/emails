An attacker is able to create a private PGP key that will decrypt in OpenPGP.js regardless of the passphrase given.  Also using this flaw it is possible to forge a symmetrically encrypted PGP message (Symmetric-Key Encrypted Session Key Packets (Tag 3)) that will decrypt with any passphrase in OpenPGP.js. This can be an attack vector if successful decryption of such a message is used as an authentication mechanism.  The bug is fixed with a strict check on unknown S2K types.  Info:  Fixed by:  Fixen in: OpenPGP.js  Could a CVE please be assigned to this issue?
