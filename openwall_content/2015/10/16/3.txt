Later use of the SLUB cache causes a kernel panic, and the machine stops responding.  As triggering the bug, causes the machine to stop responding, the issue impacts the availability of the whole machine and its services, that's why I consider requesting a CVE.  -- salva   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
