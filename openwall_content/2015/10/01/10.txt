Use for the Tails vulnerability corresponding to the commit.  If there is any additional Tails vulnerability related to this, another CVE ID may be needed. For example,     says    to be sure, you should add --passive-ftp to your command line.   If you don't do that, your /etc/wgetrc or ~/.wgetrc could include   --no-passive-ftp (or passiveftp = off).  If Tails is supposed to try to ensure that, perhaps there's a requirement to have something like:    alias wget="wget --passive-ftp"  in a system-wide location (possibly /etc/bash.bashrc). The concept of CVE IDs for "failure of a torify step" issues is new, and we aren't sure of the best approach.

The difference here is that sending the client IP address within the TCP application data is inherently a part of the FTP protocol. That's why we've been reluctant to consider this a vulnerability in the upstream wget distribution.  This is also a situation in which the need to torify may be different with IPv6 than with IPv4. IPv4 NAT environments are sometimes set up so that clients cannot successfully use FTP in active mode. Perhaps because of this, it is currently common for FTP clients to use passive mode by default. With IPv6, it is probably more likely that a client can successfully use FTP in active mode. There might be, now or in the near future, FTP clients that try active mode for IPv6 FTP servers. Thus, when Tor is used, there may be information disclosure in EPRT commands even when there hadn't been information disclosure in PORT commands. (Of course, a PORT command may be sent even when active mode is ultimately going to fail. The point is that, for communication between a normal FTP client and a normal IPv4 FTP server, active mode will often never be attempted.)  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  QD/3LlAZGdgiRu5bEuld =9V0C -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
