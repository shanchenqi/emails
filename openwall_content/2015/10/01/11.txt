I suspect using a bash alias in a site-wide config might then qualify for another CVE in the future, along the lines of "programs that spawn wget via system(3), popen(3), or exec family of functions can use unsafe active mode by accident". If Tails is in the business of fixing these things for safety, removing active ftp support from tools seems like better fix.
