To be honest, i don't know. The patched code looks quite complex and i cannot discard any potential arbitrary write there.   > See the > post.

Maybe some of them are using it to unzip files provided from users? In any case, i can update later this thread if i got more precise information about the exploitability of this issue.   > - -- > CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority > M/S > Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA > [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] > -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- > Version: GnuPG v1 > > > > > > > > > > > > > Hwp1wqHbGbeg1vJhOBFk > =VGYW > -----END PGP SIGNATURE----- >   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
