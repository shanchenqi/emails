Also, we think that Zstandard is, for example, not shipped in any well-known Linux distribution. When a piece of code is offered primarily for testing, discoveries of exploitable problems often have low interest among CVE consumers.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =o5EY -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
