There are several distributions including Alpine Linux, widely used in container environments, which by default use busybox to provide the unzip utility. Unzipping of any files downloaded by the user, possibly from untrusted sources, may be affected. I believe CVE is appropriate for user-facing programs commonly used to open untrusted files even without an automated process accepting and processing potentially-malicious files from a client.
