Should there be any middle-ground for how much use a specific value gets? Part of the weakdh gift is the reconition that randomly generated bit primes might be fine for one router or website to use but is terrible when used by millions and might repay the cost to crack it.  Do we allow dhparams when they are randomly generated? Or do we also want to move these to e.g. out of abundance of caution?  (I don't share Kurt's pessimism on generating DH primes, though that does come with the caveat that they should only be generated on systems that have been running long enough to collect enough entropy for random number generation to work well.)
