Assuming people follow and get it correct (and optionally certified) then yes it is "not hard" but one thing that continues to worry me:  We have AFAIK no good test suites to ensure random numbers/primes are cryptographically secure.  If we did we wouldn't have issues like   -- Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
