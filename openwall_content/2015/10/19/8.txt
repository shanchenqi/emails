The relevant parts of the release announcements are here. Can we get CVE's assigned?  * Wikipedia user RobinHood70 reported that the API failed to correctly stop adding new chunks to the upload when the reported size was exceeded, allowing a malicious users to upload add an infinite number of chunks for a single file upload.  * Wikipedia user RobinHood70 also reported that a malicious user could upload chunks of 1 byte for very large files, potentially creating a very large number of files on the server's filesystem.  * Internal review discovered that it is not possible to throttle file uploads.  * Internal review discovered a missing authorization check when removing suppression from a revision. This allowed users with the 'viewsuppressed' user right but not the appropriate 'suppressrevision' user right to unsuppress revisions.  * Richard Stanway from teamliquid.net reported that thumbnails of PNG files generated with ImageMagick contained the local file path in the image metadata.  * Extension:PageTriage - MediaWiki user Grunny discovered a DOM-based XSS in the way the extension handled page titles.  * Extension:Echo - Internal review discovered that Echo could display deleted or suppressed usernames when the username was previously used to Thank users.  * Extension:OAuth - Wikipedia user Sitic discovered that the OAuth extension did not correctly enforce the IP restrictions of a Consumer when using previously negotiated credentials.  * Extension:OAuth - Wikipedia user Sitic discovered that OAuth would accept a valid signature from any Consumer when checking the authorization signature. This allowed a registered Consumer who gained access to another Consumer's users' access tokens and secrets to use those credentials.
