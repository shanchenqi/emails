I think this may be a bit of a slippery slope here.  How many machines would have to be vulnerable for a given group to be considered big enough to be “weak” and therefore worth of having a CVE issued?  Would that number be 1%?  5%?  10%?  At what point is it more dangerous to generate your own DH groups on systems that do not have sufficient uptime, versus re-using an existing DH group that might be considered “weak”?   There was a time when DH groups were considered sufficiently safe, and was overkill.  At what point does become “weak” in the same way that is today?  How many years in advance are we going to build into the system, so that we can have people “safely” transitioned off DH groups and onto whatever the next new thing is?  I mean, NIST is having a hard enough time getting people to stop using MD-5, much less SHA-1.  And if SHA-1 falls this year, how long before SHA-2 falls?  -- Brad Knowles <brad@...b-internet.org> LinkedIn Profile: <http://tinyurl.com/y8kpxu>   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
