If the unpacking user *does* have write access to the symlink target directory, but the file already exists in that directory, however the user does not have write-access to that file, won't the write fail then as well?  A common use-case for tar is writing to a single directory and below as you say. But it is by no means the only capability.  Remember that tar was created primarily for software distribution and compressed tar files are most often used to this day for that purpose. Software distribution almost always involves writing files to many different directories at all levels of the filesystem. Symlinks between them are quite common as well.  What am I misunderstanding?     *Trust in truth keeps hope aliverobertcwatson1@...il.com <robertcwatson1@...il.com>www.docsalvage.info <http://www.docsalvage.info>www.CivicChorale.org <http://www.CivicChorale.org>* <http://www.wunderground.com/cgi-bin/findweather/getForecast?query=Tallahassee,%20FL> <https://www.healthcare.gov/>  On Fri, Oct 23, at AM, Tim Brown <tmb@...35.com> wrote:  > On Thursday 22 October Robert Watson wrote: > > Apologies if I'm naive but... since /tmp is world writable, how is this a > > vulnerability? > > The permissions on /tmp having nothing at all to do with this, not sure why > you brought that up.
