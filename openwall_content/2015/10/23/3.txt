The permissions on /tmp having nothing at all to do with this, not sure why  you brought that up. With most archiving tools, there is an expectation that  unpacking will involve writing only to the current directory and below and/or  a user specified directory and below. This breaks that assumption because the  unpacker may create a symlink to a location outside of the directory which  later may then be followed when further files are unpacked. Depending on the  user permissions, this could lead to sensitive files being overwritten. Even if  the unpacker validates the path it is writing to is as described, the  validation fails to account for the potential presence of symbolic link files  that point elsewhere.
