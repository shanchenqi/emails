(i figure bytes per prime, a well-known, shared generator)  Larger groups (or more groups) inflate the size even further.  I know RAM is cheap these days but for embedded devices a quarter meg or more of RAM is still not insignificant.  > Basically we're in agreement, I think nothing under should even be > considered, and we probably need to bump that up in a few years anyways.  yep, agreed.  > I've also been going through source code to see how people use dh > params/treat them, and I have some worrying results (basically what I > expected though, everything is terrible as usual)  :/  > I'm going to be writing this up as an article rather than a long email as I > have a few more sticky points to raise (security rabbit holes are so much > fun).
