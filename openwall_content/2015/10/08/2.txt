I (re)discovered a flaw that allows arbitrary command execution when the library is given untrusted strings to show in a menu prompt.  The flaw was initially reported in at but it seems this never reached upstream. I recently reported the bug upstream see that report for some additional details.  Upstream has indicated to be working on a fix (see upstream bug), but no patches are available yet.  Impact seems limited, I'm not aware of any well-known programs that use this library and are vulnerable (only two Debian packages depend on it, both use a UI::Dialog backend that is unaffected).
