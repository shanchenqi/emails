We do have an issue management process defined on our side, which includes requesting CVEs and disclosing the issues in our release notes (once we make a release) and issue tracker.  As others have mentioned, we’re not treating it as a CVE issue because client mode is disabled and not supported, and that’s something we highlight in our docs (https://github.com/awslabs/s2n/blob/master/docs/USAGE-GUIDE.md#client-mode); that the support is there only for testing and development work. Client mode support is also our number one feature request from early developers, so I think it's clear to any adopters that it isn’t supported. Even the s2nc CLI requires you to manually set the environment variable, which you have to find for yourself in the docs. By default it simply tells you that client mode is disabled.  Notably, s2n does not yet include any or certificate validation, and we haven’t focused our testing on how it behaves as a client. Essentially the mode is there so that we can two-way end-to-end tests and those tests have to awkwardly set an environment variable. Our focus is definitely on the server side.   Right now s2n is also in a pre-release mode; we’re not providing API or ABI stability guarantees (https://github.com/awslabs/s2n/blob/master/docs/USAGE-GUIDE.md#s2n-api) just yet - so that we can be responsive to adopter’s suggestions if they don’t like our first cut. That restriction also means that we’re not seeing any production usage from downstream adopters, or downstream packaging. I’m not aware of anyone using s2n as a client.
