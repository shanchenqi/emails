DMARC isn't some rogue thing that just a few people are doing. It's all been codified as RFC and lots of mail providers have implemented it. There are definitely some things that can be improved about it (the DMARC WG in the IETF is very busy -- https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dmarc-interoperability-04 for their latest work on this), but ignoring DMARC is just putting your head in the sand. Best to deal with the annoying workarounds for now until the next evolution can be spec'd out and implemented. Otherwise, you risk losing important e-mail (like joyful oss-security@ mails ;-]).  DMARC is just one aspect of that.
