Admittedly, a user might have already -- for an unrelated reason -- configured OpenSSL to disable client-initiated renegotiation, and might have an expectation that there would be (in effect) propagation of this choice into a Squid build. We feel that this isn't an obvious expectation, especially because that type of propagation isn't automatic: it requires that an OpenSSL-based product have application-specific code to support the propagation.  There's no CVE ID for now. If there's a future case where either the official Squid distribution, or a repackager, decides to unconditionally force "defined(SSL3_FLAGS_NO_RENEGOTIATE_CIPHERS)" to be true as a vulnerability fix for an OpenSSL environment, then a CVE ID should then be available.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =L1eB -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
