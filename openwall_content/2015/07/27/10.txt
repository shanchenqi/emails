'\n' injection in /etc/passwd, really? Something's not quite right here. Modern multi-user operating systems should be secure by default, like Owl and OpenBSD.

If you're the administrator of important systems like these, and you're worried about getting rooted by some userland exploit like this, sorry but you're doing it wrong. Either you secure the default install of your operating system (and remove the suid bits from binaries like userhelper), or you install an operating system that's secure by default (like Owl and its tcb). But it's not anymore.  --    Jeff Collins   jeffcollins@...lforce.net  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
