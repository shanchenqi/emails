This flaw exists because the appointment registration functionality does not validate input to the 'first-name', 'last-name' or 'phone-number' parameters before returning it to authenticated users. This allows a context-dependent attacker to create a specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser session within the trust relationship between their browser and the server.  Root cause:  The software does not neutralize user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to authenticated users.  Proof-of-concept:  1. Select service and a provider 2. Select date and time 3. Fill in your information using payload as First name:     Henri"><img src='#' onerror=alert(document.cookie) /> 4. Log-in as administrator or as provider/secretary 5. Go to "Calendar" 6. Open up the appointment 7. Malicious code is executed  Fixed in following commit:      References:     http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting     https://scapsync.com/cwe/CWE-79          - --  Henri Salo -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  wGK5beno2YAwGfu/INkQ =+FHU -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
