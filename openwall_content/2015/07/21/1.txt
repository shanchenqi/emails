Our interpretation is that there is only one security problem. The download.php script should only be operating on ZIP files created by the image-export.php script (see the http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/image-export/trunk/ directory), but does not enforce that in any way. The latter script has "define( 'DOWNLOAD_PATH', dirname( __FILE__ ) );" near the top. There doesn't seem to be any evidence that either reading other files in the DOWNLOAD_PATH directory, or deleting other files in the DOWNLOAD_PATH directory, is supported behavior. This is not necessarily about directory traversal. The only file that should be either read or deleted is an images*.zip file. Deleting this file is apparently intentional because there's no need to continue storing both the individual files and the ZIP archive.  We don't think there should be two CVE IDs based on an argument such as "reading files is probably important only with directory traversal, but deleting files is probably important even without directory traversal."  Use for the vulnerability in which download.php proceeds with readfile and unlink without verifying that the pathname is image-export's own pathname for its own ZIP file.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =A5bx -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
