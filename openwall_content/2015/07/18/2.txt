Presumably, that affects email clients as well.  We have tracked this down to the /etc/mailcap entry generated from the openjdk-7 .desktop file, after this change in mime-support (which is specific to Debian and its downstreams):  mime-support unstable; urgency=low    Parse Desktop entries to generate mailcap entries.           Patch from Brian M. Carlson. (Closes:   -- Charles Plessy <plessy@...ian.org>  Sun, 05 May  This change is part of Debian jessie, previous releases are not affected.  After consultation with the mime-support maintainers, the resolution in removes the MIME type registration from the openjdk-7 package.  Auto-generation of /etc/mailcap from .desktop files remains the intended behavior of the mime-support package.  The unintended code execution was reported initially to MITRE by Alexander Neumann, and MITRE assigned to this issue, without a full root cause analysis, incorrectly assuming it was a w3m (and not Debian) vulnerability.  For other packages with .desktop files affected in the same way, we will assign separate CVE IDs from Debian's pool.  We do not believe any of the affected packages are in the supported package set of any Debian downstream.
