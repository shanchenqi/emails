(asking because PoC did not work on my Chrome (64-bit) on OSX). If it is non responsive then the impact is very limited. Worst thing I can think of is showing "your account is suspended, please contact technical support on and then using the trust user puts in the URL for phone phishing. If it is responsive, then it's indeed pretty bad.  Cheers! V.
