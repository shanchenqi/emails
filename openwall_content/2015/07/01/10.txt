(There's extra code to make the x11_refuse_time value usable within two source-code files, but adding that code doesn't seem to be related to any independent problem.)   We didn't completely understand the rationale for moving "system(cmd)" after the x11_refuse_time assignment, or whether this is addressing an independent problem. It seems conceivable that there's a very slow network connection to the X server, and an "xauth generate" may therefore take a very long time. So, we think this might add a risk that, by the time system(cmd) finishes, the refusal deadline has already passed. If we're misunderstanding this or there's a vulnerability fixed by moving the system(cmd) call, please let us know.  > - if (x11_refuse_time != 0 && monotime() >= x11_refuse_time) { > + if (x11_refuse_time != 0 && (u_int)monotime() >= x11_refuse_time) {  We're guessing that this isn't a vulnerability fix, and that the author just somehow doesn't want x11_refuse_time to be a time_t.  > "fail open" > behaviour in the X11 server when clients attempted connections with > expired credentials.  The scope of does not include any fail-open characteristics of an X server. There could possibly be a separate CVE ID if there is an error that needs to be fixed in the X codebase.   >  * ssh-agent(1): fix weakness of agent locking (ssh-add -x) to >    password guessing by implementing an increasing failure delay, >    storing a salted hash of the password rather than the password >    itself and using a timing-safe comparison function for verifying >    unlock attempts.  Our current thought is that a CVE ID may not be needed because attacks against ssh-agent locking don't cross a privilege boundary. In other words, the changelog entry could be interpreted to mean addition of a new security feature related to a threat model that wasn't in the previous design goals (e.g., password guessing by malware running under the same account).  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =kcq2 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
