Daniel Micay said: "It does display a window with the oracle.com address" "why you've got an ever increasing number of setTimeout events" Alexander E. Patrakov said: "Looks like a fork bomb" Thanks for testing! The number of "setTimeout" does NOT need to be increasing forever. OK, I admit - we are lazy(it works and we don't touch it anymore) :-)  Roney Gomes said: "it worked on the desktop version of Opera" Wow! Thanks for letting us know. Here is the screenshot of Opera And Chrome (A number is displayed in Chrome's address bar, not the same as Opera)  Daniel Micay said: "it can't always be replicated" "I've tried it a few times and" "it fails about as often as it works" Valentinas Bakaitis said: "PoC did not work" Hey! The trick here is timing: Please modify those numbers in code - make them smaller.  Zak Siddiqui said: "Is it reproducible with HTTPS?" Yes, we just tried this URL https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page It works. In fact, it works BETTER against HTTPS, because HTTPS is slower, so timing is easier.  Florian Weimer said: "they show the new URL while still displaying old content" Exactly, that's the cause of this bug.  In the end, allow me to repeat: No user interaction on the fake page. But, anyone can do "BBB Accredited Business" "PayPal Partner" etc.  Kind Regards,  PS We love clever tricks.
