Finding information about vulnerabilities with different dates does not always mean that separate CVE IDs are used. For example, if a patch was ineffective in the sense that it did not actually fix any aspect of a vulnerability, and then an effective patch and a new advisory were produced in the previously assigned ID would continue to be used - there would not be a new ID.  The available information about includes the "Lack of taintness check in dl" section of with "dl doesn't check taintness ... This vulnerability was reported by sheepman" and "Please upgrade to ... See the ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.8/ archives.  Comparing ext/dl/sym.c between p71 and p72 shows a new rb_check_safe_obj(pval) line in rb_dlsym_call.  Comparing ext/dl/dl.c between p71 and p72 shows new instances of OBJ_INFECT, among other changes.  The commit mentions "Patch by sheepman" and a change to a .rb file (no changes to any .c file).  Is the issue a new issue because it is specific to a "tainted arguments to a C function" attack, and the patch correctly resolved the test case involving uname?  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =uFUY -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
