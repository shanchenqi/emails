Our current feeling is that it is best to have two CVE IDs: one for the original "does not enforce the DNS protocol limit concerning record set sizes" issue and one for the "Quotas were being bypassed" issue. Is that OK?  The basic rationale is that the issues can be independently fixed, i.e., regardless of how large a quota exists or whether that quota is sensible, the "rendering loop in desginate-mdns can does not make progress" behavior is still a relevant vulnerability. Also, even after the loop is fixed, an installation may have its own reason for a small quota, and thus any quota bypass is a vulnerability.  We feel that item 3, adding a timeout, can be considered a security enhancement opportunity that should not have its own CVE ID, i.e., there is no report of a vulnerability that can be fixed only with a timeout. Finally, our understanding is that multiple names are being used to refer to the general https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Designate/Blueprints/MiniDNS concept, i.e., we think "MiniDNS does not have a timeout" is an observation about the Designate codebase, not a third-party DNS server such as from the https://code.google.com/p/minidns/ site. Also, we think this part of the Designate codebase is also called designate-mdns (misspelled as desginate-mdns) and mDNS -- these are essentially alternative names for Designate MiniDNS.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =a10I -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
