(umask        if echo "$1" >>"$treefile"; then :; else          echo "$progname: $treefile: could not append to arg file, goodbye." >&2          exit 1        fi        # ...     done  This is insecure because the filename is predictable and, more  importantly, the program doesn't fail atomically if the file already  exists.
