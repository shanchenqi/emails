Oh, hi there.  My views are not very arbitrary; rather they are based on years of trying to defend big infrastructures.  As I see it, there are two reasons for releasing working exploits without warning;  1) Forcing the hand of a non-responsive vendor,  2) Stroking a weak ego by showing off. (Or for marketing, but that comes    to the same thing.)  Except for case 1, releasing a working exploit *does not help anybody* except the kiddies. If there are other reasons, I'd like to be told about them.  If Qualys had released a slightly less detailed advisory, or even just left off the actual exploit, and given users a day or two to patch their systems before going full disclosure, the risk to innocent bystanders would have been much reduced.  --  Leif Nixon ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ "supercomputer specialists are charming, polite [and] witty" -- Wired Magazine ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
