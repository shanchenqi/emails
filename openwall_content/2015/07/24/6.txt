I concur. The releasing of PoC's are very important, for many reasons. It allows, as stated, the ability to pentest a system efficiently.  I think in this case, it is inappropriate for a PoC to be released on the same day as the updates being pushed. As everybody knows, there are a lot of hacked boxes on the internet. Now someguy that has a botnet of local-users will be able to mass root all the boxes while the owners sleep, because they have been given no warning at all about this.. Even if 48 hours was waited before the PoC was released, it would be much better.  That's just my 2cents anyways.
