In professional pentesting, proof of exploitation is essential. Most often than not, a real attacker will invest time and resources into a working exploit, the customer will not feel the need to invest into it just for simulation.  Moreover, as soon as systems can be patched, they should be. Of course a few hours delay is not realistic, but I want to be sure that everyone understands how much "releasing a working exploit *does not help anybody*" is false.  I urge researchers to continue to release their exploits into the public domain. Do it "responsibly", maybe get help in order to do it correctly, but do it, because it's beneficial more than harmful to any potential target.  --  Martino Dell'Ambrogio Security Auditor Web: http://www.tillo.ch/ Email: tillo@...lo.ch    Download attachment "smime.p7s" of type "application/pkcs7-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
