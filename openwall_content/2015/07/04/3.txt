The scope of CVE isn't strictly limited to released upstream versions. As mentioned at the bottom of the post, some products sometimes have CVEs for this type of unreleased software, whereas others do not. We feel that Foreman is probably in the latter category.  http://theforeman.org/contribute.html and suggest that the incorrect code was found only on the develop branch:        - Master - latest stable release code     - Develop - new features and bug fixes      Master is frozen between major releases.  http://theforeman.org/introduction.html doesn't suggest that anyone ships a product using code from the Foreman develop branch, but we don't want to immediately rule out that possibility. This seems to be a good choice for moving to the REJECT state, and we will most likely do that next week unless there's an important reason to keep  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =jqn1 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
