A local attacker must set up   a symlink at /run/lock/lxc/var/lib/lxc/<CONTAINER>, prior to an admin   ever creating an LXC container on the system. If an admin then creates   a container with a name matching <CONTAINER>, the symlink will be   followed and LXC will create an empty file at the symlink's target as   the root user.    -   - Affects LXC and higher   -   - (master)   - (stable-1.1)   - (stable-1.0)  * Roman Fiedler discovered a flaw that allows processes intended to be   run inside of confined LXC containers to escape their AppArmor or   SELinux confinement. A malicious container can create a fake proc   filesystem, possibly by mounting tmpfs on top of the container's   /proc, and wait for a lxc-attach to be ran from the host environment.   lxc-attach incorrectly trusts the container's   /proc/PID/attr/{current,exec} files to set up the AppArmor profile and   SELinux domain transitions which may result in no confinement being   used.   -   - Affects LXC and higher   -   - (master)   - (stable-1.1)   - (stable-1.0)  Tyler  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
