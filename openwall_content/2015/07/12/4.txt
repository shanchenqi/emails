Web pages on different domains can make non-AJAX POST requests to known IPython URLs, and IPython will honor them. The user's browser will automatically send IPython cookies along with the requests. The response is blocked by the Same-Origin Policy, but the request isn't.  API paths with issues:  * POST /api/contents/<path>/<file> * POST /api/contents/<path>/<file>/checkpoints * POST /api/contents/<path>/<file>/checkpoints/<checkpoint_id> * POST /api/kernels * POST /api/kernels/<kernel_id>/<action> * POST /api/sessions * POST /api/clusters/<cluster_id>/<action>  Mitigations:  Upgrade to IPython If using pip,    pip install --upgrade ipython[notebook]  For conda:    conda update conda   conda update ipython ipython-notebook  Vulnerability was found by Ahmad Khan, Security Engineer at IBM.  --  Kyle Kelley (@rgbkrk <https://twitter.com/rgbkrk>; lambdaops.com, developer.rackspace.com)   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
