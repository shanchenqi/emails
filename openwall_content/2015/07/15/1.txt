Yet with default settings a binary is compiled (bin/s2nc) which will work in client mode when environment variable S2N_ENABLE_CLIENT_MODE=1 is set (as documented). So it is possible several people were tempted to use s2n in client mode already as the client mode code is actually compiled into the lib and useable by default. I guess it depends on your definition of "enabled".
