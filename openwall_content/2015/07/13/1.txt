(Cerberus survey): Analysis of Responses"  A productive direction may be for the free software community (or an even wider community, if possible) to agree on de facto mainstream C standard, where certain kinds of UB and such would in fact be defined in specific ways.  There would still remain many kinds of UB and such, but fewer of them and the easier avoidable ones.  As things currently are, non-trivial programs sort of have to make certain assumptions beyond what's guaranteed by C standards anyway.
