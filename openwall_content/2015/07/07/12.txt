In some cases, a client might be able to cause a buffer alignment issue and retrieve uninitialized memory contents that exhibit data from a past request or session.  I want to address sincere congratulations to Charlie Smurthwaite of aTech Media for the really detailed traces he provided which made it possible to find the cause of this bug.  Every user of 1.5-dev, 1.5.x or 1.6-dev must upgrade to or latest 1.6-dev snapshot to fix this issue, or use the backport of the fix provided by their operating system vendors.  was assigned to this bug."  Fix:   CVE:   "The buffer_slow_realign function in HAProxy 1.5.x before and 1.6-dev does not properly realign a buffer that is used for pending outgoing data, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information (uninitialized memory contents of previous requests) via a crafted request."  Debian and Ubuntu have already sent out advisories.
