While it does not crash the system, it does make it very easy to conduct a DoS against the application.   Software: sogo Vendor: Inverse Site: www.sogo.nu Previously requested: No Type: DoS Description: Due to incorrect handling of certain PROPFIND requests, the site is vulnerable to a DoS.  ----------------------------------- PROPFIND /SOGo/dav/ HTTP/1.1 Host: <hostname> Connection: keep-alive Content-Length: 0   ------------------------------------  will return almost immediately  ----------------------------------- PROPFIND /SOGo/dav/ HTTP/1.1 Host: myhost Connection: keep-alive   ----------------------------------- without the Content-Length will keep the child process occupied until it times out. Default value one minute. With only <#processes> requests per <timeout> the application can be rendered inaccessible.  No authentication/valid account is required. The bug has been reported at www.sogo.nu/bugs as a private bugreport, but labelled won't fix as it is 'how servers work' and that tuning the timeout will help. I disagree and would like to get a CVE for it.   with kind regards, Stefan  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
