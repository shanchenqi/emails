The Apache Directory LDAP client API is an ongoing effort to provide an enhanced LDAP API, as a replacement for JNDI and the existing LDAPAPI (jLdap and Mozilla LDAP API).  This is a schema aware API, with some convenient ways to access a LDAP server. This API is not only targeting the Apache Directory Server, but should work pristine with any LDAP server.  It's also an extensible API : new Controls, schema elements and network layer could be added or used in the near future. It's also OSGi capable.   This release is fixing a security vulnerability : a Timing Attack vulnerability.   Here is the list of the other fixed issues :   *Bugs :*     - - DSML prettyprint does not work, prints error    - -    OpenLDAP SchemaObjectRenderer produces schema with syntax error  *Improvements :*     - - OSGi:    Import package range for slf4j  Feel free to experiment, we highly appreciate your feedback !
