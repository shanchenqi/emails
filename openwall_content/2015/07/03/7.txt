Recently I found that Getsimple CMS is vulnerable to Stored Cross site scripting attack.  *POC:*  While creating a new page, give the page title as *new"onmouseover="alert(1)";* and in the content, give *<svg onload="alert(10)">*. Now save it and then go to *pages.php* and then hover the mouse over the cross mark (which is used to delete the post). You can see that XSS is triggered.  Now, go to *backups.php* and hover the mouse over it and again you can see the XSS triggered. Now open the backup and you can see that *<svg>* is triggered there. But since there is regex checking in the main pages, the *<svg>* won't get triggered in the main page.  Any normal user has the ability to add new pages and each time when a post is saved, it gets automatically saved into *backups.php*  *Date of reporting:* 3rd July,  *Exploit Author:* Anirudh Anand  *Vendor Homepage*: http://get-simple.info/  *Software Link:* http://get-simple.info/download/  *Version affected: *Possibly all version <=  *Tested on:* Linux:- Ubuntu, Debian, PHP - 5.5   The issue has been reported to the vendor:  Is it possible to assign CVE identifier for the same ?
