All applications which rely on serialization and do not isolate the code which deserializes objects are subject to this vulnerability.  *Mitigation*  Apache Groovy is the first and only supported release under the Apache Software Foundation. It is strongly recommanded that all users upgrade to this version. If you cannot upgrade or rely on an older, unsupported version of Groovy, you can apply the following patch on the MethodClosure class (src/main/org/codehaus/groovy/runtime/MethodClosure.java):   public class MethodClosure extends Closure { +    private Object readResolve() { +        throw new UnsupportedOperationException(); +    }  *Credit*  This vulnerability was discovered by:     cpnrodzc7 working with HP's Zero Day Initiative  *References*  http://groovy-lang.org/security.html   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
