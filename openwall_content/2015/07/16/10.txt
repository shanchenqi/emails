Encrypting attachments to arbitrary recipients, simply because a PGP key is known, has a usability problem. Some mail systems automatically and silently remove attachments that can't be scanned for malware (e.g., when the pre-encryption content type of the attachment is one that can have malware). This has, in some sense, a risk of "data corruption" because the meaning of a message can be vastly different if the attachment doesn't arrive. If the sender explicitly selects the "encrypt message" option, then that's a very strong signal that encryption is required, and kmail did encrypt attachments in that case. The "automatic encryption" implementation might have made a different tradeoff between security and usability. But, probably not. We decided to assign a CVE ID anyway because the commit refers to the change as a bug fix, because there was apparently no documentation of an intentional tradeoff, and because we're unaware of any widespread acceptance of a need to avoid encrypted attachments in some cases.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJVqDDjAAoJEKllVAevmvmsgzsH/iMc5jgnkEvcCUgwObvTm7eP =/PrR -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
