After talking with Luca Barbato which is both a Gentoo and Libav  developer, I spent a bit of my time fuzzing libav and in particular I  fuzzed libavcodec though avplay.                                                                                                         I hit a crash and after I reported it to upstream, they confirmed the  issue as a divide-by-zero.
