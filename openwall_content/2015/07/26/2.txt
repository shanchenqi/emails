Here comes the requirement #2: adding the line to /etc/passwd must be sufficient for the user to log in.   > Our ultimate goal is to inject an arbitrary line into /etc/passwd  > (for example, the a-line "\na::0:0::/:\n")  In my tests, I used "a::0:0::/:/bin/sh"  Obviously enough, these tests have failed with the "Authentication service cannot retrieve authentication info" error as the requirement #2 was not satisfied - all my hosts use TCB password shadowing.  Anyway, thank you for a nice catch :-)   --  Alexey V.
