This allows for man-in-the-middle attacks on those connections.  The fix for this problem has been released as part of Ansible  The Ansible playbook below is a proof-of-concept that can be used to safely validate the incorrect behaviour:    - name: a playbook demonstrating MITM in ansible     hosts:     connection: local     tasks:     - name: this should fail       get_url: url=https://kennethreitz.org/ dest="/tmp/shouldnotexist.htmlâ  This playbook attempts to download a HTML file from a site presenting a certificate that is valid, but not for the site in question. Versions of Ansible from onward correctly fail to validate the certificate, but earlier versions will download the file regardless and the playbook will successfully exit.
