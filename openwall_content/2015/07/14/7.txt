Note: not that the the BIGNUM is NULL, but that the value of the number is a literal zero.  [snip]  Reminder: Client mode is disabled and won't be enabled until validation is ready. But we can still make improvements and fixes in the meantime.  so I'm not sure this needs a CVE as the code is not yet enabled.  --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
