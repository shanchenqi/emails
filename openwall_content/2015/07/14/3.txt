This was fixed in ansible (commit list below, see https://github.com/ansible/ansible).  I am not an ansible committer but Toshio requested I follow up. I understand that a request was made by Toshio to CVE-assign on 1st July but no response was received. The commits are already public and it has been announced on ansible's security page: http://www.ansible.com/security.  Could a CVE please be assigned to this issue?   Thanks,  Martin.   commit Author: Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@...oraproject.org> Date:   Wed Jun 24      Use BUFSIZE when putting file as well as fetching file.  commit Author: Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@...oraproject.org> Date:   Tue Jun 23      Fix exec_command to not use a shell  commit Author: Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@...oraproject.org> Date:   Mon Jun 22      Fix problem with chroot connection plugins and symlinks from within the chroot.  commit Author: Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@...oraproject.org> Date:   Fri Jun 19      Fix problem with jail and zone connection plugins and symlinks from within the jail/zone.  commit Author: Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@...oraproject.org> Date:   Fri Jun 19      Fix problem with jail and zone connection plugins and symlinks from within the jail/zone.
