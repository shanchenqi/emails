The following example will pop an alert box:  ​  Attackers could use this vulnerability to steal cookies or extract email-content.  Commit: 1.1: Not claimed to affect 1.0.  > * security improvement in contact photo handling  Fix security issue in contact photo handling  There is a potential for an arbitrary read from an authenticated user who uploads a contact (vCard) with a specially crafted POST. [...] by supplying the "_alt" param in the POST. User must be authenticated. [...] I was able to read any file on disk (the apache has access to, e.g. config/config.inc.php) using GET request  Commits: 1.1: 1.0:  > * potential info disclosure from temp directory  Fix potential info disclosure issue by protecting directory access  The logs directory is not protected from browsing. Most log entries are not bad, but one became evident on my host that was pretty nasty.  It looked like the following:  <ijpv9kqo> DB Error: Duplicate entry 'ijpv9kqofvpksxxxxxxxxxxxx' for key 'PRIMARY' (SQL Query: INSERT INTO `session` (`sess_id`, `vars`, `ip`, `created`, `changed`) VALUES ('ijpv9kqofvpksxxxxxxxx', 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx=', now(), now())) in on line (POST  I obfuscated the sensitive fields, but this would be enough for a non-credential user to view the file (via the webroot/logs/errors file), and then replace their own cookies with the entry from above to log in as a user that was listed there.  This seems to be a very rare occurrence, but considering that other SQL/other actions might report other sensitive data into this file, it might be worth automatically protecting this directory with an .htaccess file, or prepending a php tag to avoid overt reading by any unauthenticated user.  Commits: 1.1: Not claimed to affect 1.0.
