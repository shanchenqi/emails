I had a local crash !  You told dash to interpret a command 2 gigabytes long, and it failed to do so; additionally, the failure was a crash, not a deterministic semi-graceful exit. That sounds like a bug.  However, to be a security vulnerability rather than "just a bug", a buffer overflow is not enough; to be a security vulnerability, it would have to be an *attacker-triggerable* buffer overflow.  Is there any circumstance under which an attacker - not you - can cause this to happen, other than via an arbitrary-code-execution vulnerability in some other component?  (If you are already vulnerable to attacker-controlled arbitrary code execution, then dash crashing is the least of your worries.)
