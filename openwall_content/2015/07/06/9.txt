Yes, that's correct, the analysis of the first part of my last email is based on That was intentional, as I've tried to provide additional information to this old vulnerability so that a CVE may be assigned.   > it could be surely usefull to learn if after switching to the more > recent version you still continue to confirm your issues. > and if the answer is eventually yes, sensing a copy of the input > files causing malfunctions will surely help to debug the code.  The integer overflow, a new vulnerability described in the second part of my last email, still affects the latest version. I'll provide you with a reproducer in a private email within the next couple of minutes.
