In this case, the report says "non-printable characters aren't check in every case of user data" and "need more string checks for non-printable characters." That might mean that character-set restrictions were an intentional protection mechanism, implemented correctly elsewhere in the product, and the author can definitely have a viewpoint that the incomplete protection mechanism requires a CVE ID. If there previously were no character-set restrictions at all, but the author believes that the original design goal was to have the user-entered name directly visible to the admin, then again the author can state that a CVE ID is required, We, of course, discourage anyone from asserting an original design goal when what they are really doing is adding an entirely new security feature.  If this type of claim of a vulnerability finding is not originated or confirmed by the author, it becomes difficult to argue that a CVE ID is required. Maybe the product was actually intended to store non-alphabetic names (including the types of names in in order to support a wide range of personal-identity choices, perhaps even the symbol of The Artist Formerly Known As Prince.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  iQEcBAEBCAAGBQJVulEMAAoJEKllVAevmvmsSyUH/AkZFfJA+27LdMYdZmtFrPfA =ezM2 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
