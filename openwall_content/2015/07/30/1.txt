Since this output is displayed by default on the front page of the Wordpress admin panel, the XSS here leads to very easy administrator account compromise.  Reported privately via vendor and fixed in current release.  == Vendor: http://www.wp-slimstat.com Reported: Patched:  as per ==  Regards, Sam Pizzey  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
