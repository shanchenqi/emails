The main concern is that all of the PHP 7.0 announcements have specifically mentioned "THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT PREVIEW - DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION!" This is similar, but not identical, to the 'not directly correspond to a "product"' factor mentioned at the end of the post.  One counterargument is that PHP 7.0, as far as we know, actually is used in production at a very significant scale. We don't think that oss-security would be an appropriate place for anyone to announce that a major closed-source service is based on PHP 7.0. Maybe it's sufficient to note that some web-hosting providers are advertising PHP 7.0 for general customer use (e.g., the https://www.a2hosting.com/php-7-hosting page) or that there are non-beta versions of open-source applications that only work with PHP 7.0 (we found but it is not a real example).  Unless there is other information, we feel that CVE can include the issue, but that this doesn't mean that CVE should include every bug fixed during 7.0 development, even if a security impact is conceivable.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  ubAzQ6NndSBlkFpL/EySgoTwXSyGFaZwcwNhx1h/uFtzHWrjWDFYebPMQ//IYIDv =1jH2 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
