This may, for example, help with a future situation where someone decides to ship an updated texlive package based on the latest code.  Use for the vulnerability originally introduced in Revision  Use for the vulnerability later introduced in Revision  Also, exploitation might be relatively easy because the comment at the beginning of the script suggests running it as root from cron at zero minutes past each hour.  Finally, it's somewhat likely that there was a third issue:          mktexlsr: Fix possible symlink exploit.  Unless someone wants to find a diff from and show that that "possible" symlink exploit was a "real" symlink exploit, we are not assigning a ID.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =8UNr -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
