So in past we have had vulns around injection of terminal control characters into log files:  http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=terminal+escape  However now I'm seeing flaws around printing/display of user data, e.g. systems where a user can set their own name, but fills it with backspace characters, so when an admin looks at the text record it is mangled/shows something the attacker wants them to see and not the "True" data.  An example of this is:   assuming there are no actual terminal escape sequences allowed, but just backspace characters/etc, is this worthy of a CVE? Right now it definitely allows manipulation of displayed data, and if an admin cuts and pastes it would potentially be just the modified data, so I'm thinking there is an integrity impact (not a very big one mind you), but it's quite limited (at least as I understand the issue right now).  --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
