I feel so cheated!".  AFAICT, virtually all the open-source and closed-source security testing tools are dependent on the availability of this information; this certainly includes Nessus, most web security scanners, most AV software, etc.  > In these situations, where an exploit for a new local root vulnerability > turned up without prior warning, we typically started seeing root-level > incidents within 24 hours.

Would you choose not to do this in situations where no public exploit is available, and therefore you would be unlikely to see the immediately evident nuisance attacks described in your message?  Starting with the premise that the disclosure of security bugs makes computer systems more vulnerable to attacks, would it be preferable to completely discourage sharing vulnerability information with the general public? If not, why?  /mz  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
