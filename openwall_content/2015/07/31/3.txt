First, this was just another local userland exploit, and local userland exploits are usually published at the same time as their corresponding patches and advisories:   Second, the libuser bugs are no complicated memory-corruption bugs (no ROP-chain or ASLR-bypass is needed): an exploit for the common case can be written in well under an hour (roothelper.c is complicated only because it handles all corner cases).  Third, the userhelper binary is NOT default on all Red-Hat-based distros, but the chfn binary IS, which is why we purposely chose to release our userhelper exploit, but NOT our chfn exploit.

Looks like "just business...".  We are not into that kind of business: the reason we internally audit open-source code at Qualys is that it allows us to make our products and infrastructure more secure, and it is a great way to contribute to the open-source community.  When we contacted Red Hat about the libuser vulnerabilities, we sent them both our advisory and our exploit, and they promptly replied with two CVEs and patches for us to review.  We would like to thank Red Hat's Security Response Team and developers for giving us the opportunity to review the patches while they were being written, because the end-result greatly benefited from this cooperation.  As for why Red Hat published their updates and patches one hour after the Coordinated Release Date (and we published our advisory even later than that), Kurt Seifried already answered this here:   With best regards,  --  the Qualys Security Advisory team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
