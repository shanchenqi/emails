Could it be classified as Use of Insufficiently  Random Values?  According to the SRTP documentation   it provides 80 bits of random data, which is quite a borderline.  Thanks.  --  Adam Maris / Red Hat Product Security   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
