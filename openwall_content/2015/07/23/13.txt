The patch is relatively un-intrusive in terms of LoC but understanding its impact requires knowledge of how OpenSSH implements keyboard-interactive authentication.

You make a compelling defense for your description of And as you say, as worded it would cover the case of a future OpenSSH modified to accommodate your iahad hypothetical.  Nonetheless, "arbitrarily large" isn't possible (cf. SSHBUF_SIZE_MAX and such) yet the duplication problem remains (it isn't reasonable for a user to expect that MaxAuthTries=6 allows password attempts).  A crisper and more accurate description of the current issue (sans hypotheticals) is the ability to trigger multiple queries to a given keyboard-interactive device within a single userauth request by having duplication in the device list.  >  > > The difference in behavior can be observed when the list contains > > repeats: > >  > > -oKbdInteractiveDevices="snap,snap,snap" > >  > > Pre-patch the above would query the snap device three times per > > userauth request while post-patch only once. >  > Yes; "the client shouldn't be able to specify an arbitrarily large > number of KbdInteractiveDevices and be entitled to have the server > cooperate" means that the vulnerable behavior was the server's > decision to cooperate with the client and execute a piece of code 3 > times (or, more importantly, times), when a more reasonable > behavior is to execute that piece of code only once. >  > > So, your hypothetical of: > >  > > > >  > > would work the same before and after the fix.

RFC leaves the interpretation of the submethod field of the userauth request up to the server implementation.   The right way to frame the question isn't whether there's a legitimate use of 7 devices and 6 auth tries resulting in 42 total queries but what MaxAuthTries is meant to restrict. If it isn't entirely clear from documentation (and maybe it isn't) that it's a bound on userauth requests then that is easy enough to fix in the manpage.  --mancha  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
