On Wed, Jul 22, at Andy Lutomirski wrote: > +++++ +++++ > +++++ +++++ > +++++ NMI bug, no CVE assigned +++++ > +++++ +++++  Red Hat folks, and Petr in particular - please post to this thread when you have statements on which RHEL kernels are affected by which of these issues.  RHEL kernels are upstream for several other distros/projects.  Finally, I'm afraid I have to remind you Andy that we have a policy in here to avoid CC'ing other mailing lists on oss-security postings (and vice versa), and especially not to do that with LKML:  http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security#list-content-guidelines  "Please don't cross-post messages to oss-security and other mailing lists at once, especially not to high-volume lists such as LKML and netdev, as this tends to result in threads that wander partially or fully off-topic (e.g., Linux kernel coding style detail may end up being discussed in comments to a patch posted to LKML, but it would be off-topic for oss-security).  If you feel that something needs to be posted to oss-security and to another list, please make separate postings.  You may mention the other posting(s) in your oss-security posting, and even link to other lists' archives."  The threads on linux-distros (where Andy first brought one of these issues on July 13) were very interesting, but they'd be beyond what all but very few oss-security subscribers need.  It would be "unaffordable" for most subscribers to read a hundred of messages in a few days on x86 NMI specifics and Linux kernel internals.  I guess your CC'ing LKML won't result in a similar thread being CC'ed in here, but it might, and if it does it'd be really tough for oss-security moderators to handle it well (accepting all such messages would be bad, and rejecting some also bad since it breaks the thread).  That said, the detail level of your posting is just right for this list, and I am looking forward to seeing you add more detail later as you wrote you intend to.  I am only worried about the uncontrolled CC's of future postings from the LKML side.  Thanks again,  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
