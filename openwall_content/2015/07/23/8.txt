Disallowing all duplication is one way to prevent this specific "arbitrarily large number" scenario. As we suggested in the iahad example, disallowing all duplication might break somebody's use case. (This is just theoretical; we haven't heard any reports of a problem.) Even if the patch is revised to allow a small amount of duplication, the definition of will stay the same.  > The difference in behavior can be observed when the list contains > repeats: >  > -oKbdInteractiveDevices="snap,snap,snap" >  > Pre-patch the above would query the snap device three times per userauth > request while post-patch only once.  Yes; "the client shouldn't be able to specify an arbitrarily large number of KbdInteractiveDevices and be entitled to have the server cooperate" means that the vulnerable behavior was the server's decision to cooperate with the client and execute a piece of code 3 times (or, more importantly, times), when a more reasonable behavior is to execute that piece of code only once.  > So, your hypothetical of: >  > >  > would work the same before and after the fix.

What we are saying is that we don't consider that specific behavior, after the fix, to be a separate vulnerability that requires a separate CVE ID. It is possible for someone to make an argument that the "42 device queries" behavior is inconsistent with the documentation and that the connection must be severed after 6 device queries. Although we currently don't agree with that argument, we consider the argument somewhat reasonable. That's why we chose to explicitly mention the case of a legitimate list of seven devices, and provide our perspective on whether we would support a second CVE request based on a claim of an incomplete fix.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJVsOQKAAoJEKllVAevmvmsdPEH/iDAntsGjUOC44KyKBJlewLW =ZK9C -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
