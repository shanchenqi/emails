The vulnerability was identified in the release version (http://golang.org/dl) and in the 1.5 release branch.  Patches have already been applied to the 1.5 release branch, and will be ported to the release branch. We will then create a release.  We are requesting a CVE ID in order to coordinate updates with distributions that include binary packages for the Go programming language. We will also announce and request that all Go programs using the net/http package that were compiled with version or earlier be recompiled with or 1.5 (when released) due to the static linking nature of the Go toolchain.  Please let me know if you need additional information.  Regards, Jason Buberel Product Manager, Go Google, Inc.
