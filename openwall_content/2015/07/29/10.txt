In this particular case, the reporter sent a messages to go-dev@...ang.org. That was then forwarded to me for handling.  And I agree on the bundling. Is there another specific issue that you're tracking? Feel free to contact me directly - jbuberel@...gle.com.  -jason  On Wed, Jul 29, at PM Florian Weimer <fweimer@...hat.com> wrote:  > On PM, Jason Buberel wrote: > > Hello OSS Security Community, > > > > The Go open source project has received notification of an HTTP request > > smuggling vulnerability in the net/http library ( > > http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/).
