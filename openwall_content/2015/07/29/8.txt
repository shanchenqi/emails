The plain SQL password and  username may be stored in the /logs/sql-error.log file. This directory  is publicly reachable under the default configuration/setup.  Notes ===== Some default URLs are: http://website.tld/froxlor/logs/sql-error.log http://cp.website.tld/logs/sql-error.log http://froxlor.website.tld/logs/sql-error.log  The certain section looks like this:   'DATABASE_USER',  'PLAIN_DATABASE_PW', Array)  Please note that the password in the logfile is truncated to 15 chars,  therefore passwords longer than 15 chars are not fully visible to an  attacker.   Patches ====== - log db errors to syslog instead of /logs/sql-error.log file:   - replace passwords even before logging:    Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
