All the major opinions have been stated already.  So far, we rejected only one posting to this thread - it consisted of the single word "Seconded." in support of one of the opinions.  Thus, everyone had ample opportunity to state their opinion (except merely "voting for" an opinion already stated).  After this point, we're going to start rejecting (likely) all or most further postings to this thread on this same topic.  So please stop.
