When parsing a JID, jabberd2 version and below truncate the data but do not verify whether the result is valid UTF8 before passing it to libidn. If the data ends with an unterminated multi-byte UTF8 sequence then libidn may copy data past the buffer into the result. This can be exploited by remote clients or remote servers.  Could you please assign a CVE for this issue?
