An attacker can remotely perform an Denial Of Service attack by  :sending a specially crafted email. No interaction form the user is  :needed to produce the crash just receive the malicious email. : :When the victim receives the malicious email, the application crashes  :while trying to download the email.The email application can not be used  :until the offending email is removed. : :The email version running on a Samsung Galaxy 4 mini fully  :updated (19 Jan is vulnerable. Newer versions are not  :affected.  FWIW, Android 5.0/Lollipop has removed this Email app and merged its functionality with the Gmail app.  I would argue that your calling the app the "Google email app" versus the "Android email app" would confuse things, but Google's done enough confusing here by having their Gmail app now do more than Gmail.  :)   --   Michael J.
