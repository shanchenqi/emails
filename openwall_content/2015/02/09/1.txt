The existence of the value does not provide access unless an autologin=1 request is sent within an administrative session. This issue is relevant mainly when a CSRF vulnerability exists. says:    Admin->Maintenance->Autologin. This new tab allows to select the   users that may autologin to the system via a simple link. Useful for   guest users but there are many others uses as well.  We do not think that intentionally setting up Autologin for an administrator is a common or plausible use case. If Autologin had been enabled for any other user account, the attacker would apparently need to know both the username and the account's creation date. Better salting would be an opportunity for security improvement. Accounts that would realistically be configured for Autologin are probably not high-value accounts, and the salt choice could be a security-versus-complexity tradeoff.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =g6vC -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
