By default, the wrapping key is hashed with the default fixed salt and stored in the a file. This was already noticed in bug : For  Ubuntu installations time-memory trade-off (rainbow tables, etc.) can apply, as well as bulk dictionary attacks to crack user passwords of Ubuntu installations when the home folder encryption is activated. I am currently working to correct this weakness.
