It is a different source code and fix. The source code is available in:  https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Email  Note that the HTTPParsers.cpp is the file which parses the headers but  in the Email App this is done by the MimeUtility.java.  It seems that the Chromium bug is very similar to the Email one, but I  think the attack vector is different since in the first case, it can be  exploited by sending an email and in the second case by visiting a website.
