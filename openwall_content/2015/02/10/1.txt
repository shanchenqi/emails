See . I'm still waiting for the CVE to be provided for from May, or could you let me know what CVE was assigned for the initial fix?  This fix was set to trigger an error if a user tried to set a value of filter_config_id through any means.  And in fact, it looking at the diff, my initial thought was you were trying to take a vulnerability discovered by myself and pass it off as something new crediting someone else and yourself for the fix - although it may be this was unintentional as it appears you re-introduced the same bug a few months after the initial fix.    If we look at the initial commit:   Line : $t_filter_config_value  = gpc_get_string( 'filter_config_id', META_FILTER_NONE ); Line : $t_filter_config_value  = $t_cookie_contents[2];  Lines to Line add the following code:  +if( !is_blank( $t_filter_config_value ) && (int)$t_filter_config_value !== META_FILTER_NONE ) { +	// check that config value exists +	if( @config_get_global( $t_filter_config_value ) === null ) { +		$t_cookie_path = config_get( 'cookie_path' ); +		gpc_clear_cookie( $t_cookie_name, $t_cookie_path ); + +		trigger_error( ERROR_GENERIC, ERROR ); +	} +}  The code block in lines to is executed on all code paths before display of any information to user.  It seems you then modified the fix for this vulnerability in August to re-introduce the vulnerability by moving the fix for the XSS issue in adm_config_page.php with filter_config_id being unchecked to a specific code path (i.e. only to apply to cookie values). See  And now are requesting a CVE for the new issue crediting a different research company for the 'new vulnerability', with no mention of the original discovery for this issue in May  @Mitre: How is this handled? Do you assign two CVE's in this case? Or could you confirm what CVE ID was initially issued for this fix which I can use when publishing the discovery information for this issue with the 31st May date.  Thanks Paul  -----Original Message----- From: Damien Regad [mailto:dregad@...tisbt.org]  Sent: 09 February To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: [oss-security] CVE request: XSS in MantisBT  Greetings,  Please assign a CVE ID for the following issue  Description:  The MantisBT Configuration Report (adm_config_report.php) did not properly sanitize the form variables used when saving a filter, allowing an attacker to embed JavaScript code which would be executed in the client's browser when displaying the page.
