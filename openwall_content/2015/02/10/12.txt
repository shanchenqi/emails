My view on all this is that pretty much anything wordexp-related is not CVE-worthy; wordexp simply is not a proper tool to be using in programs dealing with untrusted inputs -- either untrusted input strings, or untrusted environment contents. Obviously implementations using /bin/sh were vulnerable to shellshock on systems where /bin/sh is bash.
