And as with nginx and OpenSSL s3_srvr.c, there's no retval check on RAND_pseudo_bytes() when creating the IV to encrypt the session ticket.  This isn't exploitable with the default RNG (you won't get this far without a working RNG), but be careful if your engine is flaking out -  you could be sending something else out with your IVs...  For the record: -1 : Error, buffer not filled  0 : Buffer filled with potentially predictable entropy (unless an engine aliased their RAND_bytes interface to RAND_pseudo_bytes!)  1 : Success   Regards,   Michael  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
