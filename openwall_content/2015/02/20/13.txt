But wouldn't that make the libraries and executables less reliable?  They can pick up random libraries or cause some delays when one of the  relative paths points to a NFS mounted directory.  Any reason you can't change to using LD_LIBRARY_PATH for testing?  I've run into relative directories and even /net/xxx/ search paths but I  believe these should never be used as part of a binary distribution.
