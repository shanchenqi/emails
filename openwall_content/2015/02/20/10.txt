How is an empty or relative rpath easy? You have to explicitly add -Wl,-rpath,[whatever] to the linker command line. Most people don't even know this option exists, and those who do need to understand how it works or they're not going to get results that even work. If an rpath is needed and you accidentally make it cwd-relative rather than absolute or origin-relative, running your program is just going to fail when you're not in the 'right' working directory; this is such obvious breakage that it should be caught immediately by even basic testing.
