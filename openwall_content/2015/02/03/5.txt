You are right, gethostbyname is vulnerable too, but less. gethostbyname is implemented in It allocates buffer from heap, not stack, which is less danger.  Actually the bug is in __nss_hostname_digits_dots @ Is it much more complex and dangerous to overload __nss_hostname_digits_dots. Better upgrade to newer glibc.
