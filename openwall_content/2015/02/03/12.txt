Some additional info: This code is shared with cabextract. I recently also reported issues to the author that were all fixed in the cabextract 1.5 and libmspack 0.5alpha releases. (The author was unaware that I am not part of debian, so he only mentions Debian fixes in the release notes - but these include the fixes for the issues reported by me).  Rundown of issues I found:  Invalid read in ensure_filepath:  AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address at pc bp sp READ of size 1 at thread T0 #0 in ensure_filepath #1 in process_cabinet #2 in main     #3 in __libc_start_main     #4  Invalid in create_output_name: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address at pc bp sp READ of size 1 at thread T0 #0 in create_output_name #1 in process_cabinet     #2 in main     #3 in __libc_start_main     #4   All found with american fuzzy lop.  (P.S.: Do we have a policy on attachments on this list? I was unsure if it'd be apprechiated that I attach the issue-exposing samples)   cu, --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
