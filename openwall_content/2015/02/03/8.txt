By reviewing our mysql and mariadb issues we correlated this unknown issue to a bugreport submitted to us by an external researcher.    The bugreport also has a reproducer.  Stefan "nordi" Nordhausen reported this issue to both Oracle and to us on 7th of January  Oracle fixed it in their CPU. MariaDB fixed it in I think.   We had sadly lacked disclosure timeline control on this issue and reactions on Oracle side were also, errm, delayed.
