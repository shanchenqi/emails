An (older) copy of libmspack is also embedded in ClamAV (not verified if this version is also affected by these issues).  The reported bugs are the following:  null pointer dereference on a crafted CAB:  -  CHM decompression: division by zero  -  CHM decompression: pointer arithmetic overflow  -  off-by-one buffer over-read in mspack/mszipd.c  -  off-by-one buffer under-read in mspack/lzxd.c  -  CHM decompression: another pointer arithmetic overflow  -  Could CVEs be assigned for these issues?
