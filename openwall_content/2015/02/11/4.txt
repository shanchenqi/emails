Changing environment variables is not compliant with the prevalent interpretation of of POSIX, and as a result, at least glibc will not change its behavior.  This means that AT_SECURE programs such as sudo need to implement proper filtering.  I will obtain clarification from the Austin Group that scrubbing environment variables in the implementation name space is allowed, and then we can revisit this matter as far as glibc is concerned.  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
