Hello.  I'm upstream.     Thanks for the report.  I may be easily swayed, but I agree.  I was more worried about the buffer-overflow problems, and did not carefully analyze this part of the patch.  As I read the spec (for OS/2), eb_size should include the 4-byte eb_ucsize value (eb_cmpr_offs = EB_OS2_HLEN -> compr_offset), the 6-byte compressed-data header (2-byte compression method plus 4-byte CRC = EB_CMPRHEADLEN), and the eb_ucsize bytes of compressed (well, STOREd, actually) data.     Part of the fun here is that I have no easy access to an actual OS/2 (or AtheOS, or BeOS, or pre-OS-X Mac, or ...) system, which makes it tough to run a real test on this code.  (The rest of the world is probably in the same boat, so it's not clear that anyone would ever notice this, but it can't hurt (much) to make it correct.)     Unless someone talks me out of it soon, I'll make some equivalent change to the replacement extract.c (and the current development edition), and throw it into the pile here.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------     Steven M.
