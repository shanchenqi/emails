To elaborate on the above, the RATIONALE text reads:      "While wordexp() could be implemented entirely as a library     routine, it is expected that most implementations run a shell in a     subprocess to do the expansion."  Source:  In addition to the allowance of shell-based implementations, the text of the standard puts a burden on the calling application not to pass certain dangerous strings:      "... Therefore, the application shall ensure that words does not     contain an unquoted <newline> character or any of the unquoted     shell special characters '|', '&', ';', '<', '>' except in the     context of command substitution as specified in XCU Command     Substitution."  However, later in the DESCRIPTION, the following text appears, which seems to specify a behavior for this case:      "If the implementation supports the utilities defined in the Shell     and Utilities volume of and words contains an     unquoted character- <newline>, '|', '&', ';', '<', '>' , '(', ')',     '{', '}' - in an inappropriate context, wordexp() shall fail, and     the number of expanded words shall be 0."  Read together, this seems to require conforming implementations to detect bad characters, but also requires conforming applications not to pass them; one or the other of these requirements is rather useless, then.  In any case, I would hope all of the above serves as sufficient warning that you should not pass untrusted input to wordexp. :-)  Rich  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
