What about things like -Wl,-rpath=/tmp ?  That one is particularly egregious and, as Casper mentioned, there are other ways of getting stupid RPATHs.  I've seen a fair number of them :)  Would it be useful to check to see if and rpath directory is not writable by the someone other than the uid/euid?  Of course, it does nothing for an RPATH that goes over NFS.  The Fedora packaging guidelines forbid the use of rpath completely which is beginning to look more and more attractive.  jch   -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =mnPH -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
