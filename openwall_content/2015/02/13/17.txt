A typical use case of GnuPG is a single session with a single command line. The code in question is not part of Libgcrypt, which may be used for long-running processes.  Do you mean that:    1. it is possible to create the problematic keyring      using --import commands, e.g., the user has      imported normal keys for years and now imports      a crafted key    2. the problematic keyring makes the product largely      unusable, e.g., there is a crash with a common      command such as --list-keys    3. it is not possible to fix the problematic keyring      with any available commands such as --delete-keys    4. therefore, the product remains unusable unless the      user obtains other code to correct the keyring, and      thus there is a denial of service  ?  If the situation were something like:    1. the problematic keyring cannot be created using      --import commands; the issue is specific to a     new keyring that a user obtains from an untrusted     source    2. there is a crash in some situation    3. the user can avoid the impact by discontinuing      use of this new keyring  then we think that a CVE ID may not be applicable.  Also, access to each of your four crashes.fuzzing-project.org URLs currently fails with a We can probably provide at least two CVE IDs in total after those URLs are available.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =lEJf -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
