I previously had fuzzed GnuPG which had led to the detection of a Buffer Overflow vulnerability in GnuPG and libksba Recently I tried to fuzz less obvious inputs of GnuPG: Keyrings and configuration files.  GnuPG allows to specify a non-standard keyring on the command line. Fuzzing GPG with gpg --export --no-default-keyring --keyring [input keyring] led to the detection of various issues. (Please note that the keyring parameter needs the full path and does not like filenames with unusual characters like the ones generated by american fuzzy lop.)  NULL pointer deref in parse_trust (parse-packet.c)  NULL pointer deref in do_key (build-packet.c)  Use after free (build-packet.c)  memcpy with overlapping ranges (keybox_search.c)  All issues found with american fuzzy lop. Fuzzing of the configuration file parser showed no issues.  While keyrings are usually not user-submitted data, some of these can be reached through other code paths. None of the issues looks severe, however judging the exact security would require further analysis.
