Why does sudo run the target program with both effective and real ids set to root? Why not run with only the effective uid set to root? Then the program would know that it's being run by an unprivileged user with elevated privileges (and its libc would restrict or ignore environment variables for internal libc use). Does such invocation break too many programs?  Rich  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
