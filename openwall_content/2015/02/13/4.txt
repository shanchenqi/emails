The issue is that the stack for processes is not properly  randomized on some 64 bit architectures due to an integer overflow.  Affected systems have reduced the stack entropy of the processes by four.   Details at: http://hmarco.org/bugs/linux-ASLR-integer-overflow.html    Could you please assign a CVE-ID for this?
