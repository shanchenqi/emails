Does such invocation > break too many programs?  Unfortunately running setuid can result in undesirable behavior with some programs, especially those that are already setuid.  For example, things like "sudo passwd" or "sudo crontab" would no longer work.  Sudo does have a "stay_setuid" setting that will run programs with the user's real uid but it is not widely used.   - todd  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
