I've not yet done an announcement for this fix as it's not gone into a release.  It's listed as the fix @ however, that changeset has never been tagged against 1.2.

A 5 seconds search through the MantisBT changesets tells me that it was See  Which, by the way, would have been even easier for you to find if you had actually bothered to follow the process and report the security issue in our tracker yourself instead of emailing me that PDF file of yours and making me do the legwork.   > And in fact, it looking at the diff, my initial thought was you were  > trying to take a vulnerability discovered by myself and pass it off  > as something new crediting someone else and yourself for the fix -  > although it may be this was unintentional as it appears you  > re-introduced the same bug a few months after the initial fix.  You know, this really sounds like paranoia... You know me, and should know better. I have never taken credit for somebody else's work.

Do you assign two CVE's in this case?  As far as I can tell, while related, these are indeed 2 distinct issues even though they are evidently related.  Quite frankly, I just can't be bothered to analyze whether my follow-up fix for reintroduced the issue or not.  Even if I did, the fact remains that was released as it was, so we DO have two distinct issues here in any case.
