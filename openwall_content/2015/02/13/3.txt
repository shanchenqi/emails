Joseph Myers discovered strxfrm is vulnerable to integer overflows when computing memory allocation sizes (similar to i.e. in string/strxfrm_l.c:    idxarr = (int32_t *) malloc ((srclen + 1) * (sizeof (int32_t) + 1));  Attached strxfrm-int32.c should trigger on 32-bit machines.  2. Shaun Colley discovered strxfrm falls back to an unbounded alloca if malloc fails making it vulnerable to stack-based buffer overflows (similar to [1]. Attached strxfrm-alloca.c should trigger.   Both issues were fixed in glibc [2] and a quick check shows vulnerable code appears to go back to at least glibc 2.3.  Please allocate CVEs for these issues. Many thanks.  --mancha  ==============  [1] [2]  View attachment "strxfrm-alloca.c" of type "text/plain" bytes)  View attachment "strxfrm-int32.c" of type "text/plain" bytes)  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
