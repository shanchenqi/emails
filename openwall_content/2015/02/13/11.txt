I found reflecting XSS-vulnerabilities, a unrestricted file-upload and underlaying CSRF-vulnerabilities in CMS Landsknecht Adminsystems v. (DEV, beta version).  Technical details:  ======================= Reflecting XSS-vulnerabilities =======================  A reflecting XSS vulnerability can be found in the index.php and can be abused via the vulnerable "page"-parameter. See the following example, including exploit-example:  http://  Another reflecting XSS vulnerability can be found in the system.php-file and can be exploited via the vulnerable "id" parameter:  http://  ================================== Unrestricted file-upload / Underlaying CSRF ==================================  Registered users and administrators are able to upload arbitrary files via the following upload-form, located here:  http://{TARGET}/asys/site/files.php?action=upload&path=/  As there seems not be an existing permission-model, users can read/execute files  an administrator/user uploaded and vice versa.  This issue includes an underlaying CSRF-vulnerability, as a user is able to upload a malicious file and trick another user or the administrator into visiting the link to the file.  All files get uploaded here without being renamed:  http://{TARGET}/upload/files/{UPLOADED_FILE}   Can I please have a CVE-ID / CVE-IDs for this issue?  Thank you very much.  Greetings from Germany.
