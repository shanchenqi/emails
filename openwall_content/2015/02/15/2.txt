This kind of room for improvement in the ASLR implementation doesn't seem like it's worthy of a CVE. There are many ways of making it more fine grained, but there are diminishing returns. This won't help if there are usable ROP gadgets in the application code.  AFAIK, it didn't attempt / claim to offer this level of granularity, so it's not the same as something like the vdso issue where an expected exploit mitigation was totally broken.  It could also add a gap between each library and do more than just base randomization for mmap... but it's an endless rabbit hole and at some point the costs become significant, while the gains are dubious.
