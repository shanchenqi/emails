The report is apparently about ignoring GnuTLSClientVerify when this directive is present in a directory context, whereas is apparently about ignoring GnuTLSClientVerify when this directive is present only in a server config context. is apparently discussing the bug when saying "This bug still exists in current stable and unstable packages" but perhaps is actually referring to a remaining issue that exists because of an incomplete fix for the bug.  The report seems to imply that that verification problem is an impact of a bug related to improper "rehandshake" handling Also, suggests that the verification problem is observed with some browsers but not others, which might mean that sessions with certain browsers (or browsers with certain SSL configurations) do not end up having a "rehandshake." has no mention of "rehandshake" or anything similar, and instead apparently blames the problem on "the authentication hook (mgs_hook_authz)." Similarly, the patch (i.e., seems to be a fix for a missing check in the patch (i.e., the http://issues.outoforder.cc/file_download.php?file_id=34&type=bug patch).  The various discussion of "when I browse site2 in IE, it shows me the certificate of site1" and "it seems curl extension of php also can't correctly connect" in is possibly a user error and not a valid third vulnerability report.  So, are you looking for:    one ID  -- vulnerability involving the directory context    one ID  -- vulnerability involving the server config context  ?  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =nfvd -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
