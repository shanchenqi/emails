Here's the bug report:   Here's the latest iteration of the patch:   This is not only something that software developers will expect to work, but AFAIK it has always been intended to work. I don't think there's any disagreement that this is a bug. Leaving the directory tree writable when it's supposed to be read-only without reporting an error is very problematic.  The widely used workaround (among people who realize it doesn't work) is to remount the bind mount as read-only. That can open up a race and it also doesn't mix well with MS_REC. The remount call will only apply the read-only flag to the top-level mount despite MS_REC.  In systemd, there are various features suffering from security flaws due to this kernel bug. The ReadOnlyDirectories for units only applies to the top-level mount and systemd-nspawn's --bind-ro switch doesn't make the submounts read-only. The flaws in systemd are documented so a CVE assignment for those issues wouldn't make sense. I think they'd be willing to fix these if the underlying kernel bug is dealt with.
