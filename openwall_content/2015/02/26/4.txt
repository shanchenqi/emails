Akamai advisory:  These vulns have not seen CVEs as far as I can see. They have been fixed in 3.1. This is the developers announcement: http://tech.reumer.net/Google-Maps/Documentation-of-plugin-Googlemap/security-release-3-1-of-plugin-googlemaps.html  And here are some more details:  1 Denial of Service / reflection issue (this seems the one akamai is most concerned about) 1 XML injection 2 XSS 1 path disclosure 1 anti automation (not sure this counts as a vulnerability)  I've added detection to freewvs [1] (which is btw a tool you might find interesting, although its functionality overlaps with a similar tool called pyfiscan and there are some preliminary plans to maybe merge the development work of the two in the future).
