This seems to be easily fixed by proper configuration (i.e. having soap.wsdl_cache_dir set to a directory accessible only to the user running PHP, or, on the shared host, having per-user config for each user) but I'm not sure how to fix it in the generic case since that directory wouldn't exist by default. On specific package - like RH - it could create a separate directory - like /tmp/php-wsdl-cache - with web server permissions and set the variable to use it - but since default PHP install has no install scripts not sure yet how to improve it in a generic way. --  Stas Malyshev smalyshev@...il.com  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
