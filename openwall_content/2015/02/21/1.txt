The short answer is that is a new CVE ID that is about the specific portion of the original May adm_config_report.php discovery that remains present in version and  The meaning of has now been changed to the specific portion of the original May adm_config_report.php discovery that was already fixed in version  The set of CVE assignments has been arranged this way because it corresponds to a standard pattern in which one vulnerability report is made, the vendor releases changed code that turns out to be an incomplete fix for the vulnerability, and then a second vulnerability report is made that corresponds to a valid attack against the changed code. This matches some of the principal details of the current situation, e.g.,    one vulnerability report is made:      adm_config_page.php had an XSS issue with filter_config_id being unchecked      (see - this is       a discussion of the original report; it is not the original report       itself)    the vendor releases changed code:      - In 1.3, cabacdc2 + together form at least a *partial* fix for        [the above vulnerability report] (released in      - In 1.2, is a combination of the above 2 (released in      (see    a second vulnerability report is made that corresponds to a valid   attack against the changed code:      (see  The following items, although significant to understanding the situation as a whole, do not directly affect the set of CVE assignments:    1. The development of the      change, which was apparently a complete fix for all aspects of      the problem.    2. The commit of on May 31,      which apparently would have fixed all aspects of the      problem if a user deployed a MantisBT installation based on the      latest May 31, github code, instead of one based on a      MantisBT release.    3. The specific way in which      was transformed into an      incomplete fix (e.g., by moving a code block so that it affected      only a single code path).    4. The original meaning of the ID.    5. The possibility that the discovery relied, in part,      on previously published information, rather than exclusively new      analysis.  The reason that this set of CVE assignments is unusual is that, in a common "incomplete fix" situation, the reason for issuing a release with an incomplete fix is that nobody recognized how to fix the entire problem. In those situations, it is typically not necessary to adjust the meaning of the original CVE, because that CVE usually captures everything that was originally known about the problem. Here, apparently one or more persons knew that was the complete fix, but the release still did not ship with that complete fix.  Finally, to anticipate two questions:    A. We do not plan to change      to      state that and are affected versions.      is now specifically about types of attacks that are successful      against but are not successful against or    B. Discoverer information for CVEs is not determined or published by      MITRE. We think the most likely scenario is that the original      discoverer of was Paul Richards, whereas      was independently discovered by both Paul Richards      and FortiGuard Labs. Other possibilities exist.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =tjY7 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
