I found multiple reflecting XSS-, SQLi- and InformationDisclosure-vulnerabilities in ECommerce Shopping-Cart Zeuscart v.4.  ==== XSS ====  Reflecting XSS-vulnerabilities can be found in a common Zeuscart-installation in the following locations and could be exploited for example by crafting a link and make a registered user click on that link.  The parameter "search", which is used in the index.php is vulnerable to XSS-attacks.  Exploit-Example:  http://   By appending arbitrary HTML- and/or JavaScript-code to the parameter "schltr" which is as well used in index.php, an attacker could exploit this XSS-vulnerable parameter:  Exploit-Example:  http://   The third XSS-vulnerability can be found in the "brand"-parameter, which is again used in index.php.  Exploit-Example:  http://   ==== SQLi ====  The SQL injection-vulnerabilities can be found in the administrative backend of Zeuscart v. 4 and reside in the following locations in a common installation.  By appending arbitrary SQL statements to the "id"-parameter, an attacker could exploit this SQL injection vulnerability:  Exploit-Example:  http://   Another SQL injection vulnerability can be found here and can be exploited by appending SQL statements to the vulnerable "cid"-parameter:  Exploit-Example:  http://   The last SQL injection vulnerability I found can be found in the following location and can be exploited by appending SQL statements to the vulnerable "id" parameter:  http://   ============== Information Disclosure ==============  The administrative backend of Zeuscart v. 4 allows the admin to use a functionality, which displays the PHP-installation settings via phpinfo():  http://{TARGET}/admin/?do=getphpinfo  Unfortunately, the PHP-script does not check, if an authorized admin executes this functionality: It is possible even for unregistered users to request the above link to see the informations, phpinfo() displays. That could expose sensitive informations to an attacker which could lead to further exploitation.  Can I have a CVE-ID / CVE-IDs for these issues?  Thank you very much.  Greetings from Germany.
