For example, if only jabberd2 is changed, then libidn still has an out-of-bounds read issue with input from other programs. If only libidn were changed and (for example) the change was to fail on invalid UTF-8 data, then that would have a DoS effect on jabberd2.  Did you believe that libidn does not have a vulnerability on its own?  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =MZLy -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
