Thank you for your reply.

From the results of my researches, I can say, that there only exists one group that has administrative rights, called „Admin“. The first administrators-account, which gets created during the installation-process has the name „System Admin“, but as far as I checked, this account has no more rights than any other administrator-account created afterwards. They are all in the group „Admin“.  > We think the situation is: >  > In other words, you are not reporting any discoveries in > which an attacker is directly bypassing access control.

I think any person with access to an administrative account could enter the XSS intentionally, for example to compromise other admin-accounts. I logged in with an administrative account which has been created after the installation and exploited the stored XSS in severity.php („description“ input field). The XSS has been executed on severity.php, when the „System Admin“-account has been logged in and visited this site.  > 3.

I am not able to give you more information on these issues.  > 5.
