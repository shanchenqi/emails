Use for this jabberd2 vulnerability in which truncation fails to preserve the validity of the input, because the truncation occurs on a byte boundary that is not necessarily a character boundary. (The resulting invalid input has security-relevant mishandling within the current version of a required library, and it's reasonable to expect that security-relevant mishandling could occur in other cases.)  > If the data ends with an unterminated multi-byte UTF8 > sequence then libidn may copy data past the buffer into the result.  >  > the stringprep functions from libidn require the input to be valid UTF8  > The libidn documentation claims "This function will not read or write > to characters outside that size." about the length of the buffer that > needs to be specified, but this is not true,  Use for this libidn out-of-bounds read issue. Possibly it could be argued that this is a borderline case for a CVE. However, the documentation says "This function will not read or write to characters outside that size" rather than "If the input is valid UTF-8, then this function will not read or write to characters outside that size." If the input is not valid UTF-8, then the function is entitled to undefined behavior within the bounds of the buffer.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =cEQY -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
