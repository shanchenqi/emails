After reviewing this blog post [1] it's much clearer now, but I'm still a bit fuzzy on if "session caching" and "session IDs" (RFC TLS 1.2) -- also as identified by Qualys SSLLabs line item "Session resumption (caching)" -- are the same; is the Session Cache caching session IDs? I only ask because I know that webservers have had SSL Session Cache features for years, but RFC is TLS 1.2 in its entirety and I believe I've seen this feature predate TLS 1.2. Was session caching / IDs always part of the SSL/TLS spec, now superseded by the newer TLS 1.2 RFC?  If I'm understanding that correctly the following would be true: the use of session caching is not a known vulnerability, but the use of session tickets is a potential vulnerability. The design of the session tickets (RFC appears to solve a specific problem: reducing expensive TLS renegotiation when you have a cluster of servers and the session is not guaranteed to stick to a specific server/load balancer. Additionally OpenSSL lacks key rotation for session tickets, so it seems safe to assume all software using OpenSSL with session tickets enabled are likely not working around this problem by enforcing their own key rotation.  This feels like a feature that should always be turned off unless your environment absolutely requires it; especially if you have measurable performance impact / negative client experience without it.
