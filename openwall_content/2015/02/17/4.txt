This was discovered on Ubuntu LTS (amd64) with package unzip version with the help of afl [2]. This vulnerability could possibly lead to arbitrary code execution.  The problem lies in the "unix/unix.c:charset_to_intern()" function which is part of the patch (Ubuntu reference [3]). It can be triggered during string conversion from to UTF-8 for which the destination buffer is not large enough.  The problematic code is present in: - Info-ZIP beta/development release version - Ubuntu unzip package (see version numbers in advisory [0]) - FreeBSD archivers/unzip port (depending on the port configuration)  Timeline: - Ubuntu contacted, CVE assigned, disclosure date defined - FreeBSD & Upstream contacted - Openwall distros mailing list notified - Public disclosure  An updated iconv patch (received from Ubuntu) is available at [4].
