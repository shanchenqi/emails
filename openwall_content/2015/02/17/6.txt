A handcrafted file could lead the de-compressor to access beyond bounds leading to crash because the compiler might have removed the boundary check. The boundary remains there up to the gcc 4.7 series. Starting with gcc 4.8 the compiler removes the check because it assumes that a signed overflow can not become negative. According to the gcc folks this assumption is within the C specification. As a fix [2] one of the variables becomes unsigned and is part of the current release.  This bug has been discovered by AFL [3], american fuzzy lop.
