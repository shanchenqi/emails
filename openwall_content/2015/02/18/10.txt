Additionally, on enabled Linux systems, DES or MD5 encrypted passwords passed to crypt() fail with EPERM (w/ NULL return).  It was discovered by Ken Milnore that xrdp and earlier, when validating user accounts against plain passwd files or via shadow-utils, does not check for NULL returns from crypt(). [1]  --- sesman/verify_user.c ---   encr = crypt(pass,salt);   if (g_strncmp(encr, hash, 34) != 0)   {     return 0;   }   return 1; ----------------------------  A NULL return crashes the xrdp-sesman daemon resulting in an xrdp server denial of service (for all modules that use xrdp's session manager for user authentication via old-style passwd files or via shadow passwords).  This has been fixed by upstream in its development branch. [2]  Please allocate a CVE for this issue.
