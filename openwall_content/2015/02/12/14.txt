Mention CVE and XSA numbers in patch commit message.  Public release.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  When decoding a guest write to a specific register in the virtual interrupt controller Xen would treat an invalid value as a critical error and crash the host.  IMPACT ======  By writing an invalid value to the GICD.SGIR register a guest can crash the host, resulting in a Denial of Service attack.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen 4.5 and later systems running on ARM hardware with version 2 of the generic interrupt controller are vulnerable.  Systems running on ARM hardware with version 3 of the generic interrupt controller are not vulnerable.  x86 systems are not affected.  MITIGATION ==========  None.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Julien Grall.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.         Xen 4.5.x, xen-unstable  $  $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =edQs -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
