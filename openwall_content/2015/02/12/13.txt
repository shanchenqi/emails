That's sufficient for a CVE; use  > There are really two issues here: exposure of TZ parsing bugs and > access to arbitrary (potentially user-controlled) files.

The scope of is limited to the undesired ability of an attacker to trigger an open call for a pathname outside the zoneinfo directory (whether this is done with an absolute pathname or a relative pathname). The scope of does not include blocking other types of invalid or potentially malicious TZ values. For example:  > It is longer than the value of PATH_MAX.  It seems simple to envision a program for which a length of PATH_MAX-2 triggers a buffer overflow. Even if such a program were known, we wouldn't want to assign a CVE ID to sudo on the basis that PATH_MAX-2 isn't blocked.  >  > Procmail is another program that recklessly whitelists TZ  Use for the similar issue in procmail.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =bEKj -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
