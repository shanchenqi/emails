It mandates a few sanity bound-checks (for both the values of exponents and exponentials) that some implementations are not doing...  Can you please assign three CVEs for the following bugs?  PuTTY will be fixed in the upcoming release I think) - The exponential is not checked for trivial values  Dropbox fixed in: - The exponential is not checked for all trivial values (it just does what the RFC mandates, which is clearly not enough!) - The exponent picked might be a trivial value (this is theoretical more than anything else assuming the CSPRNG is working). It's a regression from  Further details and a full advisory will be published at  when the patches are in a released build. Our current understanding is that no third party can take advantage of those bugs unless both the client and the server are vulnerable AND either side picks a weak exponent. The likelihood of that happening in practice is almost nil and the impact limited in any case.
