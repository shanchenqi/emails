The ability of one admin account to enter XSS intentionally, in order to compromise another equivalent admin account, does not inherently cross privilege boundaries and is not inherently eligible for a CVE ID. However, if the vendor specifically announces that a "vulnerability" fix has been made for such an issue, MITRE typically defers to the vendor's judgment that the issue is actually a violation of the product's security policy, and therefore is within the scope of CVE. The existence of a vendor commit with a fix, however, does not (by itself) establish a security policy.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =MB+v -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
