(For example, http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ecryptfs/ecryptfs/trunk/view/head:/doc/beginners_guide/ecryptfs_beginners_guide.tex says "It is highly advised that you also provide a salt along with the password, which will help make an attack against your files harder than if you use the default salt.")  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =RVyA -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
