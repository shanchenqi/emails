I'm wondering what the actual impact of this issue is supposed to be. Why would any of the uids inside the container have write access to a shared filesystem on which their uids are presumably not even meaningful? It seems to me like this would only affect world-writable files/directories on the shared filesystem, which sound like a bad idea to begin with.
