I've already been in contact with the pngcrush author and this bug has been fixed in pngcrush (which was released today, no mention of this in the changelog though:  It was found with AFL (http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl) and I compiled pngcrush as follows:  Edited Makefile to point to afl-gcc binary then ran AFL_HARDEN=1 make -j12.

This likely indicates a write access violation, which means the attacker may control the write address and/or value.
