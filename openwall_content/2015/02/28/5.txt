The vendor is specifically announcing this as "This is a security vulnerability." (Also, wiping private-key memory is a conventional behavior seen in many products. It is not the same as wiping any memory block that any researcher may feel is sensitive in some way.)  > http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/wishlist/private-key-not-wiped-2.html  > However, if you ever told Pageant to delete a key from memory, it > would not have properly deleted it: it would still have retained a > copy by mistake due to this bug.  Because of the "this bug" wording, a single CVE ID is assigned. However, in general, these two cases could be distinguished:    - violating a user's reasonable expectations about what preemptive     memory wiping should occur    - providing a UI feature advertised as a way to tell a product to     wipe a key from memory, accompanied by actual behavior in which no     wiping occurs  with separate CVE IDs. In other words, there would be two CVE IDs if there were two bugs (one for each case) fixed independently.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =aQwW -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
