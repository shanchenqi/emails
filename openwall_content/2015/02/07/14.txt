Hi,  We were contacted in retrospect by a researcher about this blog entry he'd written and published:   and I haven't seen anything flying across this list, so I thought I'd bring it to people's attention here.  There's a fix in NetBSD HEAD for this, and it will flow out to the release branches in due course.  I have to admit we're having a hard time trying to think of a service that exposes regcomp(3) over the internet - there's a reason that Google did re2 for Google code, after all - but I may well be missing something...
