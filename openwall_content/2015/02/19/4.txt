I respectfully disagree due to the fact that FreeBSD gives explicit instructions on running current:   and even places it above using -stable in the order in the book. Looking at the instructions:  To track FreeBSD-CURRENT:  Join the freebsd-current and the svn-src-head lists. This is essential in order to see the comments that people are making about the current state of the system and to receive important bulletins about the current state of FreeBSD-CURRENT.  if you look at those mailing lists you will see there are a ton of posters, so obviously more than a few people are using this.  Any ways just my 5 cents, I don't think it's a good precedent to set that "oh the vendor says this is beta/not supported/etc so no CVE" when:  1) a lot of people use it (e.g. Google Chrome was a "beta", but it  had several million users so it got CVEs) 2) the affected timeframe was quite significant (4 months, so for yearly key roll over that's 1/3 of the population affected) 3) the problem can linger on despite the system being updated (e.g. any certs/keys need to be re-generated).     --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
