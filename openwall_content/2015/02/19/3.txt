If anyone on the FreeBSD Security Officer Team believes that this, for whatever reason, is a case where FreeBSD-CURRENT should have a CVE, we are willing to go with their preference.  > quite a few people run -current (and it's a 4 month affected window), > so if we're assigning CVE's to stuff hosted in github, then it seems > fair  A project on github can be a software product if the developers choose to use github that way. FreeBSD-CURRENT is, for example, advertised as "any given commit is just as likely to introduce new bugs as to fix existing ones" (https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/handbook/current-stable.html). The defined use cases for FreeBSD-CURRENT don't suggest that it has any expected behavior, security-wise or otherwise: it is just a point in the development process. Also, we don't happen to know of situations where third parties repackage and support FreeBSD-CURRENT code (e.g., as the embedded OS of an appliance).  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJU5V/UAAoJEKllVAevmvmswX0IAJvlnDzjyPxNgRbkZbMkqBlP =6XgW -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
