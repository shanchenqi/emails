The keybox_search.c report says "memcpy with overlapping ranges" but the listed commit apparently fixes "sign extension on shift" issues.  We suspect that what you mean is that the commits are directly applicable as listed, and the difference is that your report states the ultimate impact found by afl-fuzz, and your report isn't intended to directly show how that ultimate impact results from the code problem.  With this interpretation:    - Use after free, resulting from failure to skip                   invalid packets    - memcpy with overlapping ranges, resulting from                   incorrect bitwise left shifts  There's currently no information suggesting that the NULL pointer dereference issues could have a security impact; they currently do not have CVE IDs.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =LLyD -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
