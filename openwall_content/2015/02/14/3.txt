As an optimization, zpaq will translate the ZPAQL code into x86 or The vulnerability is versions and earlier of libzpaq, an API that provides the compression and decompression services to zpaq and possibly other applications. One vulnerability allows a specially crafted archive to write past the end of an array on the heap. Another allows execution of the generated x86 or to fall off the end of the program and execute unallocated memory. Both bugs can be triggered by extracting or just listing a specially crafted archive. I did not investigate whether these bugs could be exploited, but it seems possible. The patched zpaq and libzpaq are available at the above website.  --  -- Matt Mahoney, mattmahoneyfl@...il.com  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
