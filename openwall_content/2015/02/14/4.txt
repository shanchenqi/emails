I think I haven't posted this here yet: Also recently fuzzed flac with afl and found something:   Crashing sample is attached to the bug report.  What happens is that flac does an malloc for the number of comments. If that fails due to an insane number of comments it'll fail, but it will still try to access the non-allocated memory.  I think the upstream fix is not optimal - it limits the amount of allowed comments. That probably fixes this in most situations, but it still leaves problems, because it doesn't check for malloc failures.  cu, --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
