We think this means anyone can execute a file regardless of who uploaded it. Do you mean that a file uploaded by a user can ONLY be executed by an administrator or different user, whereas a file uploaded by an administrator can ONLY be executed by a user?  > This issue includes an underlaying CSRF-vulnerability, as a user is able to > upload a malicious file and trick another user or the administrator into > visiting the link to the file.  We're not sure whether you mean the CSRF concept is relevant in a way that is unusual for an "upload arbitrary files" issue.  If the attacker can upload a file, with the upload location and/or file extension allowing execute access, then the typical outcome is that exactly that file is executed. It is not typically the case that a product modifies uploaded files to insert a CSRF protection mechanism. Also, it is not typically the case that a pathname such as /upload/files/{UPLOADED_FILE} would actually execute a wrapper program (containing a CSRF protection mechanism) before executing UPLOADED_FILE itself.  For these reasons, the ability to upload executable files to /upload/files/{UPLOADED_FILE} would normally be considered a single vulnerability, and would not lead to a conclusion that the product has an independent CSRF problem.  Also, the primary threat model for "upload arbitrary files" issues is that the file uploading and the file execution are done by the same person. Certainly, it could be interesting to upload JavaScript code and trick an administrator into executing it. However, if the attacker can upload and execute PHP code without any tricking, ability to upload JavaScript is usually not considered an independently relevant problem. In common (but not all) cases, given an attacker's "upload arbitrary files" ability, the entire class of scenarios in which the file is later executed by a different person isn't independently relevant.  So, we think one CVE for the two XSS issues, and one CVE for file upload, is the correct number. Do you have another interpretation?  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJU3pRRAAoJEKllVAevmvmszRgIAKTqAfCFqlHNnWIZtADfF6Gk =Iqmo -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
