The whole idea is to write something that you can bounce back to the prompt.  lTerminal is pretty limiting. An attacker would have to also place the file  lTerminal in the search path before using this trick. But if they can do pre- place a file in the search path, they can also take advantage of typing  mistakes like placing a file vo and then waiting for the admin to make a  mistake typing vi.  What you really want to do in an attack is to  try placing a call back shell  command on the prompt or download/upload files.  Most terminal emulators, konsole for example, reply with nothing. Its the vte  based ones that reply like this.  -Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
