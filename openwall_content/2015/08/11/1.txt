I discovered a flaw that accidentally allows access to a connected USB printer via all configured network addresses, rather than only TCP loopback addresses, by misusing the in6addr_any bind address.  The original bug report is at (though most of the contents aren't related).  The flaw can be found at  Comments in the source code and documentation indicate that access was intended only for localhost:  Till Kamppeter has provided the following patches to address the issue:  The first patch switches to using two sockets and binds them explicitly to the IPv6 and the IPv4 loopback addresses; the second patch simplifies the use of select(). Both patches are recommended. A new upstream release will be made soon to incorporate this fix.
