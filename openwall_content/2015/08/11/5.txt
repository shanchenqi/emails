This has nothing to do with us not fixing flaws just because they don't  get a CVE. I assure you that we've fixed security flaws that had no CVEs  before. And if you look through our CVE database, you'll find many  examples of simple crashers that unfortunately got a CVE, which we did  not fix. The main reason for not fixing it for now is that we think 80 bits of  randomness is enough for most applications up to this day, especially if  it's session data and not permanent storage, etc. Therefore we classify  this issue as having a Low security impact. If a CVE is assigned for  this issue, we will create an entry in our CVE database but the end  result will likely be the same, wontfix.  --  Adam Maris / Red Hat Product Security   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
