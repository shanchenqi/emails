During the compilation of a malformed regular expression, more data is written on the malloced block than the expected size output by compile_regex(). The Heap Overflow vulnerability is caused by the following regular expression.  /(?J:(?|(:(?|(?'R')(\z(?|(?'R')(\k'R')|((?'R')))k'R')|((?'R')))H'Ak'Rf)|s(?'R')))/  A dry run of this particular regular expression with pcretest will reports "double free or corruption (!prev)". But it is actually a heap overflow problem. The overflow only affects pcre 8.x branch, pcre2 branch is not affected.  This is a different issue from  Reference:  Please allocate a CVE-ID for this.
