An attacker could repeatedly execve chfn as "ld.so" until mkostemp() creates "/etc/ld.so.preload" (after a few days, in our tests).  This particular example doesn't actually work, because "preload" is 7 chars and "XXXXXX" is 6 chars, but it seems there are other interesting possibilities, like "/etc/rc.status" and "/etc/krb5.keytab".  The impact of this vulnerability is probably very limited: most Linux distributions ship either the chfn/chsh binaries from the shadow-utils (NOT the login-utils ones), or the login-utils ones but WITH libuser support.
