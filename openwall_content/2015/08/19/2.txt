It has been fixed:  Also the description for issue is listed in the changelog:   Wen Guanxing from Venustech ADLAB   Guanxing Wen  > PCRE is a regular expression C library inspired by the regular expression > capabilities in the Perl programming language. The PCRE library is > incorporated into a number of prominent programs, such as Adobe Flash, > Apache, Nginx, PHP. > > PCRE library is prone to a vulnerability which leads to Heap Overflow. > During the compilation of a malformed regular expression, more data is > written on the malloced block than the expected size output by > compile_regex. Exploits with advanced Heap Fengshui techniques may allow an > attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the user running the > affected application. > > Reference: > > > Could you assign a CVE-ID for this? > > Thank you && Regards. > > Wen Guanxing from Venustech ADLAB >   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
