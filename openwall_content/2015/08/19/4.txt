A request that included a specially crafted request parameter could be   used to access content that would otherwise be protected.   Mitigation: All users of Apache Flex BlazeDS prior to  Example: For an AMF message that contains the following xml payload: <?xml version="1.0"   <!DOCTYPE foo [     <!ELEMENT foo ANY >     <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]><foo>&xxe;</foo> the entity &xxe; would be expanded to the content of the file /etc/passwd. However this expanded information is not automatically transferred back to the client, but could be made available by the application.
