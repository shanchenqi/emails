"We" is the oss-security community, or the current subscribers to this mailing list.  I expect that very few people, if any, need those postings.  I want to hear from those few, if any.  If it's no one at all, then the postings should just stop.  If it's like 1 or 2 people or groups, then we should find a way for Kurt to e-mail them directly (and I don't mind setting up a separate mailing list if that would help).  If it's a lot of people (totally unexpected, but who knows), then we should continue the current practice.  So, once again, can _only_ those people who want to see non-informative CVE REJECT postings in here state so, please?  I don't need to hear from the 99%+ of people who I am sure don't want to see those postings in here.  That's obvious.  I also already know your preference, Kurt.  And let's end this thread soon.  It isn't meant to be long, or that would defeat the purpose.  But for now, the thread is open in case anyone at all (besides Kurt) has any objections to the proposed decision or wants to establish another mechanism for them to receive those seemingly useless messages.
