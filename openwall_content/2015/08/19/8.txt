Top-posting and over-quoting are discouraged.  Also discouraged are what I call thanks-only postings.  It's polite to thank the person, but unless you have something valuable to add, those postings are not worth distributing to all the list subscribers.  To make my own posting more valuable (rather than moderation-only):  > > On Wed, Aug 19, at PM, sophia <sophia@...ilofbits.com> wrote: > >> Just wondering how to get more information about the process for > >> requesting a CVE for this vulnerability.  Kurt provided that, but more importantly: you should be patient.  MITRE are often slow at assigning CVE IDs.  It's only been a week.  They often need several weeks, unfortunately.  (In contrast, Kurt is usually quick to assign CVE IDs on the distros list, but this only works for not yet public issues and is only acceptable if those issues are disclosed to the distros list primarily for the purpose of informing the distros rather than for acquiring a CVE ID.  Having a CVE ID is too unimportant to be worth the risk.)  > >> On Aug 12, at PM, sophia <sophia@...ilofbits.com> wrote: > >>> The vulnerability definitely applies to hypervisors as used by popular > >>> commercial cloud platforms.

WhyXen.pdf does mention isolation, but it doesn't mention covert channels, leaving it ambiguous (to those of us aware of the possibility of covert channels) what level of isolation is actually intended.  Maybe they need to revise the document to explicitly exclude covert channels.  Historically, access control didn't automatically imply lack of covert channels.  For example, per the Orange Book covert channels weren't even considered for the lower classes such as C1 and C2, where typical and "Trusted" multi-user systems fell.  They are only considered starting with B2 and B3, which rarely applied:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Computer_System_Evaluation_Criteria#Divisions_and_classes  Once again, to avoid misunderstanding, I only use this as a historical reference.  > >>> Also, I will release all of my code on my website when I get back to my > >>> server later today.
