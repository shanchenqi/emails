If there's no likelihood that any open-source software vendor has already used the rejected CVE in an existing advisory (or a pending one), then these posts are useless.  As the security team leader for the Mageia distribution, I always check our Bugzilla when Kurt sends these posts to see if we've used the CVE(s) in question, and I cannot recall a case where I've ever found that we had.  It would be a lot more helpful if he would state at least the software that the CVE was associated with; it drives me crazy when he does not.  If he's not able to give this information, then it's very unlikely that anyone has already used the CVE.  If he is able to give at least the software, then it *might* be helpful to someone.  So, long story short, I agree with Solar Designer.   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
