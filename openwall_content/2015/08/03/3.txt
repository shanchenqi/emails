Public release.  Updated status of the patches.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  When unplugging an emulated block device the device was not fully unplugged, meaning a second unplug attempt would attempt to unplug the device a second time using a previously freed pointer.  IMPACT ======  An HVM guest which has access to an emulated IDE disk device may be able to exploit this vulnerability in order to take over the qemu process elevating its privilege to that of the qemu process.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen systems running x86 HVM guests using the upstream based "qemu-xen" are vulnerable.  Systems using the "qemu-xen-traditional" version of the qemu device model, either in a stubdomain or as a domain 0 process, are not vulnerable.  Systems running only PV guests are NOT vulnerable.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  There is no known mitigation for this issue.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Donghai Zhu of Alibaba.  RESOLUTION ==========  The attached patches have been proposed as fixes for the issue. However they have not been finalised by upstream.  A revised advisory will be issued in the event that the final patches differ from those included here.         qemu-upstream, xen-unstable             qemu-upstream, Xen 4.5.x, Xen                                    4.4.x, Xen 4.3.x, Xen 4.2.x  $   $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
