When used in this manner,  it's possible for a 3rd party to pass a 'fileUrl' header to the Apache Tika Server (tika-server). This header lets a remote client request that the server fetches content from the URL provided, including files from the server's local filesystem. Depending on the file permissions set on the local filesystem, this could be used to return sensitive content from  the server machine.  Note this vulnerability only exists if you are running the tika-server version 1.9, and you allow un-trusted access to the tika-server URL. Usage of Apache Tika as a standard library is not affected.  Mitigation: Apache Tika 1.9 users should upgrade to Apache Tika  Example: wget && java -jar tika-server-1.9.jar curl -i -H "fileUrl:file:///etc/passwd" -H "Accept: text/plain" -X PUT  Credit: This issue was discovered by Tim Allison from the Apache Tika Community.
