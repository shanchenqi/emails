These filenames can contain escape sequences, when viewed using the ausearch programs "-i" option for example this can result in the escape sequences being processed unsafely by the terminal program being used to view the data.  This has been corrected upstream with the following commit:  Easy workaround: don't use really old terminals/rxvt/etc that are vulnerable to escape sequence handling issues.   --   -- Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
