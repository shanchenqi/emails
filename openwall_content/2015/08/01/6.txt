[Jens: fixed compile error with SCSI logging enabled]          Signed-off-by: FUJITA Tomonori <fujita.tomonori@....ntt.co.jp>     Signed-off-by: Douglas Gilbert <dougg@...que.net>     Cc: Mike Christie <michaelc@...wisc.edu>     Cc: James Bottomley <James.Bottomley@...senPartnership.com>     Signed-off-by: Jens Axboe <jens.axboe@...cle.com>  It was fixed in Linux by:  commit Author: Al Viro <viro@...iv.linux.org.uk> Date:   Sat Mar 21      sg_start_req(): make sure that there's not too many elements in iovec          unfortunately, allowing an arbitrary 16bit value means a possibility of     overflow in the calculation of total number of pages in bio_map_user_iov() -     we rely on there being no more than PAGE_SIZE members of sum in the     first loop there.  If that sum wraps around, we end up allocating     too small array of pointers to pages and it's easy to overflow it in     the second loop.          X-Coverup: TINC (and there's no lumber cartel either)     Cc: stable@...r.kernel.org # way, way back     Signed-off-by: Al Viro <viro@...iv.linux.org.uk>  commit Author: Al Viro <viro@...iv.linux.org.uk> Date:   Sat Mar 21      sg_start_req(): use import_iovec()          Signed-off-by: Al Viro <viro@...iv.linux.org.uk>  This has not been included in any stable branches yet.  When backporting the fix to older kernel versions, the second commit can't be used.  The first commit requires a naming fix-up: s/MAX_UIOVEC/UIO_MAXIOV/.
