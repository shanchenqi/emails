Cc: stable@...r.kernel.org  #     Signed-off-by: Al Viro <viro@...iv.linux.org.uk>  Thanks to Brad Spengler for pointing this out:<  The fix was also included in the following stable releases:  path_openat(): fix double fput() path_openat(): fix double fput() path_openat(): fix double fput() path_openat(): fix double fput() path_openat(): fix double fput()  Ben.  --  Ben Hutchings One of the nice things about standards is that there are so many of them.
