Gday,  A malicious user could create a special stack layout that fools the perf_callchain_user_64 function (called by perf record) into  an infinite loop, tying up that particular CPU and the process  can not be killed.  A kernel patch was committed upstream capping the maximum user-level stacktrace collected by perf to PERF_MAX_STACK_DEPTH on 64bit powerpc architectures. This affects ppc64 kernels that support perf.
