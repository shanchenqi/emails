Both patches are recommended.  As far as we can tell, the message was written this way because you are addressing multiple audiences: one audience is interested in what aspects of the commits are security-related so that they can be mapped to individual CVE IDs, and another audience is much less concerned about these mapping details but wants to fix the security problem without adding a new problem in its place. Specifically, our understanding is that there is no expectation that anyone has a production copy of the code with but not If anyone had such a copy, they possibly might find that an attacker could cause a performance degradation via a crafted client that intentionally triggers the "select() call repeated in a loop if the timeout expired without incoming data" issue. In other words, there is no CVE ID for a "repeated in a loop" problem, and probably for two reasons: nobody is using that code, and the performance degradation is too small.   >  The only CVE ID is for the presence of "addr.sin6_addr = in6addr_any" in the original code.
