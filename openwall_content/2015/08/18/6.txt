If the effective UID of the caller is root, the real UID and saved set-user-ID are also set. On success, zero is returned. On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.  Note: there are cases where setuid() can fail even when the  caller is UID 0; it is a grave security error to omit checking for a failure return from setuid(). if an environment limits  the number of processes a user can have, setuid() might fail if the target uid already is at the limit.  Can we have CVE assigned to this ?
