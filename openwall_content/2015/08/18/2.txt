A privileged local user with access to the /dev/vhost-net files.  The provided descriptor would never be released and consume kernel memory.  Usually this /dev/vhost-net file(s) have write access with root permissions but applications may access it with privileged  access through libvirt or other virtualisation.  A file descriptor may waste memory for each VHOST_SET_LOG_FD command issued, eventually wasting available system resources creating a denial of service.
