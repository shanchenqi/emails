This piqued my interest, so I went down the following rabbit hole:  This fix in FreeBSD seems to have been sourced from Bitrig, the OpenBSD fork:   A quick glance shows the first parts of the vulnerability fix changes code introduced by this commit, the actual initial import of this BSD licensed patch to FreeBSD from DragonflyBSD.    Bitrig originally patched it here:   DragonflyBSD removed this functionality entirely here:   and then Bitrig did the same:   I checked and NetBSD patched it here:   OpenBSD's patch was here:   As for GNU patch, looking in src/inp.c shows it has diverged a lot, but I couldn't say if that makes it invulnerable.
