SDM Volume 3 says:  On calls to exception and interrupt handlers, the processor also clears the VM, RF, and NT flags in the EFLAGS register, after they are saved on the stack.  So if an interrupt or page fault happened while NT was incorrectly set, the NT flag would still be clear when context switching and would therefore never leak.  (This wouldn't have been the case before when we could context switch by calling schedule() directly while NT was set, but those kernels manually saved and restored flags across context switches.)  --Andy  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
