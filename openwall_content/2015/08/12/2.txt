Past discussion of this includes:  Details of attack: http://sophia.re/RECON/  Conferences presented at: RECON Montreal - Blackhat - https://www.blackhat.com/us-15/briefings.html#exploiting-out-of-order-execution-for-covert-cross-vm-communication <https://www.blackhat.com/us-15/briefings.html#exploiting-out-of-order-execution-for-covert-cross-vm-communication>  Previously requested: no Type: Side Channel Vulnerability  Affected versions: up till current processor architecture   Brief Description:  Simultaneous multi-threading on current processors allows for one process to exploit out-of-order execution optimizations to leak information from co-executed processes. Conversely, this same setup allows for one process to force an increase or a decrease in out-of-order-execution optimizations in the other process, thereby effecting its computed values and control flow.   - Sophia D'Antoine Content of type "text/html" skipped  Download attachment "smime.p7s" of type "application/pkcs7-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
