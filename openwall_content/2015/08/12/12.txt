Blimey, but this thread takes me back to the when we used to send  ASCII bombs around on the Amateur ("Ham") packet radio network.  Send a sequence to program a function key (such as F1) with "FORMAT C: /Y"  (or whatever the syntax was).  For belt'n'braces, include the sequence that hit F1...  Remember when DOS was not a mere denial of service?  Well, some could  argue that it was, even back then...  --  Dave Horsfall DTM (VK2KFU)  "Those who don't understand security will suffer" RIP Cecil the Lion; he was in pain for two days, thanks to some brave hunter.
