Some documents use to refer to a vulnerability in BIND. Apparently, they source back to   which says:  â Debian Security Update AlienVault ID: Description: name.c in named in ISC BIND 9.7.x through 9.9.x before and before when configured as a recursive resolver with DNSSEC validation, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (REQUIRE assertion failure and daemon exit) by constructing crafted zone data and then making a query for a name in that zone. CVE ID: CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.8 CVSS v2 Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:N) â  That description seems to match so I'm leaning towards typo:   I don't know how this came into being.  Debian does not appear responsible, the immutable list archives use the correct ID:   Comments appreciated.  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
