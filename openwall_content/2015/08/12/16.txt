Are systems with "keyboard interactive" and "challenge-response" authentication disabled (all of PAMAuthenticationViaKbdInt, KbdInteractiveAuthentication, and ChallengeResponseAuthentication, as applicable to a given sshd version, set to no) affected by these issues as well?  The code appears to be specific to this mode, but it isn't immediately clear whether or not these configuration settings prevent the vulnerable code from being reached in the privsep monitor even when the privsep child is compromised.  If the settings do not currently prevent the code from being reached (I hope they do), then this should be corrected as a hardening measure.  And this is another reminder to all of us that enabling "keyboard interactive" or "challenge-response" authentication in sshd is extra risk, and it shouldn't be done unless necessary on a given system.  Upstream sshd_config man page lists ChallengeResponseAuthentication as enabled by default, whereas Debian/Ubuntu (at least some versions) have it set to no in their default /etc/ssh/sshd_config (and enable UsePAM instead).
