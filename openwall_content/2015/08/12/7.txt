It is not listed in ISC's collection of BIND security advisories:    and I can say definitely that it is not a number which we are planning to use for a pending advisory (i.e. the "leak" scenario can be dismissed.)  The number appears to have been reserved for use by another party who has not yet provided MITRE with any details, as their page still shows the place-holder typical of an assigned number which has not yet been updated with details after public disclosure:      A typo is the most likely explanation (and I can tell you from experience that it is very easy to err when writing communications which refer to things labeled with the CVE number format.)
