I was reviewing the code and fuzzing various terminal emulators quite extensively some time ago, and found that "only" rxvt might be susceptible to this (if I remember correctly, there's typo in the code that enables this).  $ echo -ne "\eGQ;" ;$ 0 bash: 0: command not found  If you manage to append some arbitrary bytes to the input queue (except 0 and meaningless sequences like echo -ne "\e[6n\eGQ;"), then this sequence can be used to execute your command.  As for other terminal emulators, I was able to crash most of them, and from what I see I still have testcases for konsole, pterm, rxvt, securecrt and xterm. I was looking for command injections though, so simply forgot to submit the testcases to the maintainers of the code after the exercise. I'll do that shortly.  --  Robert Święcki   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
