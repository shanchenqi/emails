Also reported by Moritz Jodeit. > > [1] http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-7.0 > > Thank you, > Moritz Could you assign CVEs for the other two issues as well?    * sshd(8): fix circumvention of MaxAuthTries using keyboard-     interactive authentication. By specifying a long, repeating     keyboard-interactive "devices" string, an attacker could request     the same authentication method be tried thousands of times in     a single pass. The LoginGraceTime timeout in sshd(8) and any     authentication failure delays implemented by the authentication     mechanism itself were still applied. Found by Kingcope.    * sshd(8): OpenSSH 6.8 and 6.9 incorrectly set TTYs to be world-     writable. Local attackers may be able to write arbitrary messages     to logged-in users, including terminal escape sequences.     Reported by Nikolay Edigaryev.  Or have they CVEs already?
