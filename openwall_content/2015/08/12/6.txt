Can we get CVE's assigned?   * Internal review discovered that Special:DeletedContributions did not properly protect the IP of autoblocked users. This fix makes the functionality of Special:DeletedContributions consistent with Special:Contributions and Special:BlockList.  * Internal review discovered that watchlist anti-csrf tokens were not being compared in constant time, which could allow various timing attacks. This could allow an attacker to modify a user's watchlist via csrf.  * John Menerick reported that MediaWiki's thumb.php failed to sanitize various error messages, resulting in xss.  * Extension:SemanticForms - MediaWiki user Grunny discovered multiple reflected xss vectors in SemanticForms. Further internal review discovered and fixed other reflected and stored xss vectors.  * Extension:SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi - xss and potential DoS vectors. Internal review discovered that the contib directory for GeSHi was re-included in MediaWiki Some scripts could be potentially be used for DoS, and DAU Huy Ngoc discovered an xss vector. All contrib scripts have been removed.  * Extension:TimedMediaHandler - User:McZusatz reported that resetting transcodes deleted the transcode without creating a new one, which could be used for vandalism or potentially DoS.  * Extension:Quiz - Internal review discovered that Quiz did not properly escape regex metacharacters in a user controlled regular expression, enabling a DoS vector.  * Extension:Widgets - MediaWiki developer Majr reported a potential HTML injection (xss) vector.
