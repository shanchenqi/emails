During a normal pre-authentication phase, some code runs with this uid, and other code runs as root. The phrase "pre-authentication process" is potentially ambiguous, i.e., it could mean either "the sequence of steps that occur during the pre-authentication phase" or "the UNIX process that is intentionally running with the sshd uid."  We don't understand why "for remote code execution" was mentioned. A case where a local attacker, who has access only to the sshd uid, can exploit a bug in the monitor component seems completely relevant for purposes of CVE.  In other words, we think the CVE IDs below apply to two types of threat models: either there is a security-relevant bug in the code that runs with the sshd uid, or the attacker happens to have access to the sshd uid for a reason unrelated to the OpenSSH source code (e.g., administrative error). In the former case, there would be a separate CVE ID for any such bug.   >>  * sshd(8): Portable OpenSSH only: Fixed a privilege separation >>    weakness related to PAM support.
