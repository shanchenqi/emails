Hello List, I am requesting a CVE to be issued for the SuiteCRM product. There exists a race condition in the image upload verification component which leads to a race condition wherein an uploaded piece of PHP code exists on disc temporarily before being deleted, which can be leveraged to gain code execution. This vulnerability was introduced in version as a patch to fix a prior code execution issue found in  Github issue: Responsible commit: Them being told it was a bad idea: Video of exploitation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHVIg5eoYNc  A proof of concept exploit will be published in a couple of days along with a dissection of the vulnerable components of the code and explanation of how it all works and stuff.
