Both tvp and tvp->buf are freed by jas_tvparser_destroy(tvp) (line but if one of the two following branch conditions is taken (line a second call to jas_tvparser_destroy(tvp) occurs (line It is a use-after-free because before calling free in jas_tvparser_destroy there is a check to tvp->buf, while tvp could have been freed. Two double free take place just after this check (on tvp->buf and tvp). A simple fix  should be to move the first call of jas_tvparser_destroy after the two branch conditions (or set tvp to NULL after it has been freed in mif_process_cmpt).  The vulnerability was found by a static binary analysis using the tool gueb (that will become open-source soon).  Since another double-free in this library was found recently maybe a patch could fix both of them ?
