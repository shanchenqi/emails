A few interesting test cases are available here:  https://zimbra.imag.fr/home/gustavo.grieco@imag.fr/Briefcase/Public/cases.tar.gz  They are compressed to avoid easily crash programs like Nautilus and Firefox. All them can be verified using:  jasper --input $filename --output-format pnm  (tested in Ubuntu 32-bit but it should work in other configurations)  Additionally. sigsegv.jp2 crashes most of the programs using gdk-pixbuf like Firefox and Chrome (!). I report them this issue a few days ago and advise them to disable preview of jpeg images since Jasper is unmaintained and vulnerable. Mozilla developers are working hard trying to find a workaround to avoid use vulnerable code. On the other hand, Chromium developers dismissed this issue saying that they will wait the "upstream fix".  I think the cause of such memory corruptions is uninitialized values, taken from the heap, as valgrind reports:   Memcheck, a memory error detector Copyright (C) and GNU GPL'd, by Julian Seward et al.
