The first three issues require authentication.  Considering the low impact and the availability of upstream fixes for most of the issues, we'd like to make the issues public as soon as possible, unless there are any objections.  (Impact may be higher if ntpd runs with root privileges.)  *  It was found that ntpd could crash due to an uninitialized variable when processing malformed logconfig configuration commands, for example:  ntpq -c ":config logconfig a"  Upstream fix:   *  It was found that ntpd exits with a segmentation fault when a statistics type that was not enabled during compilation (e.g. timingstats) is referenced by the statistics or filegen configuration command, for example:  ntpq -c ':config statistics timingstats' ntpq -c ':config filegen timingstats'  Upstream fix:   *  It was found that the :config command can be used to set the pidfile and driftfile paths without any restrictions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to overwrite a file on the file system with a file containing the pid of the ntpd process (immediately) or the current estimated drift of the system clock (in hourly intervals). For example:  ntpq -c ':config pidfile /tmp/ntp.pid' ntpq -c ':config driftfile /tmp/ntp.drift'  No upstream fix, but Miroslav wrote the attached patch.  *  It was discovered that sntp would hang in an infinite loop when a crafted NTP packet was received, related to the conversion of the precision value in the packet to double.  Upstream fix:    (Reported to the distros list and upstream last week, no request for an embargo, hence public disclosure.)  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security   View attachment "ntp-remotewrite.patch" of type "text/x-patch" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
