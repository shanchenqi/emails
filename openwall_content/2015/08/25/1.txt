A malicious 32-bit program might be able to leak NT into an unrelated task.  On a CONFIG_PREEMPT=y kernel, this is a straightforward DoS.  On a CONFIG_PREEMPT=n kernel, it's probably still exploitable for DoS with some more care.  I believe that this could be used for privilege escalation, too, but it won't be easy.  The fix is just to revert the optimization:   Mitigation: CONFIG_IA32_EMULATION=n.  Seccomp does *not* mitigate this bug.  --Andy  P.S. This is yet another x86 mis-design leading to garbage results.
