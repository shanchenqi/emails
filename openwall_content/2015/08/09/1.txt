Here is the github  repository: https://github.com/claviska/simple-php-captcha.  We opened an issue on github  <https://github.com/claviska/simple-php-captcha/issues/16>, and the  vulnerability has been fixed. They never did any release so we don't  think the fix will be released in any form. Simply advising users to  update to git master's should suffice.  The simple-php-captcha.php file had a vulnerability enabling a client to  generate the captcha response automatically, effectively bypassing the  captcha.  Since the microtime() function was used both in the initial seed for the  captcha and in the captcha url path sent to the client, it was possible  to generate the captcha result automatically by running the same code  client-side.  Could a CVE be assigned to this?  Thank you, François   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
