Find attached a single test case that exposes both vulnerabilities. They can be easily detected using valgrind:   $ valgrind bsdtar -tvf oob-access.tar  bsdtar: Failed to set default locale Invalid read of size 4    at archive_read_format_tar_read_header    by _archive_read_next_header2    by _archive_read_next_header    by read_archive    by tar_mode_t (read.c:86)    by main  Address is 4 bytes before a block of size 32 alloc'd    at malloc (in /usr/lib/valgrind/vgpreload_memcheck-x86-linux.so)    by realloc (in /usr/lib/valgrind/vgpreload_memcheck-x86-linux.so)    by archive_string_ensure    by archive_wstring_append_from_mbs    by archive_mstring_get_wcs    by archive_entry_pathname_w    by tar_read_header    by archive_read_format_tar_read_header    by _archive_read_next_header2    by _archive_read_next_header    by read_archive    by tar_mode_t (read.c:86) ---------x  0 1      1           1 Jan  1   $ valgrind tar -tvf oob-access.tar  tar: Substituting `.' for empty member name Invalid read of size 1    at simple_print_header    by list_archive    by read_and    by main  Address is 1 bytes before a block of size 1 alloc'd    at malloc (in /usr/lib/valgrind/vgpreload_memcheck-x86-linux.so)    by xmalloc (xmalloc.c:43)    by xmemdup    by xstrdup    by assign_string (misc.c:43)    by read_header    by read_and    by main ---------x 1/1               1   Fortunately the last revisions of GNU Tar and libarchive fixed these issues. Do we have CVE for these issues?  Regards, Gustavo.
