The goal of VuFind is to enable your users to search and browse through all of your library's resources by replacing the traditional OPAC to include: Catalog Records, Locally Cached Journals, Digital Library Items, Institutional Repository, Institutional Bibliography, Other Library Collections and Resources. VuFind is completely modular so you can implement just the basic system, or all of the components. And since it's open source, you can modify the modules to best fit your need or you can add new modules to extend your resource offerings. VuFind runs on Solr Energy. Apache Solr, an open source search engine, offers amazing performance and scalability to allow for VuFind to respond to search queries in milliseconds time. It has the ability to be distributed if you need to spread the load of the catalog over many servers or in a server farm environment. VuFind is offered for free through the GPL open source license. This means that you can use the software for free. You can modify the software and share your successes with the community! Take a look at our VuFind Installations Wiki page to see how a variety of organizations have taken advantage of VuFind's flexibility. If you are already using VuFind, feel free to edit the page and share your accomplishments. "       *(2) Vulnerability Details:* VuFind web application has a computer security problem. Hackers can exploit it by reflected XSS cyber attacks. This may allow a remote attacker to create a specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser session within the trust relationship between their browser and the server.  Several other similar products 0-day vulnerabilities have been found by some other bug researchers before. VuFind has patched some of them. "scip AG was founded in We are driven by innovation, sustainability, transparency, and enjoyment of our work. We are completely self-funded and are thus in the comfortable position to provide completely independent and neutral services. Our staff consists of highly specialized experts who focus on the topic information security and continuously further their expertise through advanced training".   *(2.1)* The code flaw occurs at "lookfor?" parameter in "/vufind/Resource/Results?" page.  Some other researcher has reported a similar vulnerability here and VuFind has patched it.        *(3) Solution:* Update to new version.          *References:* http://tetraph.com/security/xss-vulnerability/vufind-xss/        -- Jing Wang, Division of Mathematical Sciences (MAS), School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences (SPMS), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. http://www.tetraph.com/wangjing/ https://twitter.com/justqdjing   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
