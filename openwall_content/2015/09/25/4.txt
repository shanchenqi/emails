The short answer is that has two CVE IDs, and has one CVE ID; see below.  The message was apparently posted after but didn't mention that existed. The MITRE CVE team had begun work on CVE entries for but then that oss-security message was noticed.   > > > >  All of corresponds to which has existed for about 10 days:      > > > >  refers to four files in which return values aren't checked, and uninitialized memory can consequently be accessed. Use for all of those issues.  Also within t42parse.c has a new code block with a comment of "we would get an infinite loop if we don't do anything here." As far as we can tell, this is a fix for a ("Incomplete Internal State Distinction") issue in the sense that the possibility of immediates-only mode isn't checked. This is not closely related to the cause of the t1load.c infinite loop. Use for this t42parse.c vulnerability.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  BEqAdTwSgKwtENbFQm9A =b8NX -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
