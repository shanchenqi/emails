STEPS TO REPRODUCE:      1. Put an image in a folder called "$(xeyes)"      2. Open the image in Shutter      3. Right-click the image and click "Show in Folder"  The `xeyes` program (if installed on your system) should start.  Lines  54+ of share/shutter/resources/modules/Shutter/App/HelperFunctions.pm:         sub xdg_open {         	my ( $self, $dialog, $link, $user_data ) = @_;         	system("xdg-open $link"); 	}  Because `system` is used, the string is scanned for shell metacharacters[1], and if found the string is executed using a shell.
