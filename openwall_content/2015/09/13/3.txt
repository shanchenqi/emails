STEPS TO REPRODUCE:      1. Add "https://github.com/lfaraone/turbulent-octo-garbanzo" as a         project in svn-workbench      2. Checkout the project      3. Navigate to "trunk/$(xeyes)"      4. Click "Actions", then "Command Shell"  The `xeyes` program (if installed on your system) should start.  Source/wb_shell_unix_commands.py starting at line 53:         def ShellOpen( app, project_info, filename ):             app.log.info( T_('Open %s') % filename )             cur_dir = os.getcwd()             try:          wb_platform_specific.uChdir( project_info.getWorkingDir() )                 os.system( "xdg-open '%s'" % filename )             finally:                 wb_platform_specific.uChdir( cur_dir )  The code should instead start a subprocess in a secure way, such as using subprocess.call().  has been assigned for this issue.   This issue affects at least version (older versions may be affected) through the current latest version of svn-workbench at time of writing.
