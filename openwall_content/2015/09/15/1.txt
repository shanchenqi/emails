The advisory linked above only mentions it was fixed in but the changelog for that version does not mention the CVE, or any change that looks like XSS for that matter.  https://github.com/DataTables/DataTables/commits/master  Thanks!  --  Martin PrpiÄ / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
