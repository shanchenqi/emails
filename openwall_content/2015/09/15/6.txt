In concrete, they said:  "My initial (quick) analysis suggested that the basic problem is corrupt (unrealistic) Extra-Field sizes, which UnZip does not check well enough. I need to verify that that is the cause, and then figure out what to do about it. Currently, if the program sees an Extra-Field length of, say, it tends to believe it, even if that's bigger than the actual archive member's length (or perhaps even bigger than the whole archive). If it actually tries to read data which haven't been read, then valgrind gets upset (with good reason). At least that's what I believe so far."    > -- > Stefan Cornelius / Red Hat Product Security >   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
