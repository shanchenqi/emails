A checkbox exists to hide the values of parameters stored in the application to mask them from casual viewing.  When changing the hide/show checkbox, the value is masked/unmasked in the UI, but the parameter value was not properly escaped when updating the UI which allowed stored HTML/JS etc. to be evaluated.  Affects: Foreman or higher Fix to be released in Foreman  Patch:  More information: http://theforeman.org/  - --  Dominic Cleal dominic@...al.org -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v2  =V/Ke -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
