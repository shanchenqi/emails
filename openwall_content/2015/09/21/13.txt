The issues would have been caught by the ARM port of UDEREF in non-exploit usage. I'd guess that a port of UDEREF to an Android kernel would uncover more of these.  It's sad that Samsung never addressed this. I guess they might now that there's a CVE, as vendors generally only backport security fixes when it becomes an image problem.
