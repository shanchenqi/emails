I was about to post the number here, but as the internal ticket IDs do not match as I expected, I refrain from doing so in order to avoid confusion.  I am not sure if Zarafa contacts are on this list, but I will forward this mail so that they can confirm/clarify publicly.  So, for now, I don't think a new CVE should be assigned. Either Zarafa or me will send an update shortly.  Kind regards,  Christian   On PM, Martin Prpic wrote: > Hi, >  > The following bug was reported to Red Hat: >  > >  > The issue is noted as "zarafa-autorespond suffers from a potential local > privilege escalation" in the zarafa changelog: >  > >  > Patch: >  > >  > Can a CVE be assigned for this issue? >  > Thanks! >     Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
