This was tested in Ubuntu (64bit) but the issue exists even in the CVS libtiff version. Please find attached the compressed test case (otherwise it can kill my browser since gdk-pixbuf is loading tiff files in the preview dialog!). You can test it executing:  $ tiffdither oom.tif /dev/null  If you run it with ltrace, you can see some very large reallocs:  libtiff.so.5->realloc(0,              = libtiff.so.5->realloc(0,              =  Upstream was notified but there is still no fix.
