So I'm wrong about this part, as pipacs pointed out the __user marking is missing here, so it won't memset it in this case.  The missing __user would be found by upstream's sparse tool or the PaX checker plugin though.  The STRUCTLEAK plugin could also be extended to zero based on the copy_*_user calls, but that's probably not very useful since the missing __user markings could just be found via the existing tooling and fixed.
