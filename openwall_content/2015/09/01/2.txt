Here are three recent finds that kcwu reported after apparently testing GNU screen with afl-fuzz:   While I suspect that command injection bugs (the thing that started the thread) are fairly rare, I fully expect that escape sequence handling is under-audited and that there's plenty of mem corruption bugs to be found.
