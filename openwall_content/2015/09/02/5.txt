A bug was recently found in our DNS packet parsing/generation code, which, when exploited, can cause individual threads (disabling service) or whole processes (allowing a supervisor to restart them) to crash with just one or a few query packets.  * CVE: * Date: 2nd of September * Credit: Pyry Hakulinen and Ashish Shakla at Automattic * Affects: PowerDNS Authoritative Server through * Not affected: PowerDNS Authoritative Server * Severity: High * Impact: Degraded service or Denial of service * Exploit: This problem can be triggered by sending specially crafted   query packets * Risk of system compromise: No * Solution: Upgrade to a non-affected version * Workaround: Run the Authoritative Server inside a supervisor when   `distributor-threads`  is set to `1` to prevent Denial of Service.   No workaround for the degraded service exists  PowerDNS Authoritative Server are affected. No other versions are affected. The PowerDNS Recursor is not affected.  PowerDNS Authoritative Server contains a fix to this issue. A minimal patch is available [1].  This issue is entirely unrelated to Security Advisory  We'd like to thank Pyry Hakulinen and Ashish Shakla at Automattic for finding and subsequently reporting this bug.  1 -  --  Pieter Lexis PowerDNS.COM BV - https://www.powerdns.com   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
