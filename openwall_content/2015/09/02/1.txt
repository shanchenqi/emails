Long story short I assigned the following CVE's to OpenAFS:  OpenAFS: vos leaks stack data onto the wire in the clear when creating vldb entries OpenAFS: bos commands can be spoofed, including some which alter server state OpenAFS: pioctls leak kernel memory OpenAFS: kernel pioctl support for OSD command passing can trigger a panic OpenAFS: Solaris grouplist modifications for PAGs can panic or overwrite memory  however they also used for  I definitely did NOT assign to OpenAFS, I double checked my email to them and the commits to our file that we use to handle CVE assignments.  I did in fact assign to Samba (for a still embargoed issue). I was notified of this duplicate issue by Samba (basically asking me what was going on).  Mitre: can you please REJECT and assign a NEW CVE for the OpenAFS issue. I have assigned Samba a new CVE for their embargoed issue already. Thanks.  -- Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
