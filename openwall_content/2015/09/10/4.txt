I know this is a bug but I don't have time to fix it or test your patch. I am afraid your patch may introduce another problem because you don't handle vm_prfile. I still think get/put(vm_prfile) is necessary. Its lifetime should be equivalent to vm_file's essentially. How about the test case for the race condition between these? - groupA: msync or madvise - groupB: mmap and munmap  As you might know, aufs mmap/munmap handle vm_file and vm_prfile. When aufs munmap calls fput(vm_prfile) and your patch doesn't fget(vm_prfile), then vm_prfile will be broken. And I am afraid it will cause a problem like use-after-free.  I have no objection to assign a CVE ID, but I don't think it is fixed or at least I didn't confirmt yet.   J. R.
