Can CVE be assigned as appropriate please?  Vulnerable versions are to (inclusive), which are built with OpenSSL and configured for "SSL-Bump" decryption.   Integer overflows can lead to invalid pointer math reading from random memory on some CPU architectures. In the best case this leads to wrong TLS extensiosn being used for the client, worst-case a crash of the proxy terminating all active transactions. Fixed by atch>.  Incorrect message size checks and assumptions about the existence of TLS extensions in the SSL/TLS handshake message can lead to very high CPU consumption (up to and including 'infinite loop' behaviour). Fixed by atch>.   The above can be triggered remotely. Though there is one layer of authorization applied before this processing to check that the client is allowed to use the proxy, that check is generally weak. MS Skype on Windows XP is known to trigger some of these.  (Formal release with advisory will be coming in a few days. tarballs are available now, via FTP if the web mirrors ).
