It could occur while receiving large packets over  the tuntap/macvtap interfaces and when guest's virtio-net driver did not  support big/mergeable receive buffers.  An attacker on the local network could use this flaw to disable guest's networking by sending a large number of jumbo frames to the guest, exhausting all receive buffers and thus leading to a DoS situation.  Upstream fixes: ---------------    ->    ->    ->  [PATCH 3/3] above fixes this issue by discarding the used descriptors.
