Yes, that is correct. I should have rephrased that better, thanks for   clearing that up.  >> It's no secret, most of us rely on 'cat' to view files.

There are several ways one can go about this, but the   point is, do people actually do that? Do they take that extra care   sometimes? :)  I'd also like to point out that the title should've been   "s/party/hack/ like it's I guess that's what you get when   you're trying to write up things fast, but that's not really the point   of the post ;-)    Quoting "Cliff Perry" <cperry@...hat.com>:  >> Interesting.

I believe some adjustments to the script would make it not jump a line   for other terminal emulators.   ---------------------------------------------------------------- This message was sent using IMP, the Internet Messaging Program.
