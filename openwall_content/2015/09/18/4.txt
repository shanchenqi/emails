This issue was reported at https://github.com/vesse/node-ldapauth-fork/issues/21 and was fixed in . ldapauth-fork version includes the fix.  Can a CVE be assigned for this issue?  Note: the node-ldapauth project found at https://github.com/trentm/node-ldapauth, which node-ldapauth-fork was forked from, is still vulnerable to this issue. I notified the owner of the node-ldapauth repository but have no heard back.  --  David Black / Security Engineer.
