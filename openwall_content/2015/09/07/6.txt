Due to the way ELF dynamic linking works, if the main program was linke dagainst an older version of nss, then too little space for the SSL_ImplementedCiphers variable is allocated, and its contents is truncated.  As a result, applications using the SSL_ImplementedCiphers variables may not enable the intended set of a TLS cipher suites. â  Internally at Red Hat, we were not sure if this qualifies for a CVE. (If so, it would likely be specific to Red Hat Enterprise Linux, because upstream does not make such ABI guarantees as far as I know.)  To clarify, what happens is that: I compile application A on RHEL 7.0 against the original nss version.  Then I upgrade to RHEL 7.1 (plus security updates), and the intention is that nss will select a different, larger set of cipher suites.  However, the SSL_ImplementedCiphers variable has been truncated, so this selection process does not happen in the intended manner.  The Mozilla bug     contains some ideas how to deal with this issue.  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
