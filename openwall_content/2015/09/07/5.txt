Please assign CVEs.   After Free Vulnerability in unserialize()  		Given attacker input to unserialize() we should consider this a security issue.  after free vulnerability in session deserializer 		Same.  serialize_function_call() type confusion / RCE 		Definitely, even the summary has enough indication for me.  another use-after-free vulnerability in unserialize() with SplObjectStorage 		I would also say this can be attacker driven, so needs a CVE.  another use-after-free vulnerability in unserialize() with SplDoublyLinkedL 		Same. 	 pointer dereference 		Denial of service, these queries might be fed from remote.  Perhaps CVEs also for: over-read in exif_read_data with TIFF IFD tag byte value of 32 bytes  	Questionable. It seems no crash was observed, so no denial of service. At most a information leak.  	HAVAL gives wrong hashes in specific cases  	Questionable. I am not sure this is attacker driveable or if an attacker could do anything with this.    	Various PCRE issues caused by the regexp string. There has been a tendency to either declare this CVE worthy or 	declare that its not attacker driven usually.
