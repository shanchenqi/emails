This is not possible. Ttys are not terminals and do not deal in text. They are bidirectional byte-granularity IO devices. (Yes there's canonical mode which has some text interpretation but that's only at the endpoints and not always in use; it's not part of the actual data channel.)  > (but, let's not overreact; it's always been possible to blat out > sequences beginning with [ and hope that they'll be inserted right > after someone else's ESC.)  Well that's not going to happen if none of the writers are writing non-printable characters (ESC is non-printable). What's unique about the UTF-8 interleaving is that you can interleave _printable_ characters and get a control character.  But in general I agree that we should not be over-reacting. I think the simple, clean, non-invasive solution that won't break any real-world apps is just deprecating C1 controls once and for all -- set them off by default in existing terminals that used to have them on by default, and don't implement them at all in new terminals.
