It may be reasonable to assign one CVE ID for the Email::Address issue; however, the decision may depend somewhat on this information about normal usage. See below for a question about the behavior of the patched version.  > Because input string for Email::Address module comes from external > source (e.g. from email sent by attacker) it is security problem all > software application which parse email messages by Email::Address perl > module. For example: RT: Request Tracker, CiderWebmail, ...  The documentation says it "locates email addresses in strings" and this might not always mean "from external source." Thus, one might argue that it is not a vulnerability in a general-purpose utility such as Email::Address, and instead is a vulnerability in each individual application that uses Email::Address without changing the $Email::Address::COMMENT_NEST_LEVEL package variable to satisfy that application's threat model.  However, we think one CVE ID may be enough if, realistically, no application ever needed $COMMENT_NEST_LEVEL to have a value of 2, i.e., changing from 2 to 1 does not break anything.  We think there may be two distinct cases of nested comments:    A. each nested comment is either entirely before or entirely after      the address    B. the nested comment is inside the address, similar to the      "Wilt . (the  Stilt) Chamberlain@....US" example from      RFC section A.1.4   In case A, if $COMMENT_NEST_LEVEL is reduced, is correctness affected? Or does the module always still find the correct address string (and typically faster)?  We would guess that correctness is affected in case B.  As far as we know, case A sometimes occurs in real life. The example we found is online.microsoft.com address strings, e.g., do a web search for either of these:    jsmit@...ine.microsoft.com (Jan Smith (MSFT))   evanba@...ine.microsoft.com (Evan T. Basalik (MSFT))  As far as we know, case B essentially never occurs in the standard format of an address string, although it might occur in something like:    Wilt . (hide address from spambot(s)) Chamberlain@....US  All of the above discussion implies that the CVE ID would be assigned for the concept of "the default configuration is unsafe." This is, for most purposes, largely equivalent to the concept of "the computational complexity of the comment-parsing algorithm is too high."  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =Iv35 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
