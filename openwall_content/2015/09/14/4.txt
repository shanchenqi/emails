We have not seen any further discussion of this. Our understanding is that this "might be able to leak NT into an unrelated task" security impact was not found to affect any version of the Linux kernel. Unless there is other information, we will move into the "rejected" state later this week.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  PvwowWLecM0VCnO6nqoT =N5KU -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
