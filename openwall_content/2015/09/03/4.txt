Maybe the user should be using "cat -v" on untrusted files.  For example, suppose that the specific terminal-like program had this potentially unwanted behavior:      The font size is changed to something extremely small. The only     way for the user to recover is to type (not paste) a complex     fontsize-increase command code, and there is no way for the user     to see what they are typing.  This might be considered a denial of service by the attacker who constructs the untrusted file; however, we think it isn't necessarily a vulnerability. The vendor might believe that this behavior is a bug (or, conceivably, believe that it isn't a bug), without believing that it violates any security expectations. There might be a hierarchy of impacts, e.g.,   -- executes arbitrary shell commands contained in the untrusted file     (maybe everyone feels that this violates security expectations)   -- stack overflow (probably almost everyone feels that this violates     security expectations)   -- enables command logging to a mode file, and in doing that can     overwrite an existing log file (maybe most people feel that this     violates security expectations)   -- enables command logging to a mode file, and in doing that     cannot overwrite a file (probably some people feel that this     violates security expectations)   -- changes the font size, leading to an inconvenience for the victim     (possibly few people feel that this violates security     expectations)  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =kMUn -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
