[Yes, that's often how logs are running over the screen in videos when talking about IT-security]. It's convenient and I'm using screen exactly to avoid any injection of commands via TIOCSTI into my current TTY when a context switch is needed before starting tail, e.g. when working with LXC containers.  Still not sure, if this is an argument for CVE inclusion, at least it is one for more auditing/hardening on tools like screen, which is now happening. Thanks for that!  > [..snip..]  Download attachment "smime.p7s" of type "application/pkcs7-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
