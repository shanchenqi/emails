"tail -f" on a log file is indeed very common, but it is bad practice (akin to other very common bad practices like a sysadmin going into a user's homedir as root).  A safer alternative in terms of terminal escapes is the "F" keypress in "less -nU" (or in "less -nUEX" to more closely resemble "tail -f").  Unfortunately, I am not aware of a command-line option that would do this (that is, assume that "F" was pressed right away) - perhaps one should be added, if it's not already in there.  Unfortunately, less is more complicated and has greater attack surface than tail.  Maybe this can be partially mitigated by using the C locale with it (no UTF-8), but I did not look into that.
