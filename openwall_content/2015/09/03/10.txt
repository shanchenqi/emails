But anyway, we can confirm it's exploitable over the network.  Nice analysis, I would not have immediately seen that if I only had Hanno's reproducer.  For validating recursors, it's actually quite a bit worse than because does not require a completely crafted query, just an attacker-controlled QNAME (which can be in the in-addr.arpa or ip6.arpa tree) is sufficient.  So attacks could be reflected through basically anything.  > + is a denial-of-service vector which can be used >   against a BIND server that is performing recursion and (under >   limited conditions) an authoritative-only nameserver. >   Versions of BIND since and are vulnerable. >    This can't be reflected as easily, only through applications that use the affected record type.  --  Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
