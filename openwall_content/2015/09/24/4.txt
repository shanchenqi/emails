Details =======  A security flaw was discovered in Pulp's consumer management system. When the pulp-consumer CLI is used to register to the Pulp server, it downloads a public key from the Pulp server and stores it locally. Later when the Pulp server sends messages to the client via a message broker to instruct it to perform commands, it will use the corresponding private key to sign the messages. The client checks the signatures before executing the instructions to ensure that the messages came from the Pulp server and not from an attacker.  Versions of pulp-consumer-client between and do not check the server's TLS certificate signatures when retrieving the server's public key upon registration:   This allows a man in the middle to inject their own message signing key and to then perform administrative actions on the machine, if they are able to send messages through the message broker.  Austin Macdonald fixed this issue in this commit by using our pulp.bindings library as the rest of our CLI does:   Users who do not use pulp-consumer are not affected by this issue.  Thanks to Austin Macdonald for writing the fix, to Dennis Kliban for making our beta and release builds, and to Preethi Thomas for testing our releases!
