Sending the same CVE request to multiple addresses is typically not what MITRE wants, although you're certainly welcome to change your mind and decide that you had actually preferred that a CVE request be publicly archived from the beginning. (It's rare for a vendor to use oss-security for CVE requests related to "critical" vulnerabilities that don't yet have a fixed release. The issue descriptions here, in combination with vendor confirmation, probably make the vulnerabilities sufficiently public that they are within the scope of the oss-security list charter. We think the implication is that readers should look at    https://code.google.com/p/google-security-research/issues/list?can=1  at a future time, if interested in other details.)  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =FyM2 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
