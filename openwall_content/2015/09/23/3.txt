I got some interesting response from upstream:  "FYI, the file has a # of image lines around four billion.  I didn't dig into it closely when first reported, but it might be that auto-strip-chopping is creating an expensive/large data structure.  I'm not entirely confident whether to treat library requests for large amounts of memory as a defect in the library.  It makes me sad that modern operating systems seem to have trouble just return NULL for malloc() calls for which there isn't enough memory available.  (If my assumptions are correct)."
