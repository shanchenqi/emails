Not a single one of those programs does anything to its input that ought to be considered any form of interpretation in the sense you imply.  They simply produce outputs that correspond to their inputs. If that output is later presented to a terminal emulator, *then* some characters happen to produce effects that go beyond simply displaying them as glyphs on a screen, one by one.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with `head`, `tail`, `more`, `curl`, `wget` or `diff`.  They are not meant to “interpret” anything of the sort that is being addressed, and indeed they do not.  `less` *does* have special processing rules active by default for input sequences that would cause terminals to do anything special; indeed, the default behaviour of `less`, without the `-r` option, is the only mentioned behaviour that may be considered a form of interpretation.  > It's no secret, most of us rely on 'cat' to view files.
