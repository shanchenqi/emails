This message is directly related to a discussion of CVE assignment here on but doesn't mention that that discussion had occurred. Specifically:       From: cve-assign@...re.org    devise-two-factor can potentially have a CVE ID. As you mentioned, the   attack surface is somewhat narrow, and it might make more sense to see   how the devise-two-factor vendor announces the update. For example, if   the vendor makes a code change to prevent multiple submissions and   describes the code change as resolving a vulnerability, then there can   be a CVE ID.  The vendor did all of that, so we're assigning  [ relevant parts include 'to protect against "shoulder-surfing" attacks' in https://github.com/tinfoil/devise-two-factor/blob/master/UPGRADING.md and 'While a valid security issue, this is a very narrow vulnerability' in ]  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =aeha -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
