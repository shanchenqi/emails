There are however economic and social forces at work, e.g. at Red Hat we do our best to play nice with other vendors and reporters, why? So they keep working with us and reporting stuff to us.  SuSE is a great example, there is a piece of software that both SuSE and Red Hat ship called "SpaceWalk", SuSE handles quite a lot of the dev work (thanks!), so for example when a security vuln for Spacewalk comes in we (Red Hat) notify SuSE pretty much immediately, and they also get access to the Bugzilla entry (so I don't have to play email games, they can just look at the info directly). So for both SuSE and Red Hat this relationship with respect to SpaceWalk is hugely beneficial to both of us (in economic terms a net gain).  Companies that play less nice with reporters/other companies tend to be excluded from information sharing, while not a strict rule, it is pretty fundamental to human nature (who wants to play with mean people?). So while not a strict rule, it is pretty common.  As for the wibbly-wobbly rules, well for example a commit may inadvertently fix a security issue, one that nobody realizes exists. This happens all the time. Sometimes post commit reviews/backports/etc cause someone to examine it and realize it is a security issue. Some people consider this to be "public" info, others do not, some (like myself) would say "it depends" (but then I would also say "embargo only the things that matter").  Should we have agreed upon rules and standards? Hahahaha, not going to happen. Should we have a rough framework/matrix (e.g. more embargo/less embargo, more coordinated/less coordinated, etc.) so we at least know where people are coming from and what their expectations are when we want to work with them? Not a terrible idea I think.    -- Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
