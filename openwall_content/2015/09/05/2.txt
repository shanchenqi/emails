This is an excellent analysis but does it hinge upon the util-linux "aren't running suid" behaviour in mount? Does it matter that the busybox mount, for example, doesn't appear to have this same requirement? I don't see any corresponding code in:   I'm certainly no busybox expert but nothing looks like a corresponding uid == 0 && euid == 0 check. The call to sanitize_env_if_suid() even suggests setuid execution is expected and anticipated.
