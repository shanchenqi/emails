One conceivable exception is a mount implementation that maintains an association between each mount entry and the real UID that established that mount entry, and also requires a special option for root to unmount a filesystem that was mounted by a non-root user. For example, if a setuid(0) call failed during a mount, then there could be an association between /home/alice/fs1 and alice's real UID. Here, root would be authorized to unmount /home/alice/fs1, but the specific /bin/umount command-line options hardcoded in glusterfs would not work. Therefore, alice might be forced to leave /home/alice/fs1 mounted unless she were able to cause a setuid(0) call to fail during an unmount. This might have security relevance if /home/alice/fs1 contained private files, and alice's original intention was to have that filesystem mounted for a very short time.  We don't know if any real mount software meets those requirements.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =4yop -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
