I don't imagine anyone would be surprised that I found vulnerabilities.  -------------------------------  SecurityMoz Security Audit  https://wordpress.org/plugins/securemoz-security-audit/  file_get_contents() + explicitly HTTP (no TLS) -> unserialize()  -------------------------------  WP Limit Login Attempts  https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-limit-login-attempts/  Trivial SQL injection via HTTP headers.       $ip = getip();      $tablename = $wpdb->prefix."limit_login";      $tablerows = $wpdb->get_results( "SELECT `login_id`, `login_ip`,`login_attempts`,`attempt_time`,`locked_time` FROM  `$tablename`   WHERE `login_ip` =  '$ip'  ORDER BY `login_id` DESC LIMIT 1 " );       //      function getip(){            if (!empty($_SERVER['HTTP_CLIENT_IP'])) {             $ip = $_SERVER['HTTP_CLIENT_IP'];         } elseif (!empty($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'])) {             $ip = $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'];         } else {             $ip = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];              if($ip=='::1'){                  $ip =              }         }         return $ip;     }  -------------------------------  I'm not sure if it's even worth assigning a CVE to any of these. Maybe the SQLi one? I leave that decision in MITRE's capable hands.  Also, Tor Blocker (link below) uses HTTP to grab the list of IP addresses to block. It's telling and appropriate that the person who developed a plugin to oppose a privacy technology would fail to use TLS.  https://wordpress.org/plugins/tor-exit-nodes-blocker/  (Surely no one would ever think to hack an upstream router and MitM the connection to block the blog administrator from their own blog or allow Tor nodes through!)  That's all from me. I might keep poking at some of the fatter plugins to see what I can find.
