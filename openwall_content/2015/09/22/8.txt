This allows for for cookies to be forged  by the Cordova application, or for the file payload to be replaced in some  situations.  Remotely hosted applications and applications developed with  Cordova that allow the user to manually enter the filename are  especially vulnerable to this issue.  Upgrade path:  Developers who are concerned about this issue should install version  or higher of the Cordova File Transfer Plugin and rebuild their  applications.  This plugin now conforms with and no longer allows  non-ASCII characters and control characters in header names or values.  Any non-ASCII characters will be removed from the header.  Developers should be aware,  and encode these characters before adding the values to the header.  Credit:  This issue was discovered by Muneaki Nishimura (Sony Digital Network Applications, Inc.)
