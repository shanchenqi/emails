Doing so makes > this method publishable  Use  We think this might be a somewhat unusual vulnerability cause. See "Zope has few restrictions on publishable objects. The basic rule is that the object must have a doc string. This requirement goes for method objects too. Another requirement is that a publishable object must not have a name that begin with an underscore. These two restrictions are designed to keep private objects from being published." on the http://docs.zope.org/zope2/zdgbook/ObjectPublishing.html page.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  uCaG/GraegoAXNKsWjDV =6/gi -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
