These issues were reported by James Forshaw (Google).  Issue 1: Local Elevation of Privilege on Windows by abusing               drive letter handling.  Issue 2: Local Elevation of Privilege on Windows caused by incorrect               Impersonation Token Handling.  Issue 1 is critical.  A fix has already been developed. Version of VeraCrypt will be released soon to address those issues.  For your information, I have sent a similar CVE request to mitre.org.
