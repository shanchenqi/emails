I discovered possible DoS attack in any software which uses  Email::Address perl module for parsing string input to list of email  addresses.  By default Email::Address module, version (and all before) try to  understand nestable comments in input string with deep level 2.  Parsing nestable comments is for specially prepared inputs too slow and  can cause high CPU load, freezing application and Denial of Service.  Because input string for Email::Address module comes from external  source (e.g. from email sent by attacker) it is security problem all  software application which parse email messages by Email::Address perl  module. For example: RT: Request Tracker, CiderWebmail, ...  In new version of Email::Address module, released at Sep 19 was  set default value of nestable comments to deep level 1. This is not  proper fix, just workaround for pathological inputs with nestable  comments. Probably nobody has normal usage for inserting nested comments  into email address in To:/Cc: headers...    Can you assign CVE id for this problem?  In attachment I'm sending example perl script which uses Email::Address  module for parsing From header and example input.  On my machine that script runs 5 seconds and it parse just four  addresses. Imagine that attacker send email with Cc: header with 10  times more addresses and Email::Address module effectively DoS server  where is that parser running...  --  Pali Rohรกr pali.rohar@...il.com  View attachment "address-line" of type "text/plain" bytes)  Download attachment "address-line-test.pl" of type "application/x-perl" bytes)  Download attachment "signature.asc " of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
