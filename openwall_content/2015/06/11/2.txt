Added email header syntax to patches, for e.g. git-am.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  With the introduction of version 2 grant table operations, a version check became necessary for most grant table related hypercalls.  The GNTTABOP_swap_grant_ref call was lacking such a check.  As a result, the subsequent code behaved as if version 2 was in use, when a guest issued this hypercall without a prior GNTTABOP_setup_table or GNTTABOP_set_version.  The effect is a possible NULL pointer dereferences.  However, this cannot be exploited to elevate privileges of the attacking domain, as the maximum memory address that can be wrongly accessed this way is bounded to far below the start of hypervisor memory.  IMPACT ======  Malicious or buggy guest domain kernels can mount a denial of service attack which, if successful, can affect the whole system.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen versions from 4.2 onwards are vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  There is no mitigation available.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.         xen-unstable, Xen 4.5.x, Xen 4.4.x, Xen 4.3.x, Xen 4.2.x  $  $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)  For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information, consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:   http://www.xenproject.org/security-policy.html -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =sqdZ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
