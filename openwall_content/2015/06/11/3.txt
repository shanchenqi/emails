Added email header syntax to patches, for e.g. git-am.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  A buggy loop in Xen's compat_iret() function iterates the wrong way around a 32-bit index.  Any 32-bit PV guest kernel can trigger this vulnerability by attempting a hypercall_iret with EFLAGS.VM set.  Given the use of __get/put_user(), and that the virtual addresses in question are contained within the lower canonical half, the guest cannot clobber any hypervisor data.  Instead, Xen will take up to pagefaults, in sequence, effectively hanging the host.  IMPACT ======  Malicious guest administrators can cause a denial of service affecting the whole system.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Only 64-bit x86 builds of Xen are vulnerable.  32-bit builds (necessarily of Xen 4.2 or earlier), are not affected.  Xen versions 3.1 or later are vulnerable.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.  Only 32-bit PV guests can exploit the vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  Systems which only need to run 32-bit guests and are running Xen 4.2 or earlier can avoid the vulnerability by using a 32-bit build of Xen instead of a 64-bit build.  (The dom0 operating system would have to be 32-bit too.)  If the boot process and kernel for the guest can be controlled, forcing it to use a 64-bit kernel will avoid the vulnerability.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Andrew Cooper of Citrix.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.  $  $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)  For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information, consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:   http://www.xenproject.org/security-policy.html -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =yJg0 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
