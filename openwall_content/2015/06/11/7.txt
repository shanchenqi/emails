However, I looked back at my pending requests and found them rather unextraordinary. Unless I am missing something, there doesn't appear to be anything particularly complex in my reports that would merit extended internal MITRE discussion let alone four months of discussions.  > If anyone needs additional confirmation that a request has indeed been > received and read, and that we are aware of it remaining unanswered, > sending directly to the cve-assign@...re.org address is the best > option.  I'm not the only reporter awaiting feedback/response from MITRE. This is why a public status update from MITRE is a lot more valuable to the oss-sec community (and beyond) than are updates provided privately to individual reporters.  --mancha  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
