We're not sure that the MITRE CVE team can provide a useful answer unless the question is made more specific.  Do you mean something like:    The product's documentation states that it is fully compliant with   RFC including "3.2 ... Prior to accepting a signed response as   valid, OCSP clients SHALL confirm that: ... 2. The signature on the   response is valid."    There is a comment in the source code such as:   /* by policy, we do not validate the signature */    Also, the actual implementation does not validate the signature.  ? This type of issue could typically have a CVE ID for something like "misleads users about whether a security feature is offered."  Or, do you mean that the product's documentation doesn't claim full RFC compliance, and signatures aren't validated for a reason such as:    - the vendor feels that online revocation checking, for certificates     of web sites, is a fundamentally flawed idea and does not want to     bother writing any code (such as the signature-validation part) to     support that    - the vendor feels that online revocation checking, for certificates     of web sites, is a fundamentally flawed idea and has disabled     their already-written code in a political/advocacy move to try     to discourage use of OCSP    - the vendor feels that validation loops are a more relevant threat     than bad signatures    - the vendor is willing to accept the risk of bad signatures     because they feel it's important to accept information about     a revocation whenever that information is even possibly valid      ? These would not have CVE IDs. If "by policy" means "for an unknown policy reason" then we feel that there probably wouldn't be a CVE ID. Vendors that don't want to develop or maintain OCSP code are very often doing that for arguably legitimate reasons.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =Uh4a -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
