Levin" <ldv@...linux.org> To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: Linux-PAM released to address  Hello,  The Linux-PAM project has released a new version to address a security issue in the pam_unix module.  If the process executing pam_sm_authenticate or pam_sm_chauthtok method of pam_unix is not privileged enough to check the password, e.g. if selinux is enabled, the _unix_run_helper_binary function is called. When a long enough password is supplied (16 pages or more, i.e. bytes on a system with 4K pages), this helper function hangs indefinitely, blocked in the write(2) call while writing to a blocking pipe that has a limited capacity.  This bug may have security implications, e.g. allowing potential attackers to conduct username enumeration and denial of service attacks.  We would like to thank Sebastien Macke of Trustwave SpiderLabs for the original bug report and Red Hat security response team for forwarding this issue.  The code implementing pam_exec expose_authtok option and pam_unix_passwd.c had a similar issue but its security implications are not obvious.  In the fix prepared by Tomas Mraz for this Linux-PAM release the verifiable password length is limited to PAM_MAX_RESP_SIZE bytes (i.e. bytes).  An alternative approach to fix this issue (implemented in such modules as pam_tcb) is to temporary ignore SIGPIPE and check for a failed/short write.  This alternative was considered too complex for a security fix, though, and the simpler fix was chosen.   --  ldv  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
