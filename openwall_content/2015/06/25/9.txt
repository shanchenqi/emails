No. There would be separate CVE IDs if it were a conceptually identical vulnerability in different code found in different codebases. We do not assign multiple CVE IDs to the same vulnerability in the same piece of code, regardless of how or why that code has been copied into different projects. This is a case with reuse of an entire substantial function: the function name is the same, the code structure is the same, names of variables and structure members are largely the same, etc. The reuse extends to pit_ioport_write as well.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =0Eos -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
