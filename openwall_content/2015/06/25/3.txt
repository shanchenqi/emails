Is there any related security problem caused by this possible inconsistency in the code:    define( 'ANYBODY', 0 );    function access_get_global_level            if( empty( $p_user_id ) && !auth_is_user_authenticated() ) {                   return false;     function access_get_project_level            if( empty( $p_user_id ) && !auth_is_user_authenticated() ) {                   return ANYBODY;  ? In other words, is an unauthenticated client sometimes, but not always, considered to have the ANYBODY access level?  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =gKYK -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
