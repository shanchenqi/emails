CVE assigned.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Device model code dealing with guest PCI MSI-X interrupt management activities logs messages on certain (supposedly) invalid guest operations.  IMPACT ======  A buggy or malicious guest repeatedly invoking such operations may result in the host disk to fill up, possibly leading to a Denial of Service.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen versions 3.3 and onwards are vulnerable due to supporting PCI pass-through.  Only x86 systems are vulnerable.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.  Only HVM guests with their device model run in Dom0 can take advantage of this vulnerability.  Only HVM guests which have been granted access to physical PCI devices (`PCI passthrough') can take advantage of this vulnerability.  Furthermore, the vulnerability is only applicable when the passed-through PCI devices are MSI-X capable.  (Many modern devices are.)  MITIGATION ==========  This issue can be avoided by not assigning MSI-X capable PCI devices to untrusted HVM guests.  This issue can also be avoided by only using PV guests.  It can also be avoided by configuring HVM guests with their device model run in a separate (stub) domain.  (When using xl, this can be requested with "device_model_stubdomain_override=1" in the domain configuration file.)  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            qemu-upstream-unstable, Xen 4.5.x, Xen 4.4.x       Xen 4.3.x           qemu-xen-unstable, Xen 4.5.x, Xen 4.4.x, Xen 4.3.x, Xen 4.2.x  $    $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
