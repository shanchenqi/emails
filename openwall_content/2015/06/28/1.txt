The cms.changelist.js and cms.toolbar.js changes include a comment "send post request to prevent xss attacks." The "xss" word choice might be a mistake. We are not currently assigning a CVE ID for a separate XSS issue.  > Sylvain Fankhauser of L//P and Matthew Wilkes of The Code Distillery, > who discovered and privately demonstrated to the django CMS core > developers an important CSRF vulnerability and contacted us through > the documented channels.  CVE IDs were not assigned on a per-discoverer basis here because there was no available information suggesting that different persons independently discovered different CSRF problems.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =3AtE -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
