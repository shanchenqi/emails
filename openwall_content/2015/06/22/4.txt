The error messages included some of these URL params, resulting in a cross site scripting attack. This affects users on Mozilla Firefox but not Chromium/Google Chrome.  API paths with issues:  * /api/contents * /api/notebooks  Mitigations:  Upgrade to IPython 3.2. If using pip,    pip install --upgrade ipython[notebook]  For conda:    conda update conda   conda update ipython ipython-notebook  If you can't upgrade directly,  * Set the content security policy for the API headers of the notebook to include `default-src 'none'` ( https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/whatsnew/version3.html#content-security-policy ) * Set the content type on API handlers to application/json  Vulnerability was found by Ahmad Khan, Security Engineer at IBM.   --  Kyle Kelley (@rgbkrk <https://twitter.com/rgbkrk>; lambdaops.com, developer.rackspace.com)   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
