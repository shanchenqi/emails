PCRE is a regular expression C library inspired by the regular expression capabilities in the Perl programming language. The PCRE library is incorporated into a number of prominent programs, such as Adobe Flash, Apache, Nginx, PHP.   PCRE library is prone to a vulnerability which leads to Heap Overflow. During the compilation of a malformed regular expression, more data is written on the malloced block than the expected size output by compile_regex. Exploits with advanced Heap Fengshui techniques may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the user running the affected application.   Reference:   Please note that this (and couple of other issues discovered by fuzzing) is fixed in the source tree.   Wen Guanxing from Venustech ADLAB is credited for this vulnerability.
