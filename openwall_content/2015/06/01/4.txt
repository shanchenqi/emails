Use for:    very similiar issue located in do_soap_call() (called by __call(),   indeed).    in do_soap_call()    if (call_uri == NULL) {      call_uri = Z_STRVAL_PP(uri);   }    where uri comes from zend_hash_find(Z_OBJPROP_P(this_ptr), "uri",   sizeof("uri"), (void *)&uri), line    If the "uri" field has been previously unserialized as an int, this   could still result in an info leak whereas the attacker would be able   to control a str.val field of a zval.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =jLhj -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
