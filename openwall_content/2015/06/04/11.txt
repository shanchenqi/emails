Use  In reading your advisory, we weren't able to determine if there are any realistic scenarios in which an authenticated user would intentionally use csp_po_scan_source_file or csp_po_save_catalog_entry for RCE (i.e., scenarios that do not involve CSRF) and thereby obtain additional access to the server machine. We think you may mean scenarios in which the authenticated user has the manage_options capability but not the edit_plugins capability.  (As always, to obtain multiple CVE IDs for a report, it is useful to describe all of the substantially distinct scenarios, not only the scenarios in which risk is greatest.)  Also, we did not understand whether the "Multiple XSS in various AJAX actions ... reflected unescaped POST parameters in certain AJAX actions' responses" issue is independently relevant. Do you mean that there is unescaped reflection regardless of whether the AJAX action is authorized? More specifically, if all of the CSRF issues in the plugin were fixed in a normal way, would unauthenticated attackers be able to conduct XSS attacks by hosting JavaScript code that forces an administrator's browser to make a POST request without a nonce?  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJVcLnjAAoJEKllVAevmvmsH/EH+gJtzMpmfDSZvNRUMm+FvmwE =yWSh -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
