(adding a file extension whitelist) > * New CVE = incomplete fix in 2.5 (adding a filename suffix blacklist)  We haven't been able to figure out why another ID would be needed. The year portion of a CVE ID typically refers to when the vulnerability became publicly known, not (for example) when the vulnerability was introduced. Before this year, apparently nobody had disclosed that there was a vulnerability in version 2.2 or later in which a .php file, but not an arbitrary file, could be downloaded. Also, the phpMyBackupPro doc/HISTORY.txt doesn't have any entries that we would consider sufficiently close to a disclosure of that .php download vulnerability.  So:    = original fully-arbitrary file download                   (the known affected version is 2.1)     = download of specific configuration files                   with a ../../files/filename.php request (the                   presumed affected versions are at least 2.1 through                   2.4)                    (other files with approved extensions can also be                   downloaded, but this is intentional behavior, not                   part of the vulnerability)     = download of specific configuration files                   with a ../../files/../files/filename.php request                   (the presumed affected version are at least 2.1                   through 2.5)                    (again, other files with approved extensions can                   also be downloaded, but this is intentional                   behavior, not part of the vulnerability)                 exists because of an incomplete fix for exists because of an incomplete fix for  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =PQsw -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
