Do you have a specific viewpoint about what the CVE ID should be for? In particular, is the essence of the request that the Redis upstream vendor believes that loading Lua bytecode was, by itself, inherently an implementation mistake in Redis, and is now fixed by the change?  By way of background: we have previously tried to gather information for assigning CVE IDs to the underlying bytecode security concerns in Lua (see the post), but this was unsuccessful. If the currently needed CVE ID should be only about Redis, as mentioned in the above paragraph, then we will not be revisiting those Lua issues now.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =J2bY -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
