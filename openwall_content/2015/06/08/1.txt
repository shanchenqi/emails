Earlier this year, we decided to start a curated list for learning about application security and host it on Github.  Currently, we have a good spread of general topics and PHP-specific security pitfalls, but we'd like to gather more resources to help developers with experience in a particular language learn how to build more resilient applications.  https://github.com/paragonie/awesome-appsec  The list lives at that URL, please send pull requests. It's as easy as creating a .json file somewhere appropriately within the data/ directory; I'll take care of the rest.
