Earlier this year, we decided to start a curated list for learning about application security and host it on Github.  Currently, we have a good spread of general topics and PHP-specific security pitfalls, but we'd like to gather more resources to help developers with experience in a particular language learn how to build more resilient applications. https://github.com/paragonie/awesome-appsec  The list lives at that URL, please send pull requests. It's as easy as creating a .json file somewhere appropriately within the data/ directory; I'll take care of the rest.

However, the reality of the situation is that programmers are often responsible for configuring systems.  So thank you. I'll check it out tonight and consider its inclusion.
