In this situation, we're not sure that there's any practical way for us to distill that into a consensus statement of what the CVE or CVEs would be for.  The original message seems to be about clients whereas the first message seems to be about users or uids. Is there any polkit documentation that suggests that two clients are allowed to interfere with each other as long as they have the same uid? (This is in the general case where at least one of the two clients is executing with substantial restrictions.)  For purposes of CVE, we may be able to model this as a situation in which the (realistically exploitable) counter wraparound is a clear implementation error and can have a CVE ID, but the concept of uid matching is a design change that is essentially outside the scope of CVE. Would that be OK?  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =+9Uv -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
