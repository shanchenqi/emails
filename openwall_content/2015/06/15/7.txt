Anyway, it's missing).  The seed is not public, but you missed one detail: there are only one million different ones.  This seed is the only input of the PRNG.  With one million starting points (which is a lot less then the complete state) you can easily brute force the seed for the returned values. After you know the complete state, you can calculate possible state ranges for different PID.
