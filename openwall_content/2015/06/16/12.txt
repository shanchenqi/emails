In this type of situation, CVEs are assigned on a per-discoverer basis. is for thoger@...hat.com discoveries, whereas is for yohgaki@....net. See:       > dir()/opendir() and chroot()  Four weeks ago, we asked security@....net to contact us if those other changed functions were associated with vulnerability fixes. They have not contacted us about this.  Are you reporting that some or all of them had vulnerabilities?  For example, is it reasonable to expect that a PHP application may want the client to make a choice of a chroot directory, and the intended behavior is to restrict the choice to a name ending in ".d" but this can be bypassed by something like a "/usr/local/var/x/does-not-end-in-dot-d\0.d" value?   > > > > More / / like issues.

Use for the violation of the "mget() guarantees buf <= last" constraint suggested in the UTC] comment.  Use for the issue in which offset can exceed bytecnt, suggested in the UTC] comment.  These might be conceptually overlapping discoveries, but we decided to have the two CVE IDs.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =CFDR -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
