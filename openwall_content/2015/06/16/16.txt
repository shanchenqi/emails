This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier  Versions Affected:  All. Not affected:       None. Fixed Versions:      Impact  ------  Specially crafted XML documents can cause applications to raise a `SystemStackError` and potentially cause a denial of service attack.  This only impacts applications using REXML or JDOM as their XML processor.  Other XML processors that Rails supports are not impacted.  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the work arounds immediately.   Releases  --------  The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.   Workarounds  -----------  Use an XML parser that is not impacted by this problem, such as Nokogiri or LibXML.  You can change the processor like this:    ActiveSupport::XmlMini.backend = 'Nokogiri'  If you cannot change XML parsers, then adjust `RUBY_THREAD_MACHINE_STACK_SIZE`.  Patches  -------  To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series.  They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.   * 4-2-xml_depth.patch - Patch for 4.2 series  * 4-1-xml_depth.patch - Patch for 4.1 series  * 3-2-xml_depth.patch - Patch for 3.2 series   Please note that only the 4.2.x and 4.1.x series are supported at present.  Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.
