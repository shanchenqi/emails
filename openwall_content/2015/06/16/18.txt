This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier  Versions Affected:  All Not affected:       Environments inaccessible from remote IPs, or without Web Console enabled Fixed Versions:      Impact  ------  Specially crafted remote requests can spoof their origin, bypassing the IP whitelist, in any environment where Web Console is enabled (development and test, by default).  Users whose application is only accessible from localhost (as is the default behaviour in Rails 4.2) are not affected, unless a local proxy is involved.  All affected users should either upgrade or use one of the work arounds immediately.   Releases  --------  The release is available at the normal locations.   Workarounds  -----------  To work around this issue, turn off web-console in all environments, by removing/commenting it from the application's Gemfile.  Patches  -------  To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series.  They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.   * 2-1-ip-whitelist.patch - Patch for 2.1 series   Please note that only the 2.1.x series is supported at present.  Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.  Credits  -------  This vulnerability was reported by both joernchen of Phenoelit and Ben Murphy.  Thanks to each of them for reporting the issue to us and verifying the fix.  --  Aaron Patterson http://tenderlovemaking.com/  View attachment "2-1-ip-whitelist.patch" of type "text/plain" bytes)  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
