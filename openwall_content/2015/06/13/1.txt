In Cinder these calls are done as root.  This allows the attacker to play the format guessing in qemu-img by providing input with a qcow2 signature.  If this signature contains a base file, this file will be read by a process running as root and embedded in the output.  This bug is similar to and has been assigned  Tested with: lvm backed volume storage in Cinder, it may apply to others as well.  Steps to reproduce: - create volume and attach to vm, - create a qcow2 signature on the volume containing a base-file[1] from   within the vm and - trigger an upload to Glance with "cinder upload-to-image --disk-type   qcow2"[2]. The image uploaded to Glance will have the base-file from the cinder-volume host embedded.  Affected versions: tested on found while reading  Timeline: - Reported upstream - Published  Regards, Bastian Blank  [1]: qemu-img create -f qcow2 -b /etc/passwd /dev/vdb [2]: The disk-type != raw triggers the use of "qemu-img convert" --  You can't evaluate a man by logic alone. 		-- McCoy, "I, Mudd", stardate  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
