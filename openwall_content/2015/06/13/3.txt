The manage_options capability is required to trigger any of the RCE'able actions, hence normal users (without the capability) cannot exploit them (unless they target an administrator with a CSRF attack, as described in the advisory.)  However, I hadn't considered users with the manage_options capability exploiting the RCE'able actions themselves. So yes, I suppose Administrators could use this to escalate to Super Administrator on multisite WordPress installations (multisite Super Administrators get extra capabilities compared to normal Administrators; see <https://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities#Super_Admin> and <https://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities#Additional_Admin_Capabilities>)  > (As always, to obtain multiple CVE IDs for a report, it is useful to > describe all of the substantially distinct scenarios, not only the > scenarios in which risk is greatest.) > > Also, we did not understand whether the "Multiple XSS in various AJAX > actions ... reflected unescaped POST parameters in certain AJAX > actions' responses" issue is independently relevant.

No, the actions have appropriate authorisation checks and will not be vulnerable to XSS if the caller is unauthorised.  > More specifically, if all of the CSRF issues in the plugin > were fixed in a normal way, would unauthenticated attackers be able to > conduct XSS attacks by hosting JavaScript code that forces an > administrator's browser to make a POST request without a nonce?  Assuming that the usual WordPress anti-CSRF nonces were added in the appropriate locations, i.e., to the csp_po_check_security function, then no.  - Matthew  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
