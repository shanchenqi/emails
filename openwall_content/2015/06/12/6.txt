Luckily, Jann was persistent enough and tested OpenVZ for this issue, and found it vulnerable, and reported the issue to OpenVZ developers.  Thanks!  So, yes, OpenVZ simfs-based (but not ploop-based) containers turned out to be affected by this issue, allowing an in-container root to access outside files up to the mount point of the underlying filesystem (so e.g. up to /vz if a separate filesystem is mounted on /vz on a server).  With proper bind mount(s) already precreated, a non-root in-container user could exploit this as well, but that's uncommon.  OpenVZ bug:  OpenVZ/RHEL6 fix:  OpenVZ/RHEL5 fix:  (And a fix went into Owl last night.)  A slightly simpler variation of the attack, without a "d" directory:  cd / mkdir a a/b c mount -o bind a c cd c/b mv /a/b / ls -l ../../../../../..
