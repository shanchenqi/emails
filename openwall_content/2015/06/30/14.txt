No, in general, repackaging doesn't mean that there can be new CVEs as a result of a reevaluation of whether any part of a product's configuration/behavior would have been chosen differently if it had been the repackager's own original code.  There can, however, be new CVEs for new interaction errors. For example, if a Linux distribution shipped that product with upstream's standard default config-file permissions, but simultaneously shipped a setup tool that required a password in the database URI (without addressing file permissions during setup, and without showing the file contents to the user), then there would need to be a CVE for something, because there is no way to use that combination safely. Most likely the CVE would name the setup tool as the primary affected product/component.  This would apply in essentially the same way if it weren't a standalone setup tool, but were instead a module for a larger configuration-management product. If a module is intended to modify configuration files, it seems that the module author has (at least some) responsibility for avoiding introduction of vulnerabilities into the configuration. This configuration-management module topic may have some open questions. However, as far as we know, people haven't been submitting many CVE requests about vulnerabilities that were caused when a module didn't incorporate complete knowledge of configuration-file semantics.  > Date: Tue, 30 Jun > From: Seth Arnold <seth.arnold@...onical.com> >  > Did the vendor also fill in a password? If so, that's worth a CVE to me.  We agree that this is a straightforward case that would have a CVE. This is, more or less, an extreme example of the setup-tool case described above: either way, the vendor has forced the product into an always-unsafe state.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =0CLn -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
