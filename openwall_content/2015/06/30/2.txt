For me, that means: the developers did their best, everything else is up to package maintainers.  And, obviously, when the administrators will fill in the connection parameters, they most likely will see this warning.   > I'm thinking we need proper permissions and not a note (especially  > with administration tools/etc that may parse/modify the file  > but not change the perms).  My experience says that developers' attempts to perform chmod (or, even worse, chown) during `make install` are just ugly (at least they never check whether DESTDIR is empty).   --  Alexey V.
