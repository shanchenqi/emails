CVE covers the ("Incorrect Default Permissions") issue and similar weak-permissions issues as long as a security boundary is crossed. A security boundary would be crossed on a general-purpose, multi-user computer, as well as on most other multi-user platforms. Typically there is an exception in the case of an embedded device where a multi-user level of access control isn't set up and wasn't ever intended or documented by the vendor. For example, obtaining an OS image of an arbitrary embedded device, and noting that it has a filesystem that supports file permissions, doesn't necessarily imply anything about what those permissions were supposed to be.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJVkwvZAAoJEKllVAevmvmsjSsIALdZzYAdIBfjW1UlQEfKwP7Z =YCxq -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
