If it > # contains a password, make sure to adjust the permissions of the config  The scope of CVE typically does not include opportunities for improvements to file permissions. In some cases, these are covered in CCE, e.g.,          CCE Description    Access to Apache's httpd.conf file should be configured appropriately.    CCE Technical Mechanisms    defined by (ServerRoot)\conf\httpd.conf's DACL      (httpd.conf is often a non-sensitive file.)  The scope of CVE does include implementation errors that the author of a product wishes to announce as a vulnerability. So, for example, the author of this:    # Install binaries with mode   install -m "$SRC/bin/mybinary1" "$DST/bin/mybinary1"   install -m "$SRC/bin/mybinary2" "$DST/bin/mybinary2"    # Install config files with mode IMPORTANT!   install -m "$SRC/etc/myconf1.conf" "$DST/etc/myconf1.conf"   install -m "$SRC/etc/myconf2.conf" "$DST/etc/myconf2.conf"  could ask for a CVE ID.  In the "If it contains a password, make sure" scenario that you mentioned, it seems entirely reasonable for the default permissions to reflect the author's preference for the normal case. (A password in a URI might be rare.) In other words, the author may want to optimize for situations where configuration data is read by users or administrators who login with an unprivileged account for most day-to-day work. Alternatively, in some cases a configuration approach could be redesigned to use separate files for sensitive data elements.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =tJ2b -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
