If it # contains a password, make sure to adjust the permissions of the config ########  Is that good enough, e.g. no CVE, or do we actually need to have proper permissions?  I'm thinking we need proper permissions and not a note (especially with administration tools/etc that may parse/modify the file but not change the perms). Thoughts/comments/final decision from Mitre is welcome.  --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
