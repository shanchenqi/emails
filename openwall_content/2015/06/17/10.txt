This issue has already been made public to both projects, with recommendations on how to fix them, but a fix has not been released by the project maintainers.  Sasquatch is an experimental fork of squashfs-tools. Squashfs-tools is present in the repositories of Debian, CentOS, and other Linux distributions.  The vulnerability can be exploited by using the unsquashfs command to unpack a malicious squashfs image that causes a stack overflow in an unchecked variable length array. Thereafter, a function that copies data from the squashfs image to the overflown array is executed.  Iâm requesting a CVE number for this vulnerability,  per project.
