DecodeImage() does not check that the run-length "count" fits into the total size of the image, which can lead to a heap-based buffer overflow. I've not assigned a CVE ID to this (mainly because I'm not sure if this warrants a new CVE or should be bundled with so I leave that up to the CVE experts on the list).  We have some possible fixes in our bug [1], but be cautious - these are not fully vetted yet. So far, however, they look fine to me.
