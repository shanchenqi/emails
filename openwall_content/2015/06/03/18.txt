What makes uudecode different is that the discovery was an out-of-bounds read, and uudecode is neither a library nor a multiple-input program. (Wireshark is a multiple-input program in the sense that it is commonly used for live packet capture, and must remain running to capture packets that are sent later. Some other programs are multiple-input programs because they maintain the state of multiple sessions.)  In these situations (i.e., OOB-read library=no multiple-input=no), obtaining a CVE ID currently requires a realistic scenario with a security impact. One class of scenarios, as mentioned, is data exfiltration. Another possible class of scenarios involves a read operation that triggers a change to the program's control flow.  We're not sure that it would be worthwhile to try to document (in advance) all possible combinations of product attributes and issue categories, in order to suggest which combinations need more impact analysis than others.  Also, we realize that some oss-security readers may be very interested in crash reports that ultimately cannot have CVE IDs. For example, these reports may help to suggest a specific type of code-quality problem in a named product, and that information could be quite useful in choosing the direction of follow-on research into exploitable problems in that product.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =MmOo -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
