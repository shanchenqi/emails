Use  We realize that there was debate about whether it is right to assign a CVE ID. Here's a comment on that. (The rest of this message doesn't have any discussion of this old kernel vulnerability itself.)  > From: Greg KH <greg@...ah.com> > Date: Fri, 29 May >  > And that's it, it's not a "we need to track this", for such old bugs > (and by "old" I would classify anything older than a year for the kernel > as old, as that's hundreds of thousands of patches ago)?

Our perspective is that there are (at least) three different issues related to oss-security messages about a fixed-two-years-ago bug.    1. Possibly the bug should not be discussed here because too few      people are interested. If the list rules were changed from      "Public security issues only" to something like "Recent public      security issues only," then we would follow the new rules. We      haven't announced a preference for whether there should be a      change. Also, everyone already has the option to self-select,      e.g., if a person thinks their security issue is less interesting      because it's two years old, they could choose to send their CVE      request only to MITRE directly. There are no cases in which we      require anyone to send any request to oss-security.    2. Possibly a CVE ID should not be sent here because that, in      effect, means everyone receives twice as many messages about      fixed-two-years-ago bugs. It's conceivable that MITRE could make      it easier for people to filter out these messages, e.g., if we      added something in the header whenever a message from us was only      about an ID number and wasn't an attempt to contribute to      discussing a vulnerability.    3. Possibly a new CVE ID should not exist at all for a      fixed-two-years-ago bug. This is a type of change that MITRE      conceivably might want to make in the future. Right now, however,      we haven't ever announced that a CVE request has to be within N      months or years of a bug fix or disclosure, and we're not going      to be changing that abruptly. More specifically, we're not going      to abruptly drop support for an existing use case in which      companies who ship older kernels can have CVEs for older issues.      This doesn't mean that we can add new support for all possible      alternative use cases, e.g., bulk requests for every current bug.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =r/3a -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
