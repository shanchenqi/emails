The PCRE library is incorporated into a number of prominent programs, such as Adobe Flash, Apache, Nginx, PHP.   PCRE library is prone to a vulnerability which leads to Stack Overflow. Without enough bound checking inside match(), the stack memory could be overflowed via a crafted regular expression. Since PCRE library is widely used, this vulnerability should affect many applications. At least, an attacker may exploit this issue to DOS the user running the affected application.
