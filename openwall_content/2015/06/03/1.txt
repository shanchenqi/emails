For example, can any of these occur on actual systems?  1. The attacker e-mails a uuencoded file to their own mailbox on a web-based mail service. This service has a feature in which decoded data is presented to the recipient. (The server operates on the data with the uudecode program, not with any other implementation of the uudecode algorithm. The attacker gains read access to unintended parts of the server's memory.)  2. A web site allows users to do HTTP uploads of data in uuencoded format, and supports requests for decoded versions of the data. Same parenthesized description as above.  3. The attacker composes a news article with crafted uuencoded data and posts it to the alt.sources Usenet newsgroup. The attacker is subscribed to this newsgroup in their own account on a web-based Usenet news reading service. Same parenthesized description as above.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =xMZZ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
