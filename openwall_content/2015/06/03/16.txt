To answer these questions to the best of my knowledge: I don't know.  This is a question I think I can answer in a very general fashion. I find and report these out of bounds vulns very often. I can confirm that in your described scenarios an attacker could trigger an out of bounds read. If that can in anyway be used to exfiltrate data or other attacks: I don't know. In this case it's probably unlikely, because as you can see the oob read is just one byte.  Analyzing the impact of these kinds of vulns would require digging and understanding the code in detail by someone skilled in memory corruption exploitation (that means: not me).  What I can say is that many very similar issues I reported in the past got CVEs (lately e.g. in wireshark and curl). And there'll probably be a lot more in the near future. I started trying to write up reports for all issues of these kinds I reported once they got fixed.  If you prefere not to be bothered about out of bounds issues with unknown impact any more I am fine with that and will stop cc-ing. Also - if the people on oss-security feel that my reports on these minor issues are too frequently please tell me and I'll stop sending them. But in the past I had the impression it's apprechiated and solar designer wants as much info as possible in the oss-security archives in case external sources vanish.   cu, --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
