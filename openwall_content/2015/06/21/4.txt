We did not find any documentation stating that the "verifier" complies with RFC Admittedly, it is plausible that many users expected that the verifier would comply with this RFC, just because this RFC was mentioned. The vendor's position (see the comment) is, roughly, that this verifier behavior is outside the scope of the ROTP design, and that anyone who wants this verifier behavior needs to write code or obtain code elsewhere.  Possibly a second issue is We might not understand this, but we think it essentially means that "if ROTP were to consume an OTP, then this should be done consistently for the current-timestamp case and the acceptable-past-timestamp case." So, we don't think that this is an independent concern.  We don't think there can be a CVE ID for any aspect of the report recommending that the verifier comply with RFC We agree that it would be useful for the ROTP documentation to place some emphasis on the actual verifier behavior, to cover the scenario where a user guesses that full RFC compliance was intended, and later discovers that a "MUST NOT" condition isn't met.  > NOTE: I have already sent a similar email to MITRE requesting a CVE > ID, but been advised to submit here as well (then cancel the request > to MITRE  We aren't exactly sure what this means. The MITRE CVE team currently does not advise anyone to send messages to oss-security. The "already sent" apparently refers to a message from an hour earlier. Messages for us can be sent to either oss-security or to cve-assign@...re.org but should not be sent to both addresses. Of course, we are willing to accommodate the occasional case where someone accidentally sends to cve-assign@...re.org but actually wanted to make the information public immediately on oss-security.
