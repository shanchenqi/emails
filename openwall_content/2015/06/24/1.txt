It is available here:   I am still discussing some points with upstream, but most of the issues should have no/little impact; for example the FD_SETSIZE checks are good to have but mostly appear on client side code that should not outrun the fdset; or the _exit() in the assert is in place just to ensure termination in case someone "creates" an non-exit path in the msg(M_FATAL) function by changing the muting-code or alike.  I am not requesting any CVEs.
