Description:  In MantisBT, the "Project Documentation" feature can be used to attach  files to a project.  When this feature is enabled ($g_enable_project_documentation = ON) and  the threshold to view these files is left to its default value  ($g_view_proj_doc_threshold = ANYBODY), any registered user in the  system can download every such attachment, including those which are  linked to private projects to which the user does not have access.  This can be achieved by calling the download script directly, and  specifying the ID of the file to download, e.g.    Affected versions: - <= - <=  Fixed in versions: - (not yet released) - (not yet released)  Patch: See Github [1]  Credits: The issue was discovered by Werner Karl and fixed by Damien Regad (MantisBT Developer).
