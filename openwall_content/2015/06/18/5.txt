(This doesn't mean that we would want to have separate CVEs for a developer's efforts to completely fix one type of problem in a single piece of code, before any changes were in a release, even if the efforts took a while. However, even in the case of a single piece of code, multiple CVEs can occur if there is a CVE assignment at a time when development work seems finished, and then this work continues.)  > issue affecting different module of the code base > is not a typical reason for split.  "different module" would be relevant if it were known that the code in one module was originally introduced in one version, and this was not the same version as for the other code.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =QwlQ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
