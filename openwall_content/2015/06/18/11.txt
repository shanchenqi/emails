Is the problem that the gl_errfunc assignment doesn't occur and there is always a dereference of a NULL function pointer? Is there a commonly relevant consequence other than the ability of an FTP client to conduct a DoS attack against its own session?  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJVgvkkAAoJEKllVAevmvmsAHgH/js/rXSJfKmyb+7VLsgYnzPz =1/Mw -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
