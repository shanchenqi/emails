Administrator -> web shell esclalation  I'm not sure if this is more of a bug or an exploitation technique (depending on Joomla's threat model), but once you have obtained Administrator or Super User access to a Joomla server, you can escalate to a shell on the server.  In the "media manager" options, you can add to the list of allowed file extensions.  Interestingly, if you try adding "php" to the allowed file extensions, it still won't let you upload a web shell.  As it turns out, mod-php, by default on Ubuntu, will execute any files with an extension that matches this regex : If you rename your webshell shell.php3, and add "php3" to the allowed file extensions, and it will upload just fine.  Possible fixes include tweaking the hardcoded blacklist such that it matches the default mod-php regex, not serving uploads directly from the web root, requiring shell access to modify the extension allow list, etc.  Sent a bug report to Joomla! Security Strike Team on June 2nd, no response.    - DEAN  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
