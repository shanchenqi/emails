In line with this I have made the following proposed change for Fedora (and by extensions Red Hat products):  https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Kurtseifried/secure_config_and_log_permissions  Have secure by default permissions for configuration and log files  Proposed change  All configuration files (e.g. files in /etc/) and all log files (e.g. files in /var/log/) must not be set world-readable unless there is a functional reason to do so. By default, configuration files should be chmod or and log files should be chmod This is due to a continuing number of security issues with world readable files that contain sensitive information (e.g. passwords and access tokens or logged usernames and commands for example).  Rationale  The number of security issues created by lax permissions on configuration and log files has resulted in a number of security issues exploitable by local users. E.g.:  http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=configuration+file+permissions  http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=log+file+permissions  Please note that the above lists are by no means a complete listing of the security flaws that have resulted from lax permissions.  I would invite other distros/etc to also do this.  --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
