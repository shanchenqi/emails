The PCRE library is incorporated into a number of prominent programs, such as Adobe Flash, Apache, Nginx, PHP.  PCRE library is prone to a vulnerability which leads to Heap Overflow. During subpattern calculation of a malformed regular expression, an offset that is used as an array index is fully controlled and can be large enough so that unexpected heap memory regions are accessed. One could at least exploit this issue to read objects nearby of the affected application's memory. Such information discloure may also be used to bypass memory protection method such as ASLR.  Reference:  Would you please allocate a CVE-ID for this?
