A sample POC can be trying to give the following payload while adding a new page:  Page title = *page"onmouseover="alert(1)";*  Same injection can be also done on username field while creating a new user or when editing an already existing user. So any user can purposefully add JavaScript along with his name. If the user profile page is visited by the admin or any other users, it will trigger the JavaScript.  2) *DOM Based XSS:*  DOM Based XSS occurs under every single URL below* /admin/*. A sample POC can be:     *Date of reporting:* 24th June,  *Exploit Author:* Anirudh Anand  *Vendor Homepage*: https://anchorcms.com  *Software Link:* http://anchorcms.com/download  *Version: *<  *Tested on:* Linux:- Ubuntu, Debian   The issue has been reported to the vendor:  Is it possible to assign CVE identifiers for the same ?
