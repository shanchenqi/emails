Discovered by Michael Kapfer and Sebastian Kraemer of > > HSASec.  The vulnerability was fixed with the update and was (according to your assumption) located in this call graph: ďżź - /wp-admin/async-upload.php : (Index) - - /wp-admin/includes/ajax-actions.php : wp_ajax_upload_attachment - - - /wp-includes/functions.php : wp_check_filetype_and_ext - - - - /wp-includes/functions.php : wp_check_filetype  The validation of filenames in "/wp-includes/functions.php : wp_check_filetype" failed under certain circumstances if the user provided filename contains special chars of regular expressions. 	 Exploiting this vulnerability enables users with any fileupload-privilege to upload and execute any type of files. This results in the ability of executing arbitrary code.
