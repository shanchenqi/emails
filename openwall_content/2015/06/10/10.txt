Cashdollar, @_larry0 Date: Advisory: Download Site: https://wordpress.org/plugins/se-html5-album-audio-player/ Vendor: https://profiles.wordpress.org/sedevelops/ Vendor Notified: Vendor Contact: https://profiles.wordpress.org/sedevelops/ Description:  An HTML5 Album Audio Player. A plugin to archive, present, and play collections of mp3s (or other html5 audio formats) as albums within your post.  Vulnerability: The se-html5-album-audio-player  plugin for wordpress has a remote file download vulnerability.  The download_audio.php file does not correctly check the file path, it only attempts to check if the path is in /wp-content/uploads which is easily defeated with ../.  This vulnerability doesnât require authentication to the Wordpress site.  File ./se-html5-album-audio-player/download_audio.php:   3 $file_name = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . $_GET['file'];  4 $is_in_uploads_dir = strpos($file_name, '/wp-content/uploads/');  5 // make sure it's a file before doing anything!  6 if( is_file($file_name) && $is_in_uploads_dir !== false ) {  7   8         // required for IE  9         if(ini_get('zlib.output_compression')) { ini_set('zlib.output_compression', 'Off');         } 10      11         // get the file mime type using the file extension 12         switch(strtolower(substr(strrchr($file_name, '.'), 1))) { 13                 case 'pdf': $mime = 'application/pdf'; break; 14                 case 'zip': $mime = 'application/zip'; break; 15                 case 'jpeg': 16                 case 'jpg': $mime = 'image/jpg'; break; 17                 default: $mime = 'application/force-download'; 18         } 19         header('Pragma: public');       // required 20         header('Expires: 0');           // no cache 21         header('Cache-Control: must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0'); 22         header('Last-Modified: '.gmdate ('D, d M Y H:i:s', filemtime ($file_name)).' GMT'); 23         header('Cache-Control: private',false); 24         header('Content-Type: '.$mime); 25         header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="'.basename($file_name).'"'); 26         header('Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary');         27         header('Content-Length: '.filesize($file_name));        // provide file size 28         header('Connection: close'); 29         readfile($file_name);           // push it out 30         exit();  The above code does not verify if a user is logged in, and do proper sanity checking if the file is outside of the uploads directory.
