Cashdollar, @_larry0 Date: Download Site: https://wordpress.org/plugins/xclonerbackupandrestore/ http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/accessasecurity/ sitesecurity/ Advisory: Vendor: Ovidiu Liuta, @thinkovi Vendor Contact: @thinkovi Description: XCloner is a Backup and Restore component designed for PHP/Mysql websites, it can work as a native plugin for WordPress and Joomla! Vulnerability: Lines of in cloner.functions.php  $excluded_cmd = ""; if ($fp = @fopen($_REQUEST[' if ($fp = @fopen($_REQUEST['excl_manual'], "r")) { while (!feof($fp)) $excluded_cmd .= fread($fp, fclose($fp); }  Line If configured for manual mode the contents of $excluded_cmd are passed to exec(); exec($_CONFIG[tarpath] . " $excluded_cmd ". $_CONFIG['tarcompress'] ."vf $backup_file update $file"); We need to supply a file with a list of commands to execute in it, we can create this via the backup comments feature. It creates a file under administrator/backups/.comments with whatever you want in it. Like ;id>/tmp/w00t;  Then change the configuration to manual backup by selecting the radio button and perform a backup. Hit this link:  In a shell: $ cat /tmp/w00t uid=33(wwwdata) gid=33(wwwdata) groups=33(wwwdata)  Also $excluded_cmd is XSS   Chrome XSS alert:  The XSS Auditor refused to execute a script in because its source code was found within the request.
