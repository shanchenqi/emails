If there is a  vulnerability-research category, aspect, or approach that we feel may have  unexpected concerns that are specific to CVE, we prefer to resolve that  within our team, rather than follow a piecemeal approach to the related  individual requests. Accordingly, we do not designate a timeline that  applies globally to every request. If anyone needs additional confirmation  that a request has indeed been received and read, and that we are aware of  it remaining unanswered, sending directly to the cve-assign@...re.org  address is the best option.   --- CVE Assignment Team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
