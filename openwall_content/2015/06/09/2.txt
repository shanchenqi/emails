The "Doc Text" field at says:  "It was found that the Linux kernel's implementation of vectored pipe read and write functionality did not take into account the I/O vectors that were already processed when retrying after a failed atomic access operation, potentially resulting in memory corruption due to an I/O vector array overrun."  So we're on the same page regarding "I/O vector array overrun" (rather than I/O data overrun) being the security issue here.
