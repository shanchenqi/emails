The main purpose was initially to extend SSH network features and solve some performance issues we had while using SSH on high bandwidth networks.  Currently, it is difficult to forward DNS, VoIP and other widely used UDP based protocols. Moreover, we often needed a simple way to relay traffic over multiple nodes to comply with security policies while administrating medium size networks.  These are two of the main features of SSF. It allows simple automatic traffic relay and UDP forwarding through encrypted tunnels. Of course, SSF also provides basic SSH network features like TCP forwarding and remote forwarding, SOCKS proxying (and remote proxying which is not provided by SSH). SSF command line is similar to SSH so that DevOps can benefit from performance and security enhancements without the learning curve of a new tool.  To ensure the best performances, SSF takes advantage of the multicore, multithreaded architectures by using modern asynchronous APIs based on Boost.asio.  The project provides an easy to use build system which automatically builds third-party libraries (Boost, OpenSSL and GoogleTest). Moreover, the code is compatible with C++11 which made it portable over many platforms. Currently, the build has been tested against Windows, MacOS X and Linux.  SSF is using latest OpenSSL version with perfect forward secrecy enabled by default.
