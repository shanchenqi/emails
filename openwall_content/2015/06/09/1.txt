By "substantial restrictions" you're thinking of things like SELinux policy domains?  Currently, polkit is not ready to perform compartmentalization of that form - it treats equal uids as equal security domains.  (Most importantly, uid 0 is treated as privileged, even if it's in a confined  domain)  > For purposes of CVE, we may be able to model this as a situation in > which the (realistically exploitable) counter wraparound is a clear > implementation error and can have a CVE ID, but the concept of uid > matching is a design change that is essentially outside the scope of > CVE. Would that be OK?  That sounds right to me.  I see uid matching as a fix for the wraparound. The default authority already restricts agents to only be able to register for subjects of matching uid.  Or to turn it around, polkit in many places matches uids, this adds another one to fix a bug with cookie handling.
