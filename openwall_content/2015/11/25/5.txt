Thanks in advance.  We have found a remote code execution vulnerability in gitlab-shell and This affects GitLab Community Edition and GitLab Enterprise Edition GitLab and earlier versions are not affected by this vulnerability.  GitLab allows users to push and pull Git data over SSH. To prevent full system access via SSH we use gitlab-shell, a program that sanitizes and validates SSH commands that run on the GitLab server to send and receive Git data. Due to a change in gitlab-shell an attacker who has a user account on a GitLab server can bypass the sanitization in gitlab-shell and run arbitrary commands on the GitLab server.  The only versions of GitLab that include a vulnerable version of gitlab-shell  are GitLab Community Edition and GitLab Enterprise Edition If you are still running GitLab 8.1 or earlier then you are not affected by this vulnerability.  As an administrator you can check your gitlab-shell version by going to gitlab.example.com/admin and looking in the upper right corner in the 'Components' section. Only gitlab-shell versions and are affected.  If you installed GitLab on your server then you should  [upgrade immediately](https://about.gitlab.com/update/).
