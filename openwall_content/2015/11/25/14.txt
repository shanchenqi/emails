Definitely things that are fully Open Sourced (e.g. upstream project, or distributions like Red Hat or Debian). If a proprietary vendor uses some OpenSource bits then I'd be interested if the upstream project also ships it, so it would go under that upstream listing. If it's stuff the proprietary vendors are adding I'm not really interested, for two reasons:  1) proprietary/closed source vendors have a long history of doing silly things, so it's a given they'll have problems here 2) the chances of getting them to fix it are low, so I'm simply not interested in spending any time/resources on it.  If you want to create a project in GitHub that covers OpenSource bits used in mostly proprietary vendors (e.g. Mac OS X) then feel free to, but again for  a multitude of reasons I'm not interested in that side of the problem.    > Gsunde >   Also as an example of what I am looking for I did an initial dump of Fedora 23 (all of it) we end up with about 83 packages containing certs/keys/etc. Some are obvious (archlinux-keyring, debian-keyring, ca-certificates, bind), some are embedded (mostly copies of the Mozilla CA cert stuff) and some need more research. If anyone wants to add notes/data to them please feel free.  https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/Certificates-Shipped/tree/master/distributions/Fedora/23   -- Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
