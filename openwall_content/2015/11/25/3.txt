It could occur while processing a chain of commands located in the Command Block List(CBL). Each Command Block(CB) points to the next command in the list. An infinite loop unfolds if the link to the next CB points to the same block or there is a closed loop in the chain.  A privileged(CAP_SYS_RAWIO) user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu instance resulting in DoS.  Upstream patch: - ---------------    ->   This issue was discovered by Qinghao Tang of QIHU Marvel Team.
