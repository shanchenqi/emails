These functions failed to check for an out-of-range palette when reading or writing PNG files with a bit_depth less than 8.  Some applications might read the bit depth from the IHDR chunk and allocate memory for a 2^N entry palette, while libpng can return a palette with up to entries even when the bit depth is less than 8.  libpng versions and were released today (12 November to fix this vulnerability.  See libpng.sourceforge.net  regards,  Glenn Randers-Pehrson libpng custodian   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
