The upstream developers have just released version which fixes all relevant issues.  A malformed XML file can cause a heap out of bounds read access in the function xmlParseXMLDecl. Upstream bug (sample input attached) Git commit / fix  A second, very similar issue in the same function xmlParseXMLDecl. Upstream bug (sample input attached) Git commit / fix  A malformed XML file can cause a global out of bounds read access in the function xmlNextChar. This only affected the git code and was never an issue in any release version. Upstream bug (sample input attached)  All three issues above were found with american fuzzy lop and address sanitizer.  Some inputs can cause a stack out of bounds read. This was found by running the test suite with Address Sanitizer (make check). The issue was re-found by fuzzing independently by Hugh Davenport: Upstream bug Upstream bug (duplicate) Git commit / fix  Unfortunately there is another issue affecting the test suite (also documented in upstream bug that isn't fixed yet, but the bug is in the code of the test itself, therefore it's not affecting the use of Libxml2.  A large number of other issues have been fixed, many of them found with american fuzzy lop and libfuzzer. The release notes of mention 10 CVEs. If you use Libxml2 please update as soon as possible. http://www.xmlsoft.org/news.html  --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
