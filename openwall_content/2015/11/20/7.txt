To protect this bridge on Android, the framework uses a BridgeSecret to protect it from third-party hijacking. However, the BridgeSecret is not sufficiently random and can be determined in certain scenarios.  Upgrade Path: Developers who are concerned about this issue should rebuild their applications with Cordova Android or later.  Version and later do not contain this vulnerability.
