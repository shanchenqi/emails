The 'reset' option in lxdm.conf controls whether X server > is restarted on session user close.  This possibly can be included in CVE but, if so, the CVE ID would be different. Is there any other information, e.g., why was there a decision to make reset an optional behavior rather than a required behavior? Is there a possible attack by a different local user, or is the relevant attack that someone could steal the computer and recover the authentication cookies (possibly violating an expectation of the legitimate user who believed they were safely logged out)? Is the behavior different from all major display managers? http://wiki.lxde.org/en/LXDM says "LXDM is the lightweight display manager ..." -- is the design tradeoff possibly different on a low-resource machine where it's very expensive to restart the X server?  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =59AY -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
