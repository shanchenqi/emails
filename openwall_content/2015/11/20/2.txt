LXDM before did not start X server with -auth parameter. Therefore any user able to connect to it (typically all local users) would have their X connections accepted.  The issue was fixed via:   LXDM also defaults to not restarting X server between sessions, and does not change authentication cookies or remove xhost authorizations. This allows local user to be able to connect to the X server after they logged out.  The 'reset' option in lxdm.conf controls whether X server is restarted on session user close.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
