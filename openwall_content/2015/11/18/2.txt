Use for the vulnerability addressed by modifying Jenkins to be safe in the presence of a problematic webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/lib/commons-collections-*.jar file.  As far as we know, "the Groovy variant in 'ysoserial'" means:    https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial/blob/master/src/main/java/ysoserial/payloads/Groovy1.java  which is a exploit. Also, we are guessing that Groovy is relevant because of:    https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Groovy+plugin  If preventing the ysoserial Groovy attack against Jenkins only involves updating the installed Groovy code to or and it has never been necessary or recommended to change any component unique to Jenkins, then we would recommend mapping to If it were necessary or recommended to change any component unique to Jenkins, then you can have an additional CVE ID for the ysoserial Groovy aspect of (Our expectation is that separate CVE IDs are needed because the Groovy plugin has own version numbering -- such as version -- that's separate from the version numbering of Jenkins core.)  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =n4BO -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
