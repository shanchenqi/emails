A server polling for data coming from a client socket may put the peer socket on a wait list.  This peer may close the connection making the reference on the wait list no longer valid. A determined attacker could poison this memory and lead to bypassing permissions on a the socket,  and packets being injected into the stream.  This may also panic the machine.
