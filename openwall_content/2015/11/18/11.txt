We updated neither commons-collections nor Groovy, the fix for both is specific to Jenkins, in the same component, and was part of the same release of Jenkins. Does this mean the one CVE ID covers both?  --  Daniel Beck   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
