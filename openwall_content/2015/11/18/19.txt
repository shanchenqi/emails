Same problem as Red Hat faces, we can't simply harvest huge amounts of customer data due to privacy and legal concerns.  We would have to rely upon the compromised users coming forth with details/forensic results, so anecdotal, self selected data at best. I know in my experience I had seifried.org hacked many years ago due to a combination of known web based vuln (which I was going to patch as soon as an update came out) and a Kernel local escalation vuln (which I was planning to patch on Monday, but it was a weekend). I also had a full SSH trust setup for all the hosts because I was super lazy, so once they got into the web host they got into all the hosts. Needless to say I don't do things like that anymore.  I know the CloudSecurityAlliance.org is working on a platform to provide anonymized information sharing of incidents/attacks, and various other organizations like Infragard have similar programs setup, maybe we can ask nicely for meta data from them.  Another alternative is to setup enough honeypots that we get meaningful data, but again this would be self selecting to some degree as we wouldn't see as many APT attacks.  -- Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF Red Hat Product Security contact: secalert@...hat.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
