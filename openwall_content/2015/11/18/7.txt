You do need to use it everywhere to truly take advantage of it though. It might still protect the function pointers reachable by the attacker without full coverage but... that's not at all ideal.  Mitigations like this aren't comparable to ones providing incomplete detection of memory corruption like _FORTIFY_SOURCE where even a small amount of coverage can end up preventing vulnerabilities from being exploited. A ROP migitation is only removing an exploitation technique / making exploitation unreliable (hopefully enough that it can't be brute forced) / requiring additional bugs to work around it so... it's no good if there are easy ways around it for an attacker. It actually has to enforce something meaningful.  RAP is essentially breaking the exploitation technique across the board. It's not insurmountable but it's not incomplete either. And it can be improved from the meaningful starting point. It's really hard to see how removing all usable ROP gadgets can succeed. Maybe it can, but it's hard to believe without seeing a compelling roadmap.
