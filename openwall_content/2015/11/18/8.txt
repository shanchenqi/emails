Unfortunately, you were on the moderation bypass list (not anymore).  http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security#list-content-guidelines  "Please don't post conference CFPs, (e-)magazine calls for articles, and survey questionnaires.  (These are generally cross-posted to lots of places, and oss-security list members have expressed that they do not want to see them here.)"  I am posting this publicly to indicate that the policy is still in effect, and to discourage further CFPs being sent to oss-security.  Relevant conference announcements may, with some limitations, be posted to full-disclosure:  https://secwiki.org/w/FD_Moderation#Conference_Announcements  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
