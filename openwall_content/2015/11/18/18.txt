However, creating a separate hash negatively affects the performance, without providing much benefit. Note that since there are preferable hash algorithms to MD5 that are more secure, a separate change is being proposed to allow for the configuring of this hash algorithm. This will not be included as a part of this change, in the interest of having a straightforward initial implementation." If so, then we think vendors typically wouldn't want CVEs in these types of situations, unless the intermediate step actually made something worse than before the feature development started.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =eUaC -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
