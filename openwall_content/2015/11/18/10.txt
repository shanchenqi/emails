There was an independent discovery earlier this year, tracked in [1]. Even earlier discoveries ([2,3]) missed the connection to AF_UNIX. [1] eventually lead to the incomplete patch [4] and, after multiple non-public ineffective attempts on fixing the issue, to the netdev posting [5]. That's where Jason and Rainer started to post patches fixing the issue. However, none of the patches has been applied yet.
