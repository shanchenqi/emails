The description above -- especially the 'supposed to be "atomic"' comment -- suggests that the code is unambiguously wrong, but the commit message presents the issue differently. Also, it appears that introducing '/' characters into strings is a general problem for any program that prohibits only '/' characters in user-supplied filenames (e.g., because the program, for whatever reason, can only be used on UNIX platforms). Is there a rationale for not considering this a CHICKEN vulnerability?  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =u0rD -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
