The build chain of ROPgadget is pretty "stupid", we search a series of patterns [1] which would allow us to build our payload. If these patterns are not present we don't build the payload. Then, we don't search through others libraries. That's why you got a small list. The best way to build a ROP-chain automatically, is to build the chain from the instruction semantics (take a look from slide 53 to 62 of this lecture [2]).  > But I think ASLR would make too many > moving parts for that to be practical.

So true :).
