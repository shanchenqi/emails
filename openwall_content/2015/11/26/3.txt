A call to the function read_line didn't consider a trailing zero byte in the target buffer and thus could cause a one byte stack overflow with a zero byte. This issue was already fixed in the testing code when I reported it, but the fix wasn't backported to stable yet. Git commit / fix Minimal PoC file  A second almost identical stack overflow due to a call to the function read_line was in the same file. Minimal PoC file  These issues got the id  A stack out of bounds read can happen in the function dpkg_ar_normalize_name. There is a read access to an array where the index can have the value -1. A check if the index is a positive value fixes this. https://crashes.fuzzing-project.org/dpkg-stack-oob-read-dpkg_ar_normalize_name.deb Minimal PoC file  All issues were found with the help of american fuzzy lop and address sanitizer.  Debian has published the advisory DSA Fixes packages for both stable (Jessie) and oldstable (Wheezy) have been published.  Ubuntu has published the advisory Fixed packages for Ubuntu and the LTS versions and have been published.  All users of Ubuntu, Debian and other dpkg/apt-based distributions should update.  --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
