It could potentially lead to arbitrary  code execution on the host, with privileges of the Qemu process. It requires  the guest NIC to have larger MTU limit.  A remote user could use this flaw to crash the guest instance resulting in DoS  or potentially execute arbitrary code on a remote host with privileges of the  Qemu process.
