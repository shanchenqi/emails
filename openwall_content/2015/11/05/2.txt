Is there a documented policy that a privilege boundary is crossed in all cases where a printk can be triggered by an unprivileged user, or cases where the number of printk calls is somehow "too many" or the required circumstances happen "too often"?  We'd like to avoid a situation where a CVE ID is needed every time that a kernel patch exists that changes a printk to a pr_warn_ratelimited (regardless of whether the patch is ultimately added to the stable kernel).  We feel it's more reasonable to have a CVE ID in a case where code is intended to have the functionality of printing something (with a rate limit), but the functionality is broken because of an inadvertent coding error, or because of a divergence between a distribution kernel and upstream, e.g., something like       but where a pr_warn_ratelimited was supposed to alert a system administrator about an attack.  (Also, mentions "I think maybe the reason no one has noticed is due to the low usage of ratelimiting - from what I counted there were only a handful of pr_warn_ratelimit calls, and most were in nfs.")  An example similar to the current one apparently does not have a CVE:     People have proposed putting pr_warn_ratelimited into the nfs4_schedule_state_manager function in the http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/fs/nfs/nfs4state.c file, but that hasn't happened:     discusses configuration options, suggesting that the security enhancement of putting in a pr_warn_ratelimited is not needed on all machines.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  ePT+hfNc9OOcnG4jyJUW =L5+e -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
