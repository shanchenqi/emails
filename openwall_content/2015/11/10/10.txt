When an incoming EAP-pwd message is fragmented, the remaining reassembly buffer length was not checked for the last fragment (but was checked for other fragments). This allowed a suitably constructed last fragment frame to try to add extra data that would go beyond the buffer. The length validation code in wpabuf_put_data() prevents an actual buffer write overflow from occurring, but this results in process termination.  For hostapd used with an internal EAP server and EAP-pwd enabled in the runtime configuration, this could allow a denial of service attack by an attacker within radio range of the AP device.  For hostapd used as a RADIUS server with EAP-pwd enabled in the runtime configuration, this could allow a denial of service attack by an attacker within radio range of any AP device that is authorized to use the RADIUS server.  For wpa_supplicant with EAP-pwd enabled in a network configuration profile, this could allow a denial of service attack by an attacker within radio range.   Vulnerable versions/configurations  hostapd with CONFIG_EAP_PWD=y in the build configuration (hostapd/.config) and EAP-pwd authentication server enabled in runtime configuration.  wpa_supplicant with CONFIG_EAP_PWD=y in the build configuration (wpa_supplicant/.config) and EAP-pwd enabled in a network profile at runtime.   Possible mitigation steps  - Merge the following commits and rebuild hostapd/wpa_supplicant:    EAP-pwd peer: Fix last fragment length validation   EAP-pwd server: Fix last fragment length validation    These patches are available from  - Update to hostapd/wpa_supplicant v2.6 or newer, once available  - Remove CONFIG_EAP_PWD=y from build configuration  - Disable EAP-pwd in runtime configuration  --  Jouni Malinen                                            PGP id  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
