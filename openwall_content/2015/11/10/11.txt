If an EAP-pwd Confirm message is received unexpectedly before the Identity exchange, the error path processing ended up dereferencing a NULL pointer and terminating the process.  For wpa_supplicant with EAP-pwd enabled in a network configuration profile, this could allow a denial of service attack by an attacker within radio range.   Vulnerable versions/configurations  wpa_supplicant with CONFIG_EAP_PWD=y in the build configuration (wpa_supplicant/.config) and EAP-pwd enabled in a network profile at runtime.   Possible mitigation steps  - Merge the following commits and rebuild wpa_supplicant:    EAP-pwd peer: Fix error path for unexpected Confirm message    This patch is available from  - Update to wpa_supplicant v2.6 or newer, once available  - Remove CONFIG_EAP_PWD=y from build configuration  - Disable EAP-pwd in runtime configuration  --  Jouni Malinen                                            PGP id  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
