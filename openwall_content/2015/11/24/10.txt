In some cases, there can be a CVE ID when documentation indicates an unsafe way to use a product, and a CVE ID for documentation would typically be separate from a CVE ID for code. Here, however, there is no CVE ID for the documentation change. We feel that a reader's most likely interpretation of those lines was simply that configuration was possible, not that it was a good configuration for a multi-user system. In general, it seems that a CVE ID for documentation would be more useful if a documented usage example were dangerous in an unexpected or subtle way.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  yWF6xKDli3IDwDGl+pbr =Nw8v -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
