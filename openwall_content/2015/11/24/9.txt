Further issues have been found or are suspected which would also (or exclusively) affect AMD CPUs.  We believe that the functionality is mostly intended for non-production use anyway.  Therefore this functionality is hereby documented as generally unsupported security-wise.  IMPACT ======  Use of the feature may have unknown effects, ranging from information leaks through Denial of Service to privilege escalation.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Only systems which enable the VPMU feature are affected.  That is, only systems with a `vpmu' setting on the hypervisor command line.  Xen versions from 3.3 onwards are affected.  Only x86 systems are affected.  ARM systems do not currently implement vPMU and are therefore currently unaffected; should this functionality be added to ARM in the future it would be covered by this exclusion.  In Xen versions prior to 4.6 only HVM guests can take advantage of this unsupported functionality.  In Xen versions from 4.6 onwards all guest kinds can use this unsupported functionality.  MITIGATION ==========  Not enabling vPMU support (by omitting the "vpmu" hypervisor command line option) will avoid using and exposing the unsupported functionality.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached patch documents the situation.  The patch does not fix any security issues.            xen-unstable  $  $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =2Wqz -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
