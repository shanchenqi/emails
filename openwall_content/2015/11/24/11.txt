The exceptions were not caught and handled, so a remote unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to perform a denial-of-service attack against an ONOS system.  To exploit this issue, the attacker must be able to send a jumbo ethernet frame to a switch controlled by ONOS. Only the connection between the controller and the switch generating the packet-in message of the malicious packet will be affected (disconnected).

A request was sent to MITRE directly 9 days ago with no answer. We need a CVE ID within the next 24 hours.
