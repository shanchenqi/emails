This issue was fixed in 1.6 with the following commit:   Upstream Changelog: https://metacpan.org/source/MRASH/IPTables-Parse-1.6/Changes > (Miloslav TrmaÄ) Fixed a vulnerability to not use predictable names > for temporary files. This vulnerability would allow an attacker on a > multi- user system to set up symlinks to overwrite any file the > current user has write access to. If a user manually overrides the > temporary file locations with the 'iptout' and 'ipterr' hash keys, > it is recommended to not use predictable names either.  Can a CVE be assigned for this issue?
