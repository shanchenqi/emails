Fuzzing the pcretest tool uncovered an input leading to a heap overflow in the function pcre_exec. This bug was found with the help of american fuzzy lop and address sanitizer. Upstream bug (PoC and ASAN trace attached there)  This is fixed in PCRE There are two variants of PCRE, the classic one and PCRE2. PCRE2 is not affected.  Appart from that a couple of other vulnerabilities found by other people have been fixed in this release: Heap overflow in compile_regex Stack overflow in compile_regex Heap overflow in compile_regex  If you use PCRE to parse untrusted inputs you should update immediately.   --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
