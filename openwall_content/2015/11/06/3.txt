This stored XSS was in a component (the built-in webserver) that 1) is disabled by default 2) should only be opened up on a non-public network (or with    authentications in front) 3) serves a simple read-only webpage  To 'exploit' this XSS, someone with knowledge of the target's infrastructure must send the target a malicious link (with the exploit code embedded in the link). As this is built-in webpage is (should) only accessible to the operators of the DNS server, the attack-surface for this attack is very low.  We consider this XSS a very low risk vulnerability because of this and suggest a CVE be not assigned.  --  Pieter Lexis PowerDNS.COM BV - https://www.powerdns.com   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
