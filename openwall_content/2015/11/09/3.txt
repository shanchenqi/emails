This bug, when exploited, causes an assertion error and consequent termination of the the `pdns_server` process, causing a Denial of Service.  When the PowerDNS Authoritative Server is run inside the guardian (`--guardian`), or inside a supervisor like supervisord or systemd, it will be automatically restarted, limiting the impact to a somewhat degraded service.  PowerDNS Authoritative Server - are affected. No other versions are affected. The PowerDNS Recursor is not affected.  PowerDNS Authoritative Server contains a fix to this issue. A minimal patch is available [2].  This issue is unrelated to the issues in our previous two Security Announcements and  We'd like to thank Christian Hofstaedtler of Deduktiva GmbH for finding and reporting this issue.  1 - 2 - - --  Pieter Lexis PowerDNS.COM BV -- https://www.powerdns.com -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v2  =OUeD -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
