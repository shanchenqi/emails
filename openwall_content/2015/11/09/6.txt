After installing the net-snmp package, I noticed there is a security problem.  By default the permissions of the snmpd configuration file are instead of    # cd /usr/ports/net/net-snmp   # make install clean   ===>  Installing from   ok   The following new rcscripts were installed: /etc/rc.d/netsnmpd /etc/rc.d/netsnmptrapd   See rcctl(8) for details.   ===>  Cleaning for   # ls -latr /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf   -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  Nov  4 /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf   #    # uname -ap   OpenBSD foo.my.domain 5.8   #   The same problem occurs when the provided package is installed with `pkg_add    # ls -latr /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf   -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  Nov  4 /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf   #  The snmpd configuration file is readable by a local user and contains the credentials for read-only and read-write access (for SNMPv1, SNMPv2 and SNMPv3 protocols) and gives a local user unnecessary/dangerous access:    [...]    rocommunity public  default    -V systemonly   #rocommunity secret    rouser   authOnlyUser   #rwuser   authPrivUser   priv    [...]  Futhermore, by default, `/usr/local/sbin/snmpd` runs as root.  This problem is OpenBSD-specific as the file confirms:   @ts   @sample /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf    Stuart Henderson, the OpenBSD package maintainer, confirmed the problem and stated that the permissions for the configuration file (/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf) are now fixed in -current and -stable.  This issue was openbsd-specific and affected the net-snmp package/port for years.
