This is not a vulnerability in the library.  How can this feature allow remote code execution if it does not involve any networking at all?  The root cause is the incorrect use of Java deserialization.  As long as you do not fix that, something else on the classpath will serve the role of Apache Commons Collections.  Disabling InvokerTransformer deserialization may be a prudent hardening measure, but calling the existing behavior a vulnerability is a bit of a stretch.
