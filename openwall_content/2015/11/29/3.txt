"pcre_compile.cpp" in might indicate that Adobe has a fork. http://vcs.pcre.org/pcre/code/trunk/ has the pcre_compile.c filename, and http://vcs.pcre.org/pcre2/code/trunk/src/ has the pcre2_compile.c filename.  JavaScript may be "something else" in most cases, e.g.,      https://github.com/v8/v8/tree/master/src/regexp   https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/js/src/irregexp  We haven't looked at whether there are ever attack vectors associated with untrusted Lua code, e.g., if the Lua code can make use of something like https://github.com/rrthomas/lrexlib to reach vulnerable code found in the system's libpcre package.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =hUsw -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
