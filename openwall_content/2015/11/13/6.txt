An out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in USBVision USB Camera Driver in usbvision_probe() function in drivers/media/usb/usbvision/usbvision-video.c. The driver assumes that the interfaces numbers of the USB device are always in order. By using a specially crafted USB device which advertises out-of-order number on one of its interfaces an unprivileged user with a physical access can trigger a kernel NULL pointer dereference causing the system to freeze.  Currently there is an effort to create an upstream patch for this driver fixing this issue.
