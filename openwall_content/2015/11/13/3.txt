I agree, and Florian stated similar concerns already in the beginning of this thread [1]. However, what the functors package does seems to be very easily to exploit through untrusted input. So the "bug" I would assign to Commons-Collections is that it allows deserialization by default while it shouldn't by default.  >  >> So people (esp.

A property that re-enables deserialization of course would help additionally: allow applications that really *need* this to get it working; but that requires an explicit step - so latest by that time: those, whose applications break after including a "fixed" version of Commons-Collections would (hopefully) start to think about their design.
