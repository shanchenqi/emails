I propose to use the same ID here. This is btw. the only critical bug without a CVE-ID included in latest Jenkins release [2].

Full details of the vulnerability can be found in this recent blog post, [1]. A proposed patch for 3.2.x branch has been submitted upstream, but no release has been made with the fix at the current time. The issue affects version 3.x, and 4.x of Apache common-collections, [2]. >  >    [1] >    [2] >  > Regards, > Jason Shepherd > Red Hat Product Security >    Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
