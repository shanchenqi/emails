If it is not, then this is off-topic for oss-security.  Google web search for did not find anything, suggesting the code in question has not been published.  A maybe-relevant detail is that if this is a Linux kernel patch, then the code must be made public per the GPL.  It is unclear whether this makes the vulnerability detail on-topic for oss-security or not yet (maybe not until the code is actually published).  I think it's the first time an issue like this (in code that is meant to be published, but is not yet) is brought up in here (although I might have missed other examples - e.g., maybe the joke postings about a North Korean Linux distro would also fall under this category).
