Upstream bug  In the case of a widely used library, a vulnerability in git code, without an affected upstream release, can sometimes have a CVE ID. However, it would be necessary to establish that a product used the vulnerable code. For example, at least in the past, one of the principal libxml2 users was Chrome. At present, it seems that Chromium is using parserInternals.c from not from unreleased git code (download https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/third_party/libxml/src/parserInternals.c?format=TEXT and then base64 decode that and compare it to the file). Our guess is that it is unlikely that this specific xmlNextChar vulnerability affected a product; we are not planning to research this, but other people can research it if they wish.
