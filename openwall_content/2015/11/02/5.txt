The vendor's report is listed under "security advisories" on the http://w1.fi/security page, and it may be reasonable to interpret "hostapd/wpa_supplicant should have (re)confirmed NDEF message validity properly" to mean "hostapd/wpa_supplicant had a vulnerability because they did not (re)confirm NDEF message validity properly." In other words, although the issue is not exploitable with any known NFC implementation, the hostapd/wpa_supplicant design goal was to operate safely even if validation were missing in an NFC implementation.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  ZI+SbA6QMEGzq5oflWtIrijLif/YcevYyIlVJyDQjXrnvL/+g/ZfegnWruaJjWaU GDmrNOp6JAhzg1+xMggO =1n9O -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
