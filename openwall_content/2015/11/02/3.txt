The tool is fully open source (GPLv2), and I'm using it for testing  OpenSSL, NSS and GnuTLS. It has minimal requirements (just Python 2.6 or  3.2 or later).  You can find slides from my latest presentation at Ruxcon 11, showing  some reasons for creating this tool as well as showing some of the  features it has here:  You can find the project itself here: https://github.com/tomato42/tlsfuzzer  Please direct responses at my email address as I'm not subscribed to  list. --  Regards, Hubert Kario Senior Quality Engineer, QE BaseOS Security team Web: www.cz.redhat.com Red Hat Czech s.r.o., PurkyĹova 45, Brno, Czech Republic Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
