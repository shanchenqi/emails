Just because the first iteration of a technology isn't perfect, or the ideas have room for improvement is no reason to go all negative.  Sometimes great ideas start out like this. If it's a bad idea, it won't stick around for long. There are few instances where doing nothing is better than doing something.  --      JB  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
