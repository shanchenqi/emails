A possible exception to the latter is "mplayer -slave" but, in that situation, it appears that an attack would not cross privilege boundaries. If the attacker is able to send slave commands, and wants to kill the mplayer process, they can send a "quit" command (or, with slightly more complexity, a "run" command).  > Upstream is notified.  A CVE ID may be available if the upstream response indicates that the out-of-bounds reads allow the attacker to change the flow of control.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =xO57 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
