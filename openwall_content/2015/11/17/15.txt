It needs to provide something meaningful to be a layer. There is a performance and complexity budget too. Landing a security feature should involve explaining the threat model and the plan to fully address it. It can be a very narrow threat model, sure. SSP is an example of a feature with *very* narrow threat model and a very high performance cost for what it actually accomplishes and yet it's still quite useful (but it could be replaced with something much better).  It's not going to be increasing the cost of exploit development if it only means a script ends up finding different gadgets instead. Maybe it leads to better tooling being developed if it's far enough along, but that's one person investing their time once, not every exploit taking more resources to develop. If it's incomplete, how is it a layer?
