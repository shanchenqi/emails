The bug allows one to request arbitrary files due to a problem in the handling of backslashes in URI path components.  In principle, the bug only affects Windows, but unfortunately due to another bug in CHICKEN core that causes backslashes to be converted to slashes, *nix platforms are equally affected.  A workaround to simply block all requests containing backslashes in path components has been implemented in Spiffy 5.4, and a proper solution (allowing backslashes on UNIX in CHICKEN versions where it's safe to do so) will be implemented in a later version, pending the fix in CHICKEN core.  In other words, the bug applies to all versions of Spiffy prior to 5.4.
