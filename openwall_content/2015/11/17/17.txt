In order to ensure full traceability, we need a CVE number assigned that we can attach to further notifications. This issue is already public, although an advisory was not sent yet.  Title: Use of MD5 in OpenStack Glance image signature Reporter: Daniel P. Berrange (Red Hat) Products: Glance Affects:  Description: Daniel P. Berrange from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Glance image signature. Glance computes cryptographic signature using MD5 hash of the image. By crafting a malicious image that produces a MD5 collision, a Glance backend operator may subvert the signature verification process, resulting in a corrupted image. All Glance setups are affected.
