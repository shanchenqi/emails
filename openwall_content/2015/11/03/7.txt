Actually, yes, a CVE was assigned a while ago:  We realize that the www.nemux.org URL says "09 Oct Mitre.org contacted (no response)"; however, we actually did respond on that day. (The person who wanted a CVE ID wrote to us from two e-mail addresses, one of which did not work for us. The person wrote to us a few weeks ago confirming that they did receive the CVE ID. We will follow up.)  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =j8S/ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
