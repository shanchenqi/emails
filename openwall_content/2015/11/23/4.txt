The attacker could hereby circumvent firewall restrictions. Mitigation: 4.7.x users should upgrade to Example: For XML object containing the following string representation:  <!DOCTYPE foo PUBLIC "-//VSR//PENTEST//EN" "http://protected-server/protected-service"><foo>Some content</foo> The server could access the url: http://protected-server/protected-service  Even if directly accessing this resource is prevented by firewall rules.
