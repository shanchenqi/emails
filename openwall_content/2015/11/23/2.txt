It was reported that there are some exit paths in ext4_fill_super() which result in destruction of workqueue which is not yet initialized, leading to kernel NULL pointer dereference. A privileged user with permission to mount a filesystem or anybody having physical access to the system's USB port and prepared filesystem on USB disk which will be automatically mounted can cause system panic and thus DoS.
