The post identified one commit associated with an upstream security-fix release, but it was later found that there were two similar commits associated with the same type of security fix in that release. The oss-security thread was extremely helpful in providing a specific URL for where upstream discussion was attempted, but the only upstream discussion occurred after the last oss-security message. Finally, there is the somewhat-common question of what to do if a Linux distributor interprets an oss-security message as an indication that a new distribution package can be safely produced by backporting one commit, rather than by packaging a new upstream version.  The scope of is both of the June commits by the cyrus-imapd developers for preventing read operations that go beyond the size of a message, i.e.,       and     (We don't know of cases where a Linux distribution backported only For example, the September updates from openSUSE state that they packaged version If any Linux distributions backported only each of those distributions should now have another unique CVE for an "incomplete fix for problem. If we already knew that that had occurred, we may have chosen separate CVEs for the upstream and fixes, to simplify the overall CVE assignment work.)  The original oss-security message suggested that the fixed version was but actually all of these changelogs seem applicable:         The scope of is the discovery by Florian Weimer that there can be an integer overflow in the start_octet addition after the fix. This discovery corresponds to:     The scope of is the discovery by a cyrus-imapd developer that there can be an integer overflow in the section_offset addition after the fix. This discovery corresponds to:     and potentially affect all released versions (see the ftp://ftp.cyrusimap.org/cyrus-imapd/ listing.)  There is no CVE for the buffer overflow because we don't know of a realistic case in which a privilege boundary can be crossed by an untrusted person who controls the imtest command line.  There is no CVE for because of the upstream comments in the post.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  ZnWm8ntzkESdiXorQIE2 =utTo -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
