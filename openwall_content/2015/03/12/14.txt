The scope of this CVE does not include the original input string for a %i argument. As far as we can tell, Bug doesn't resolve the question of whether a crash is a permitted behavior for that input. It seems that the relevant standards perhaps should have specified that that results in an ERANGE error without a crash, but the published wordings are not precise enough to determine whether unexpected handling is a vulnerability.  Similarly, the scope of this CVE certainly does not include "string conversions that overflow the destination buffer" in the comment. In that case, undefined behavior is the documented outcome, so we feel that there isn't a vulnerability.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =RpzJ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
