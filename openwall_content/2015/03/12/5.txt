Sure thing, test for it then if you like.  Just install an expired cert on a test server and connect.  But if I logged it against a RedHat product, I'd put it as a bug, not security issue.  >>> What about a certificate signed for the correct hostname by a system >>> trusted CA?

Ok, but if somebody's implemented this feature they've gone well beying the point of not verifying certificates at all, which is what pretty much every program I tested that ships with RHEL did until I logged bugs against them.  Apache still doesn't validate certificates for backend connections in RHEL (mod_proxy).  > Uhm. Did you not look at any of the cve.mitre.org links I sent? These > are incredibly common failures.

If you think they're common, ask your dev teams test for them before shipping.  > Anyways I think we're sufficiently off topic now.  I think this is an important discussion to have, and I don't think we're at all off topic (for the list or thread).  I know TLS is hard, but we don't have to default to snake-oil bad.
