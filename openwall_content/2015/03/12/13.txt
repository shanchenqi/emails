Use The "If the https is used to transfer the cookie" text in the commit seems somewhat confusing. As far as we can tell, the new code does not mean that the server looks for cookie transmission over https and then decides to use the secure attribute. Instead, the new code seems to have the "normal" behavior in which the server sets the secure attribute upon any use of an https session by the client.  In other words, there isn't an incomplete fix in which the first cookie transmission over https lacks the secure attribute.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =rp9s -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
