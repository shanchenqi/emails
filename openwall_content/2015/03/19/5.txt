Open redirect (Several vectors including the "destination" URL parameter - Drupal 6 and 7) Under certain circumstances, malicious users can use the destination URL parameter to construct a URL that will trick users into being redirected to a 3rd party website, thereby exposing the users to potential social engineering attacks.
