For example in a case where a security issue is obvious (a PHP app with XSS due to missing htmlspecialchars for example) and well documented (link to a github commit or similar) could Mitre just assigns the CVE, link it to the gihub commit or whatever the original source is and it never give it a "real" description? Most of these types of issues just need CVEs and an entry in the database with the source, I don't think anyone cares much beyond that.  --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
