Yup, I am aware of that, but as you know Red Hat is pretty conservative on updates to things like Python/etc because we have to support customer applications that we have never seen and will never see (e.g. internal corp software), and if we break those apps due to changes in underlying languages there is a big problem.  > --- > Donald Stufft > PGP: 7C6B 7C5D 5E2B F04F 6E3C BCE9 DCFA >   --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
