Yes, there was -- the comment in the bug report does not take into account the fact that the open-ils.pcrud endpoint supports anonymous, unauthenticated retrieval of database objects under pcrud's purview if a user permission for retrieval is not explicitly specified in fm_IDL.xml.  >  - in version there is a major vulnerability in which a >    setting's history can be viewed by any authenticated user, >    including users with the "patron" role  Almost -- per my response above, unauthenticated users could also gain access to a setting's history as, prior to the patch, anonymous retrieval was possible via open-ils.pcrud.  >  - in version there is a minor vulnerability in which a >    setting's history can be viewed by all persons with the staff role, >    which would include unauthorized staff in many realistic >    deployments.

Correct, and I agree with the implication that bug would therefore warrant two CVE numbers.
