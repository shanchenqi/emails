Does this mean that:   - in version there is a major vulnerability in which a    setting's history can be viewed by any authenticated user,    including users with the "patron" role   - in version there is a minor vulnerability in which a    setting's history can be viewed by all persons with the staff role,    which would include unauthorized staff in many realistic    deployments. This might be fixed in a future release by forcing all    access to use cstore, or by some other undetermined change.  ?  >  This seems to be a much simpler case that was completely fixed by and had allowed unauthenticated access. It will have only one CVE ID.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =3sHe -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
