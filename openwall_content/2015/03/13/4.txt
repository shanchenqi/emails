The original patches had the permissions check backwards, meaning that a guest could read a write-only mapping and vice versa, rendering the original fix ineffective an inparticular not closing down the ability for a guest to write to a readonly page via the hypervisor.  This issue was discussed on a public IRC channel and therefore it has been agreed with the discoverer that it should not subject to a new embargo.  32-bit ARM systems are not affected by this mistake; the original fix remains correct for 32-bit.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  When accessing guest memory Xen does not correctly perform permissions checks on the (possibly guest provided) virtual address: it only checks that the mapping is readable by the guest, even when writing on behalf of the guest.  This allows a guest to write to memory which it should only be able to read.  A guest running on a vulnerable system is able to write to memory which should be read-only.  This includes supposedly read only foreign mappings established using the grant table mechanism.  Such read-only mappings are commonly used as part of the paravirtualised I/O drivers (such as guest disk write and network transmit).  In order to exploit this vulnerability the guest must have a mapping of the memory; it does not allow access to arbitrary addresses.  In the event that a guest executes code from a page which has been shared read-only with another guest it would be possible to mount a take over attack on that guest.  IMPACT ======  A domain which is deliberately exchanging data with another, malicious, domain, may be vulnerable to privilege escalation.  The vulnerability depends on the precise behaviour of the victim domain.  In a typical configuration this means that, depending on the behaviour of the toolstack or device driver domain, a malicious guest administrator might be able to escalate their privilege to that of the whole host.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Both 32- and 64-bit ARM systems are vulnerable from Xen 4.4 onward.  MITIGATION ==========  None.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Julien Grall.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate pair of attached patches along with the additional update resolves this issue.         xen-unstable             Xen 4.4.x xsa98-update.patch                  Additional update for both unstable and 4.4  $ xsa98*.patch      xsa98-update.patch $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =slo3 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment "xsa98-update.patch" of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
