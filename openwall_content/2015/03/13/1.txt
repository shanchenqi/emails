With the release of Android 5.0, Android has removed support for non-PIE binaries [1] [2]. Attempting to run a non-PIE binary will generate an error on Android. In this way, we ensure that all binaries take full advantage of Android's ASLR implementation.  This is just one of the many security enhancements added in Android 5.*, and one that I hope other Linux distributions will pick up.
