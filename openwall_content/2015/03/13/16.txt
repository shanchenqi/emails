Also there's a large embedded market for Linux that is also interested in stability/being boring.  > And if you are a company that is ignoring stable kernel patches for > their old kernel releases, well, that's just not very wise :)  See the funny thing is we're not ignoring them. We're identifying and backporting the important ones, like security fixes. But as you know Kernel patch volume is quite high and not all patches are properly labelled as important or security by upstream, which leads to:  > What does asking for a CVE for such an old issue help with?  So we can more easily identify the security related vulnerabilities and patches and provide updates for customers.  This is why it's important to get CVE's onto security issues as soon as possible. Then we don't have a bunch of random/old issues to deal with at some point in the future. Aka why I unembargoed all our old cruft and cleaned house.  #nomoresecretflaws  > thanks, >  > greg k-h >   --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
