Every app and many services are spawned from an initial zygote process without an exec, so nearly everything has the same ASLR bases. It is great to see progress in this space though. I hope to see the zygote process go away now that ART and modern hardware makes it much less necessary - especially if a process (or a pool) is pre-spawned during idle time.  AFAIK, the change forbidding non-PIE binaries was backed out for the official 5.0 release I guess that was fixed in 5.1? I haven't looked into it yet.  > I brought this to Twitter, and here's a comment by Rich Felker: >  > <solardiz> Android 5.0 "has removed support for non-PIE binaries.

The final emacs binary is a dump of an emacs with a lisp heap full of pointers and no relocation data.  FWIW, I think various distributions are going to enable it once the PIE by default patches land:   There has been no luck getting someone to review them, so they missed the GCC 5 freeze deadline despite being ready before then.  I proposed that we enable it by default on Arch via wrapper scripts, but it was rejected in favour of waiting for this patch to land. An OpenSUSE developer also voiced interest in the patches on the GCC mailing list. It just needs a committer who feels like reviewing it.
