Usually, it's us who complain about certain upstreams who say that they have fixed some vulnerabilities in a new release (along with tons of other fixes), list a few CVEs, but without any details what was actually fixed.  In any case, my immediate need for this information is gone.  Debian jessie will not release with the docker.io package.  (Previously, it was at version which is why I was a bit concerned.)
