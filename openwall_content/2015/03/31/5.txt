Public release.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The XEN_DOMCTL_memory_mapping hypercall allows long running operations without implementing preemption.  This hypercall is used by the device model as part of the emulation associated with configuration of PCI devices passed through to HVM guests and is therefore indirectly exposed to those guests.  This can cause a physical CPU to become busy for a significant period, leading to a host denial of service in some cases.  If a host denial of service is not triggered then it may instead be possible to deny service to the domain running the device model, e.g. domain 0.  This hypercall is also exposed more generally to all toolstacks. However the uses of it in libxl based toolstacks are not believed to open up any avenue of attack from an untrusted guest. Other toolstacks may be vulnerable however.  IMPACT ======  The vulnerability is exposed via HVM guests which have a PCI device assigned to them. A malicious HVM guest in such a configuration can mount a denial of service attack affecting the whole system via its associated device model (qemu-dm).  A guest is able to trigger this hypercall via operations which it is legitimately expected to perform, therefore running the device model as a stub domain does not offer protection against the host denial of service issue. However it does offer some protection against secondary issues such as denial of service against dom0.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  The issue is exposed via x86 HVM VMs which have been assigned a PCI device.  x86 PV domains, x86 HVM domains without passthrough devices and ARM domains do not expose this vulnerability.  Xen 3.2.x and later are vulnerable. Xen 3.1.x and earlier have not been inspected.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only PV guests will avoid this issue.  This issue can be avoided by not assigning devices with large MMIO regions to untrusted HVM guests.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk of Oracle.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.                  Xen 4.5.x, xen-unstable             Xen 4.4.x             Xen 4.3.x             Xen 4.2.x  $     $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
