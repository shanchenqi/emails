ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  HVM guests are currently permitted to modify the memory and I/O decode bits in the PCI command register of devices passed through to them. Unless the device is an SR-IOV virtual function, after disabling one or both of these bits subsequent accesses to the MMIO or I/O port ranges would - on PCI Express devices - lead to Unsupported Request responses. The treatment of such errors is platform specific.  Furthermore (at least) devices under control of the Linux pciback driver in the host are handed to guests with the aforementioned bits turned off.  This means that such accesses can similarly lead to Unsupported Request responses until these flags are set as needed by the guest.  IMPACT ======  In the event that the platform surfaces aforementioned UR responses as Non-Maskable Interrupts, and either the OS is configured to treat NMIs as fatal or (e.g. via ACPI's APEI) the platform tells the OS to treat these errors as fatal, the host would crash, leading to a Denial of Service.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen versions 3.3 and onwards are vulnerable due to supporting PCI pass-through.  Only x86 systems are vulnerable.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.  Only HVM guests with their device model run in Dom0 can take advantage of this vulnerability.  Any domain which is given access to a non-SR-IOV virtual function PCI Express device can take advantage of this vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  This issue can be avoided by not assigning PCI Express devices other than SR-IOV virtual functions to untrusted HVM guests.  This issue can also be avoided by only using PV guests or HVM guests with their device model run in a separate (stub) domain.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            qemu-upstream-unstable, Xen 4.5.x, Xen 4.4.x       qemu-upstream-unstable, Xen 4.3.x           qemu-xen-unstable, Xen 4.5.x, Xen 4.4.x, Xen 4.3.x, Xen 4.2.x  For those already having the original patch in place, applying the appropriate attached incremental patch addresses the regression.       qemu-upstream-unstable, Xen 4.5.x, Xen 4.4.x  qemu-upstream-unstable, Xen 4.3.x      qemu-xen-unstable, Xen 4.5.x, Xen 4.4.x, Xen 4.3.x, Xen 4.2.x  $       $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
