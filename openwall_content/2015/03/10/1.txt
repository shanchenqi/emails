This would be HUGELY helpful to the community.  I have no link to MySQL.

I would really like to be able to do that, but this is a political problem outside my control.  We, the linux team, already contribute not inconsiderable amounts to the community: we're a big contributor to xen, to parts of the linux kernel including btrfs, ocfs2 (obviously), nfs ... the MAINTAINERS file lists 13 maintainers with @oracle.com maintainers.   It wouldn't take a lot of searching to find our contributions to numerous other projects.  None of this, however, has anything to do with the matter at hand.  If no one from Red Hat is unwilling to cooperate in getting a single backward-compatible resolution to incorporating into the distro python versions then perhaps someone else is.  If there's interest, I'll gladly work with anyone who wants to find a way to do this.   This is just me trying, as usual, to do the best by everyone.  I don't speak for Oracle, I'm not paid enough for that, I'm just trying to make sure that we don't wind up with a backported fix that makes the overall situation worse.  So can we please set aside the anti-corporate sentiments? jch -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =mKaH -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
