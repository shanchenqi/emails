I'm happy to help work on this.  The two ways to attack this seem to be:  1) Use alternatives for the ssl module, and a new package has a higher priority version of the module.  2) Include both versions of the module under different names, and have a script that symlinks the correct one in place.  This may work better in chroot environments, etc.  Regards,   Michael  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
