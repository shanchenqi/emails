Individual applications that want to behave correctly can use the new module.   Existing applications can use the old module (by default) or the new module (if alternatives is configured that way).  That way existing applications that depend on the old broken behaviour will still work (albeit no more securely  I admit I haven't used alternatives much (ie never in anger) but this does sound like an approach that will give a clean mechanism across distros.   Certainly better than my ill-thought-out wild guess.
