What we've been able to find is:           (previous version of web site)        (later version of web site)  The above archived aura.overcoffee.com page suggests that web sites existed with "Powered By Instant v2.0 another OverCoffee production" in the footer.  The archived overcoffee.com page suggests that the company's goal was "packages of web development services and applications." Linked pages refer to "we provide all our clients with a log-in username and password to their own area of the SelfServe control panel" and "we partner with our clients from initial consultation through design, hosting, and management."  This might mean that "Instant v2.0" was a web-design offering that typically resulted in a web site hosted and maintained by the vendor.  To obtain a CVE ID on the oss-security list, it's necessary to establish that the vendor has (currently or in the past) packaged the product in question as open source.  To obtain a CVE ID at all, it's necessary to establish that there is or was a specific packaged product. A CVE ID is not assigned for "web development services" that create customer-specific sites/code, even if multiple customers happened to receive a specific file (such as product_cat.php) and a vulnerability is found in that file. Also, it's necessary to establish that customers are responsible for security updates of the specific packaged product. This is very often the case if different installations of a product are installed on servers controlled by different customers. In this situation, this seems perhaps unlikely because the six example sites do not all have unique IP addresses. (Admittedly, it's possible for a vendor to initially maintain its customers' web sites but then later announce that the customers need to start maintaining them on their own.)  Also, note that this vendor (apparently from Iowa in the U.S.) is not the same as the InstantCMS vendor (see apparently located in Russia.  To summarize:    - if you know that this is open source, you can send more     information about that to oss-security@...ts.openwall.com    - if you don't know whether it's open source but know that "Instant     v2.0" was shipped as a software package installable by arbitrary     customers, you can send more information about that to     cve-assign@...re.org (That address can be used, optionally, even     if it is open source. Please do not send to both addresses.)  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =ixTb -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
