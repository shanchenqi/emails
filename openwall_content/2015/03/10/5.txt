ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Instructions with register operands ignore eventual segment overrides encoded for them. Due to an insufficiently conditional assignment such a bogus segment override can, however, corrupt a pointer used subsequently to store the result of the instruction.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest might be able to read sensitive data relating to other guests, or to cause denial of service on the host. Arbitrary code execution, and therefore privilege escalation, cannot be excluded.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen 3.2.x and later are vulnerable. Xen 3.1.x and earlier have not been inspected.  Only x86 systems are vulnerable.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  There is no mitigation available for this issue.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Felix Wilhelm of ERNW GmbH.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.                  xen-unstable, Xen 4.5.x, Xen 4.4.x         Xen 4.3.x, Xen 4.2.x  $   $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
