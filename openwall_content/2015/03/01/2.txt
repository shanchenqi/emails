They have requested I not reveal the details, so I am treating that and the patch details as embargoed for the time being.  Without revealing too much (I hope) I can confirm:  * It is a known vulnerability  - to upstream that is, but no CVE assigned.  * The initial report of this issue to upstream occured during  * Squid 1.x, 2.x, and 3.0 releases are all vulnerable.  * All Squid-3.1 stable releases are not vunerable.  - eg, you can bump the fixed version number back to for most OS distributions.   For the record; there is now FALSE information floating around in some "copies" about it being about CRLF issues. The Cisco report came to my attention first, but they are not alone.  To all those people cut-n-pasting blurb text from in place of the JPCERT description: please dont do that. There are multiple "HTTP response splitting" attack vectors which have nothing to do with the (current) description. This is one of those cases.
