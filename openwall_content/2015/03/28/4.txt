There is currently no CVE ID for this issue that apparently remains within the patched code: the issue that an authenticated user can upload a .php file. As far as we can tell, Berta implements only one account, and this account (for the Downloaded Berta product) is authorized to modify any file. For example, see the and support questions.  The ability to bypass image validation by using certain .php files that begin with a "GIF89" substring might be considered a bug, but is perhaps not a security bug. The getimagesize test may be present for functionality reasons, e.g.,    - Berta is typically used by non-experts who would simply     be confused if they uploaded a malformed file    - if getimagesize didn't succeed, then Berta probably wouldn't be     able to create a thumbnail or do other image scaling  and not for security reasons.  In any case, the vendor might decide to make an announcement that authenticated upload of .php files was actually not within the bounds of their security model, and in that case a second CVE ID would probably be assigned.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =qjgx -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
