In order to raise some exposure, and make sure admins check/fix their config, we'll issue a DSA, so I'm requesting a CVE for this.  The problem is that by default LDAP users have write access to their own attributes. If LDAP is used to grant permissions, and those permissions are stored as user attributes (for example by using the ou), then an user can modify its own permissions, which is usually not wanted.  It's a Debian specific issue, but the OpenLDAP documentation [2] actually recommends something like that.
