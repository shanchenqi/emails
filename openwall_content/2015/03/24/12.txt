It's worth noting that the C1 rating mentioned in the launchpad bug is referring to this: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Vulnerability_Management#Incident_report_taxonomy  Which is "Not considered a practical vulnerability (but some people might assign a CVE for it)".  So it's not necessarily saying there is no vulnerability/CVE needed for other versions. Just that it's not considered serious enough for an OSSA, by my reading.
