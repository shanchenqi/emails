As a member of the OpenStack VMT, I have no opinion on this. We don't generally express an opinion on whether a bug report _can_ have an associated CVE, only on whether the bug is associated with an attack scenario we deem likely enough to warrant the effort expended in discussing and fixing it under embargo, backporting to supported stable branches, then creating and publishing a formal security advisory. Of the many reports we initially receive as potential vulnerabilities, only a fraction actually end in an advisory as opposed to being considered a security hardening opportunity. --  Jeremy Stanley  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
