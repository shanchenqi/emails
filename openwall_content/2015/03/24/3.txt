All subsequent 1.6.x and 1.7.x releases are affected.  Similarly to the issue with python-requests, the issue could be exploited in the following ways:  - If you are the redirection source (i.e. you can make rest-client hit your URL), you can make rest-client perform a request to any third-party domain with cookies of your choosing. This may be useful in performing a session fixation attack. - If you are the redirection target (i.e. you can make a third-party site redirect to your URL), you can steal any cookies set by the third-party redirection.
