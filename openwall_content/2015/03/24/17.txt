If you have signed metadata it should be easy to counter this attack for  packages, right? If you serve you metadata from a trusted source then  it's also solved for metadata. Even if you serve metadata over  non-trusted channel it should be easy to bound the size of "root"  metadata file and record sizes of the next level files in it, etc. Am I  missing any complications?  >> The expiry was something added a bit later after the paper to address >> the downgrade and replay attacks. > > Some more notes. > > While the "Update Scenario" is well covered, we are of course facing issues of "bringing up a system". > > Like discussed in the thread, how does the customer find a known good ISO image > for download. > > While our installer is protecting itself with GPG signatures, but there is need for > the root of trust of the CD medium itself. > > So for SUSE we publish checksums on the https://download.suse.com/ website at least. > For openSUSE the GPG/SHA and MD5 are on .  Hm, it's HTTP and a big part of this thread is about dangers of exactly  this situation.  --  Alexander Cherepanov  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
