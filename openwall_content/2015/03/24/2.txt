Becaue CUPS has a browsing feature that, when enabled, allows remote hosts to announce shared printers, a malicious host or user could send a specially-crafted UDP packet to a CUPS server announcing an arbitrary printer name that includes ANSI escape sequences.  Since the CUPS daemon does not remove these characters, a user on the targeted system could query the printer list (using 'lpstat -a', for example).  If this were done in a terminal that supported the ANSI escape sequences (like a terminal with support for color), then code execution could be possible as the terminal would interpret the ANSI escape sequences contained in the printer name.  A patch for this is available at  My apologies, this issue has been sitting way to long and is certainly not worth a long embargo.  I can't wait till I'm done cleaning house of all these embargoed issues that shouldn't be embargoed. I strongly urge other vendors to do the same.  --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
