Some more notes.  While the "Update Scenario" is well covered, we are of course facing issues of "bringing up a system".  Like discussed in the thread, how does the customer find a known good ISO image for download.  While our installer is protecting itself with GPG signatures, but there is need for the root of trust of the CD medium itself.  So for SUSE we publish checksums on the https://download.suse.com/ website at least. For openSUSE the GPG/SHA and MD5 are on .
