For purposes of CVE, we typically don't think of vulnerabilities in the way expressed in "without a way to make the migration process fail, this is a bug with security consequence, but not a vulnerability." In other words, for a CVE, the attacker can be a person who wishes to have an unauthorized volume attachment after the bug is triggered. The attacker does not need to be a person who has determined a reproducible way to trigger the bug.  > if live-migration is executed while process keep using big size of > memory by benchmark tool or something like that in VM instance and > then the waiting status of live-migration could be persisted, > eventually live-migration will be failed.  We think that nobody commented on whether this is a feasible way to actively trigger the bug.  > you're suggesting potential exploits involving >  > 1. disconnecting physical network interfaces  We think the intended security property of this OpenStack product is: "if network connectivity is disrupted by anyone (authorized or not) during a live migration, then access control for volumes still must match users' expectations afterward."  It is conceivable that the intended security property of this OpenStack product is instead "if network connectivity is disrupted during a live migration, then access control for volumes afterward is undefined." In this case, maybe you mean that the CVE should apply only to Havana, because the only relevant root cause is a Havana bug. The reasoning in that scenario would be:     1 - a Havana bug (e.g., or possibly the combination of        and a second bug) makes it possible to force a failure        of a live migration     2 - this was not previously considered a vulnerability     3 - however, the relevant OpenStack product has a required security        property of "There must not be any software bugs that allow        live-migration failure attacks, because these attacks are        equivalent to attacks against volume access control."     4 - therefore, the bug in item 1 is promoted to a vulnerability,        and is the bug directly associated with     5 - consequently, would not be used in an advisory        because Havana is unsupported by the OpenStack VMT  So, does the OpenStack VMT have a position on whether to choose this latter scenario? In other words, if live migration fails because of a disconnected physical network interface, is access control for volumes intentionally undefined afterward?  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =YcdN -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
