For the 'tmp' issue, we were contacted at Docker about tmp directory usage during building or running of tests for Docker itself. It is not clear if is a reflection of this, but it appears so. In that specific case, we performed triage and determined that either no such abuses of tmp existed at the time, or that those uses of tmp were run within containers in such a way that no vulnerability existed.    > > > > Could this be a dupe of the index.docker.io registry misconfiguration > > that had at least one redirect to http:// (now fixed) for the actual > > (unverified) image data? > > No, this was stuff like downloading debian signing keys over http rather > than https, and other sensitive content in similarly unsafe ways.   >From the descriptions I've read here, I had also thought this was a duplicate of (HTTP downgrade attack against registry).  Both of these reports precede the establishment of a focused security team and process at Docker.
