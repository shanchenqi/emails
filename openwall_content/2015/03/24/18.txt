There is no hard information in those bug reports.  It's not clear what, precisely, they are about, and so it is impossible to tell if they actually have been fixed.  I appreciate that you clean out old stuff, but doing it this way makes it seem you suddenly have developed a policy for secrecy around security issues.  >   Could this be a dupe of the index.docker.io registry misconfiguration that had at least one redirect to http:// (now fixed) for the actual (unverified) image data?
