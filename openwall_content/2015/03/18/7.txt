Hi,  The Linux kernel Intel early microcode loader was vulnerable to a stack overflow.  This issue was fixed in upstream commit     And was introduced in kernel 3.8+ in ("x86/microcode_intel_early.c: Early update ucode on Intel's CPU").  It potentially allows kernel execution using a specially crafted microcode, and I could not see that CONFIG_CC_STACKPROTECTOR_REGULAR was of any help since it left get_matching_model_microcode() unprotected on my build.  It was protected using CONFIG_CC_STACKPROTECTOR_STRONG with  It is not relevant that the tampered microcode would be refused by the CPU (since it is signed by Intel) because kernel execution would happen before that.  The attack vector could be from anyone between Intel and people shipping/packaging the microcode, or could potentially be used to get a resilient backdoor on system already compromised by sticking a tampered microcode on the initrd.  It would also allow root to get kernel execution by recreating the initrd.  I admit these are overly paranoid scenarios, but I _think_ there's still a privilege crossing from root to kernel exec which could make sense on certain security model.  I could not see an answer from cve-assign when this issue was discussed on security@...nel.org.  Could a CVE be assigned to this please?
