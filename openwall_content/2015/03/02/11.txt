This patch seems related to:    prodid   qty   variations   subId  whereas your report is about:    id   cid  (An entirely separate issue is that the patch has a "$_POST['qty'] = abs((int)$_GET['prodid']);" line that might result in unintended quantity values.)  So, we think that there is not, in any sense, a "version" of ZeusCart that fixes any attack vector that you reported. If there were an incomplete fix, additional CVE IDs may be required.  Use for all of the SQL injection issues in your report.   > http://{TARGET}/admin/?do=getphpinfo  Use  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =G7BY -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
