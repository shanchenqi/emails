In order to ensure full traceability, we need a CVE number assigned that we can attach to further notifications. This issue is already public.  Title: Information leak in Etherpad exports Reporter: webzwo0i Versions: through  Description: webzwo0i reported a vulnerability in the export functionality of current Etherpad releases. When exporting a padID all pads for which the requested ID is a substring are also returned, regardless of access restriction, resulting in an information leak. This includes group pads created via the API.  Notes: This bug was introduced in commit which was initially included in the release, and is fixed in commit which will appear in a future release.
