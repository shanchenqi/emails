Instead of the cookies only being set for the domain which sent the HTTP response, they are also sent to the redirection target, regardless of its domain.  The issue could be exploited in the following ways: * If you are the redirection source (ie. you can make Requests hit your URL), you can make Requests perform a request to any third-party domain with cookies of your choosing. This may be useful in performing a session fixation attack. * If you are the redirection target (ie. you can make a third-party site redirect to your URL), you are able to steal any cookies set by the third-party redirection.  The change that introduced this vulnerability was first included in version of requests. As such every version since that version up to and including are vulnerable to this attack.  Please assign an identifier for this.
