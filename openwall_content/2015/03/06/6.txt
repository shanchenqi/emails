It occurred to me that we could have a patch that has a global switch (eg a file in, say, /etc/sysconfig and a corresponding switch for individual applications) that switches on the correct behaviour.   I know it's a bit of a mess, but that way people who don't care will continue in blissful ignorance and people that do care can do something about it.  jch   >>  >> Regards, Michael >>  >> On 6 March at Kurt Seifried <kseifried@...hat.com> >> wrote: >>>  >>>  >>> On AM, John Haxby wrote: >>>> PEP cites 11 CVEs that resulted from python not properly >>>> validating certificates.
