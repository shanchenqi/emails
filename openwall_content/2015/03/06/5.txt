Take care though if you do, all the earlier versions have different logics surrounding how the connection data gets accounted.  I hope this one is better for you. Still outstanding on Mitre's verdict about the CVE number though. JPCERT tell me that should be next week, but you probably know more than me how reliable an estimate that is.
