So my thought is this:  Vendor has front page that recommends doing something completely insane and insecure (http/md5s/etc.). On the back end (good lucking finding this) vendor does something sort of secure (gpg signing of packages, no clue if key distribution is secure) but this is not really documented well.  Does this win a CVE or not? I personally think yes, yes it does.  Mitre as always is the final arbiter of what is cool. I mean what is a CVE.  --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
