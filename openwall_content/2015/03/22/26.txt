No, the scope of does not include that. Use for this vulnerability in dulwich.  The scope of is currently undefined, in part because intentionally doesn't have any related information. Usage of is, very roughly, concerned with "The string .git/ for a directory name has always been considered Very Special. Therefore, other strings with equivalence relationships to .git/ must also be considered Very Special."  The root cause of the problem in dulwich seems to be "The string .git/ for a directory name was not considered Very Special." This is completely distinct conceptually, and is a much simpler case for CVE coverage.  There are two types of concerns with First, can only apply to omitted equivalence-relationship handling in source code that is, or is directly copied from, "Git before 1.9.x before 2.0.x before 2.1.x before and 2.2.x before source code. It is not possible to have a CVE for a cross-implementation vulnerability class of this equivalence-relationship handling. Second, usage of seems to span multiple types of problems, possibly including all of:         - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =sxen -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
