Well, this can mean basically anything.  Maybe they can't do embargoes at all, considering how fixed software is delivered to end users.  > 3.

Montavista and Wind River are subsidies of Cavium and Intel, and the parent company product security teams should be on a (linux-)distros-type list anyway.  > The idea behind such list is that we'd let people decide who they want > to notify: all distros (including this separate list) or just the more > free'ish subset (not including this separate list).  Why would you give priority to a free-ish distributions?  What's the goal?  We are all on the same Internet, which is why I fail to see the benefit of distributing vulnerability information according based on this criterion.  > And indeed, the separation between these sub-lists is unclear.

Being commercial hopefully means that your security team members don't need an actual job that pays the bills, which may create additional obligations.  If the security team is just a bunch of volunteers, you have different potential for conflicts of interest (not sure what's worse, an additional job, or commercial pressures).  > Comments?  What's happening on the distros list these days?  Who are the primary contributors?  Are there discussions about technical details?  Or is it just CRD coordination?  Or do people just drop off pre-advisories?  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
