The package being signing using the same key over time signifies that it is coming from authoritative source (unless you've been MITMed a long time), the fingerprint of the OpenPGP key should be included in email announcements and other documents that are being mirrored by multiple sources, reducing the likelihood of a MITM if corresponding information is the same in multiple archives over a long time. Its always better to have a direct validation path to the key in question, but all is not in vein without it.   - --  - ---------------------------- Kristian Fiskerstrand Blog: http://blog.sumptuouscapital.com Twitter: @krifisk - ---------------------------- Public OpenPGP key at hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net fpr:94CB AFDD 35AA 0B7F E3ED FAE3 - ---------------------------- Aquila non capit muscas The eagle does not hunt flies -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----  =AT4h -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
