Yes, it is.  Often, things are bad enough that just looking at the software for five minutes is sufficient to rediscover the vulnerability.  Or maybe a couple of different vulnerabilities with similar impact.  There's also interaction with CVE assignment.  The current, working assignment process requires short embargoes at least.  And a certain subset of reporters cares about the CVE assignment above anything else because it's a widely-accepted metric for having found something, which in turn indicates that the reporters have done their job.  I think we can and should reduce the number of embargoes, but we'd have to address the CVE assignment process for public issues at the same time.  Reducing the number of embargoes would also help those quasi-proprietary vendors and show them that building upstream relationships and tracking their software portfolio are the key tasks, and not getting a few days advance notice for vulnerabilities.  Most GNU/Linux distributions can fix about anything that's fixable at all within two or three weeks (and that includes the analysis required to actually understand the bug).  Most quasi-proprietary vendors work on totally different time scales, and even if they do not have to do the analysis themselves, a few weeks is nothing to them.  But here's another perspective.  Lior Kaplan writes, âEven if the issue isn't severe, upstream should get a fair chance to fix issue before making them public.â   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
