Tor provides their download via HTTPS from the same domain and has both HSTS preloading and HPKP. They provide a link to a GPG signature for the tarball too, but that doesn't help most users unless their distro is using it in package sources. AFAICT they plan on doing Authenticode signing, but they're doing a good job without it.  The problem with these Linux distro downloads is that it's consistently done via http. That's fine for packages because package signing takes care of it. It's fine if the download is done in a way that results in verification like a torrent, but otherwise the user needs to manually verify a hash or signature and that's rarely going to happen.  It's and Debian shouldn't have an HTTP download link for the ISO on their front page :P.
