Thus, GPG signatures and the like.  I think I need to add that Cygwin's setup-*.exe was special, and that it actually needed the switch to https.  (In addition to having proper signatures for it.)  Thank you, David!  Other software downloads also benefit from https slightly - not only in the way I mentioned (partially hiding from some observers which exact software is being downloaded), but also through providing some limited security from MITM attacks for people's manual downloads even when those people wouldn't bother to verify signatures.  This is not limited to just Cygwin, although with Cygwin's setup-*.exe I think it mattered more than for most other software.  However, I think this is an operations best practices issue and not a software issue, whereas lack of proper signatures in a software update mechanism is much closer to being an issue with the software itself.
