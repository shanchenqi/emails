Fedora asks the user to validate the download via a signed hash file obtaining via HTTPS. Kali asks the user to validate the download via a signed SHA1 hash file obtained via HTTPS (that blurb on the front page is out-of-date, there are no MD5 sums)  I don't think the difference between SHA1 and is very important right now, so the only significant difference is that Fedora has the HTTPS domain in browser HSTS preload lists.  It would be much better to provide the download via HTTPS from a domain that's HSTS preloaded and ideally has some level of key pinning. We are all well aware that few users are going to go through a manual process on the command-line to verify the download, especially if they're on Windows as they won't have the commands that are being used.
