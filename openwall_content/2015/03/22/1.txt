The rest of this message can probably be skipped unless someone cares about the details of why was sent.  We had previously proposed ... had security-relevant value even though it was later determined to be mis-protecting." This was based on your earlier phrase of "ends up protecting the .altinstr_replacement from faulting." We now understand that "ends up protecting the .altinstr_replacement from faulting" actually does not ever protect anything. If the "pointer to the instruction which might fault" points to .altinstr_replacement, this is completely useless for preventing denial-of-service attacks. More generally, having the "pointer to the instruction which might fault" point to .altinstr_replacement results in absolutely zero security-relevant value. Thus, there isn't a second CVE ID.  >>   - a ... CVE id for the >>     >>     change > > The above commit is the fix, not a security issue.  This was just a question of commonly used, but imprecise, terminology. In typical usage on the oss-security list, stating that a CVE ID is for a commit means that the CVE ID is associated with the vulnerability that the commit fixed. This imprecise terminology can work poorly in situations where a commit fixed one security problem but introduced a different security problem, or situations in which there is a possible misinterpretation that that had happened.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =ughl -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
