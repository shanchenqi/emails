[...]  And the repository signing key is hopefully also published to a well-known keyserver network along with signatures from maintainers of the primary distribution repository, some of whom may be known (either directly or transitively via other key signatures) to the end user. And repository signing keys can be gradually replaced by generating new keys well in advance and signing them with the old keys as a transition, then adding them to the trust keyring long enough before the current key is retired that clients already have it once it starts to get used. --  Jeremy Stanley  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
