(Loading fonts from user-writeable > ~/.fonts seems to be enabled by default.)  I am not aware of any current browser which meets any of these criteria, much less all of them:   - supports the ancient BDF bitmap font format in its webfonts, instead of     scalable font formats such as OpenType, TrueType, or Postscript Type 1.   - uses the old X server-side font technology instead of rendering on     the client side, where it can do complex text layout & antialiasing   - downloads a BDF font from a website, stores to a local directory,     runs mkfontdir in that directory, and adds it to the X font path.  The primary exploit path X.Org is aware of these would be a local user who can login to an X session already, running "xset +fp" to add a directory under their control to the font path of that X server in order to execute code with the privileges of the X server (often root).  --  	-Alan Coopersmith-              alan.coopersmith@...cle.com 	  X.Org Security Response Team - xorg-security@...ts.x.org   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
