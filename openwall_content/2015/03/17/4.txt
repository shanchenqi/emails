The file types that can be shown depend on the user context         in which the exploitable application is running. If the user is root         a full compromise of the server--including confidential or sensitive         files--would be possible.          XXE can also be used to attack the availability of the server         via denial of service as the references within a xml document         can trivially trigger an amplification attack.   Mitigation:         Users should upgrade to Batik 1.8+   Credit:         This issue was independently reported by Nicolas Gregoire of AGARRI         (www.agarri.fr) and Kevin Schaller of ERNW (www.ernw.de).
