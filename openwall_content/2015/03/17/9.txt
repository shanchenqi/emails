The message is about three patches, but the patches are mentioned with inconsistent terminology. What we think was meant is:   The commit message says "TLS protocol: add handshake state validation" but this is also referenced as "The Impersonation patch" and "A TLS impersonation attack was discovered in Mono's TLS stack by researchers at Inria." Although there isn't a description of what impersonation vulnerability existed, almost certainly it is "SKIP-TLS ... Mono: default TLS library vulnerable to client impersonation. Version prevents the attack" as listed on the https://www.smacktls.com web site.    The commit message says "Remove the EXPORT ciphers and related code path" - this directly matches "The EXPORT cipher removal patch" but it is apparently also referenced as "FREAK patch" and "vulnerability to FREAK." (It is conceivable that would also be applicable to FREAK attacks.)    The commit message says "Remove the client-side SSLv2 fallback," which apparently matches both "SSLv2 support" and "SSLv2 patch." MITRE does currently accept reports from authors of SSL/TLS code who want to characterize their own SSLv2 support, after a recent drop of support, as a vulnerability (i.e., "These vulnerabilities affect ..." in together with https://uk.linkedin.com/in/directhex).
