Not entirely sure what to expect from the nvd site for a CVE like this (about 1 week old counting from redhats advisory) but information is at best incomplete at:   Here are a few problems with the info:   * rhel6 / is listed as impacted (but already the linked bz    expands this to rhel5 and rhel7.  * In fact this bug (as I understand it) is in all versions of the    verbs kernel module except some point in and rhel6 updates.    Affected list grows to:     1) other distributions building kernel with infiniband/verbs enabled     2) other distributions providing "external" infiniband/verbs modules     3) other sources providing 3rd party infiniband/verbs modules  * I know that Mellanox (found under 3 above) has released an update    (MLNX_OFED that fixes the issue, but this info is missing.     If this was not the correct place to contribute/fix information maybe someone can point me in the correct direction.  /Peter K  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
