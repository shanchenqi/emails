The issue may be corrected for WebKitGTK+ and WebKitGTK+ using the patch at [2]. Applications are affected if they use the WebKit2GTK+ API with WEBKIT_TLS_ERRORS_POLICY_FAIL. (This policy is the default in WebKitGTK+ and later; applications using earlier versions of WebKitGTK+ must opt-in to certificate verification failures by calling webkit_web_context_set_tls_errors_policy.) Applications using the original WebKitGTK+ 1 API are unaffected because they must handle certificate verification themselves.  Please assign a CVE for this issue.  Thanks,  Michael  [1] http://webkitgtk.org/ [2]   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
