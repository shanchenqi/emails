This is mitigated by the fact that it requires an authed user.  With my best regards, - --  Pierre Schweitzer <pierre@...ctos.org> System & Network Administrator Senior Kernel Developer ReactOS Deutschland e.V. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =GmZ8 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
