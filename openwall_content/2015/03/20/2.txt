Based on the changes, we think that there is a single underlying issue in which the attack vector seems to be essentially expressed by:    $attack_reset_url = str_replace("user/reset/{$user1->id()}",                                   "user/reset/{$user2->id()}", $reset_url);  regardless of the Drupal version -- i.e., 6.x, 7.x, or an unreleased 8.x version. (For purposes of determining the correct number of CVE IDs, it is probably not relevant that 6.x and 7.x have different ways in which problematic accounts may have been created.)

This one might be more complicated for CVE assignment. If a single change to a single piece of code addressed all of these open-redirect issues, then a single CVE ID may be possible. However, it appears that the situation might be a series of related problems that were found in different places (and possibly different versions) by different people. lists two external discoverers, as well as discoverers from the Drupal Security Team. As an example, suppose that there were three independent reports, and each report included three unique affected parameters: one of which existed only in 6.x, one of which existed only in 7.x, and one of which existed in both 6.x and 7.x. That would have 9 CVE IDs.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =bJNA -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
