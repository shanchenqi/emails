Enea is an independent software vendor  which have both proprietary and open source software (Enea Linux, OSE, ..). Enea's software is used in many mobile devices, telecom infrastructure (e.g. radio base stations) and other mission critical systems thus security is very important for our customers/users.  I am part of the Enea Security Response Team (ESRT). You can verify this by sending an email to the Enea security team at security<at>enea<dot>com or by visiting Enea's security page: http://www.enea.com/solutions/Enea-Linux/Security/  I am also leading the security activities  in the Yocto Project. The Linux Foundation hosts the Yocto Project as an open source project, provides a vendor neutral collaboration environment, and encourages community contributions in line with the best practices of the open source development model.  Please note that I am only requesting membership on behalf of Enea. Our engagement in the Yocto project will however be used as a way to spread the security update to a wider audience once the embargo has expired.  For further info regarding the Yocto Project security work please refer to the wiki page: https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Security  Here is my GPG fingerprint: Download public key:  pub  uid Sona Sarmadi (Sona@...T) <sona.sarmadi@...a.com> sig  sig3 __________ [selfsig]  Best Regards Sona Sarmadi Enea Security Team -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v2  oJZcMz2cpGY+ZcGbXZTC =QDq+ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
