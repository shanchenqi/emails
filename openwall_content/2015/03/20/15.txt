Itâs for the linux distro variants, exclusively.  The Solaris team have their own security contacts and Iâm not one of them.

We take our responsibilities very seriously.  jch  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
