Does anyone have a preference for two CVE IDs divided in this way:    - one CVE ID for the         change that was introduced in Our incomplete understanding     from is that     this change had security-relevant value even though it was later     determined to be mis-protecting.    - a second CVE id for the         change  ? Otherwise, we will assign only the latter.  is about "This is to prevent future misuses of the __ex_table entry like there was for xsaves/xrstors." Typically, code improvements for "prevent future misuses" purposes would not lead to additional CVE IDs.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =/+Zb -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
