I would expect that people are reporting vulnerabilities to the list because they see it as the most responsible form of disclosure. I don't think they're in the position to make an accurate risk/reward trade-off though. There's little information on how the distributions are making use of this information. I don't think many people would be reporting bugs to it if they knew the answer to that question...  The distros subscribed to the list are in the position to state whether it's helping them minimize the delay between disclosure and shipping a patch or whether it's simply tying their hands for more time. I'm sure it's a mix of both, but I'd like to hear from them.  For most vulnerabilities, I doubt that having early notice is at all helpful. The important factor is that there's a working patch out of the gate from upstream and ideally new point releases for any of the supported versions.  It's just a artificial delay before shipping a patch can happen. IMO, only distributions with ancient versions where the patches don't apply cleanly are going to benefit. There's also the possibility of related issues, but upstream and the discover of the issues are in the best position to find those.
