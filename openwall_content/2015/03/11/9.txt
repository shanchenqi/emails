You can test for the common bugs extremely easily - you need two types of bogus certificate installed on the server: - A completely untrusted (eg. self-signed) certificate - A certificate signed by a trusted authority but for the wrong hostname  It's not too hard to test SSH connections in a similar manner (just regen the ssh host keys after the first connection).  Alternatively, you could make your OpenSSL modules for various languages return client ctxs that verify by default - the topic of this discussion :)  Regards,   Michael  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
