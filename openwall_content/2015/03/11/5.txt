Indeed, please cut it out.  You're dealing with an individual, me, here.   I'm just someone who is trying to improve things in small but useful ways.   Someone who, incidentally, is personally hurt all of this.  >  > I think there's probably some cultural disconnect here that is > causing issues, a big part of Red Hat is "upstream first" and doing > things the open source way.  We're actually no different, whatever you might think.  (Obviously this does not apply to the large suite of closed or semi-closed applications that oracle produces; I'm only talking about the Linux group here.)  [snip]  > However here's the cool thing.

I was asking for cooperation to come up with a solution, participating with other people who, like, I assumed, Red Hat, have an interest in solving this specific problem without breaking existing (admitedly flawed) applications.  I know it's  not straightforward, if it was I'd've just produced a patch.  I'm still happy to work with anyone to sort this out.

If this fixes the specific problem as a side effect that would be great.  Details are lacking though, and there's no obvious link here to making adapting for backwards compatibility (and I have absolutely no arguments with the rejected solutions for Python).
