I proposed this in the context of me giving up reporting these sorts of bugs to RedHat (go search my BZ account), and frankly since you don't have the resources to perform simple tests against your main products (RHEV, Satellite, RHN), then a blanket solution seems reasonable.  > So it's not that I'm unwilling, I simply don't see why you need massive > corporate/community buy in at this point, premature optimization and all > that.

It's not a problem because nobody's looking.  Holy crap, just look at Satellite 6 and tell me you think that product doesn't need more than an audit.
