Same > reported type ("stack corruption"  In this context, we don't look at stack corruption as a "type."  In general, the number of assigned CVE IDs can depend on both the inline text of the oss-security request message as well as other information that may be available at relatively low cost.  Here's are two examples. (We'll use "integer underflow" in the examples even though that can be vague as discussed in the Alternate Terms.)  Real example in open-source FreeXL code:    #1:  A flaw was found in the way FreeXL reads sectors from the input   file. A specially crafted file could possibly result in stack   corruption    #3: A flaw was found in the way FreeXL handles a premature EOF. A   specially crafted input file could possibly result in stack corruption    Both of these say "stack corruption." However, #1 is about   "workbook->sector_end <= (workbook->p_in - workbook->sector_buf)" -   the unpatched code omitted a necessary test for an integer   underflow. #3 is not related to an integer underflow.  Hypothetical example:    ClosedSourceProduct 1.1 changelog    1.1 is a mandatory security update to address these two   stack-corruption issues:    - fixed an integer underflow vulnerability (Bug    - fixed an EOF handling vulnerability (Bug  If reasonably possible, we want the number of CVE IDs to be the same in the open-source example and the closed-source example.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =Jm7d -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
