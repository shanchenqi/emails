The issue affects to all Linux process even if they are not using shared  libraries (statically compiled). Grsecurity/PaX is also affected.  The total entropy for the VVAR/VDSO, mmapped files and libraries of a processes  are reduced by eight. The number of possible locations where the mapped areas  can be placed are reduced by  On 32-bit systems, for example, the entropy for libraries is reduced from 28 to  25, which means that libraries only have 32 different places where they can be  loaded.
