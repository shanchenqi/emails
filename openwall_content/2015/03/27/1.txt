Listing four flaw descriptions with four reproducers does not necessarily imply a specific number of CVE IDs. We are not going to run the product with the reproducers to gather additional information.  We have:       > #1:  A flaw was found in the way FreeXL reads sectors from the input > file.

In other words, the product did not verify that the calculation of the unsigned "chunk" value occurred as expected.  Use    > #3: A flaw was found in the way FreeXL handles a premature EOF.

Is a NULL pointer dereference going to occur before the code reaches a point where there can be stack corruption?

Or does it refer to one of the two possibilities listed above for #2?  "check requests for workbook memory allocation" could also conceivably refer to tests of the return value of malloc, but no such tests were added in the patch.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =Vze4 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
