ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Emulation routines in the hypervisor dealing with certain system devices check whether the access size by the guest is a supported one. When the access size is unsupported these routines failed to set the data to be returned to the guest for read accesses, so that hypervisor stack contents are copied into the destination of the operation, thus becoming visible to the guest.  IMPACT ======  A malicious HVM guest might be able to read sensitive data relating to other guests.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen 3.2.x and later are vulnerable. Xen 3.1.x and earlier have not been inspected.  Only HVM guests can take advantage of this vulnerability.  Only x86 systems are vulnerable.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only PV guests will avoid this issue.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.         xen-unstable, Xen 4.5.x, Xen 4.4.x, Xen 4.3.x, Xen 4.2.x  $  $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.) -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =BATt -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
