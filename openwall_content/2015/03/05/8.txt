If internal corporate software stops working because of invalid certificates, wasn't it broken anyway?  jch -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  =NJa4 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
