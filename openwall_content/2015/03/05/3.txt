I'd be interested in that, too. In case this out-of-band release is about an important security fix, then either this is something new (details still to be disclosed). Or it is associated with (e.g. incomplete or buggy fix in the January release)? The detais (named as "SKIP-TLS") had been disclosed just this week along with the "FREAK" attack (see https://www.smacktls.com/#skip). Former descriptions of only indicated a failure to properly check the ChangeCipherSpec in the TLS connection handshake; but apparently - esp. on client side - much more could go wrong in former JSSE implemenations.  Maybe someone involved in openJDK could tell more...
