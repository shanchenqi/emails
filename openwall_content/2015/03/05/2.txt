With a non-malicious input, this could lead to heap corruption and a crash.  However, under the right circumstances, a malicious attacker could potentially use this vulnerability to hijack program execution, and on some platforms, execute arbitrary code.   Remediation -----------  Prior to being notified of this issue, the VLC team had already made changes to the 2.2 development branch that corrects this issue by reinitilizing the filters when a format change is detected. However, the fixes had not yet been backported to the 2.1 maintenance branch.                                                                                 Once notified, the VLC team quickly resolved the issue by backporting the relevant patches to the maintenance branch They also added an additional check on both the development[6] and maintenance[7] branches for good measure.  [8] was assigned to this issue.  Timeline --------   VLC team notified of issue   Fixed in VLC repository   VLC maintenance release   A more detailed writeup can be found on my blog [9].
