As far as we can tell, what you mean is that https://docs.python.org/2/library/ssl.html says "the default settings of the ssl module are not necessarily appropriate for your application" and therefore it was the responsibility of the restkit developer to handle validation, because the goals of restkit include completely general access to all https URLs. In other words, it appears that your position is that it is acceptable for ssl.wrap_socket to have cert_reqs=CERT_NONE as a default, because this is fully documented and because there's an easy-to-notice "Warning" paragraph. This seems reasonable (although potentially controversial).  Use  Also, our understanding is that this does not overlap the changes did not have any effect on whether ssl.wrap_socket uses CERT_NONE.  Finally, your message didn't explain why https://tv.eurosport.com/ was used: apparently, tv.eurosport.com is an example of a live web site with a certificate-name mismatch.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =rQbd -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
