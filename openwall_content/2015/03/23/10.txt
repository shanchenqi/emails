You can to accompany the package with Release{,.gpg} (or just InRelease)  files. Kinda fat detached signature. I do it when I download files like  hd-media/boot.img.gz for installer.  > The advantage of having a > global repository state signature is that you can do things like this > without difficulty.

I'm not sure what you mean here. Presumably you can have any subset of  the packages and they will be happily verified against Release file?  --  Alexander Cherepanov  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
