Cygwin takes the same approach.  It distributes a file listing packages (including their names, cryptographic hashes, and lengths), and this file list is signed. The Cygwin package manager downloads actual packages from untrusted locations, but before installing it, it checks if the package hash and length match the digitally-signed values (using a public key embedded in the package manager's executable).  Currently Cygwin uses MD5 as its cryptographic hash algorithm, which has been totally busted as a crypto hash algorithm. Yes, Cygwin also checks the length, but I think using MD5 in is absurd.  Thankfully, the Cygwin folks are already in the process of moving to once that move completes, they should be much stronger against MITM attacks.  --- David A.
