Fixes bug bug first | appeared in OSX   2. | A relay could crash with an assertion error if a buffer of | exactly the wrong layout was passed to buf_pullup() at exactly the | wrong  time.   The second issue has been addressed in DSA (the first obviously not, since it's MacOS-specific)  Cheers,         Moritz           Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
