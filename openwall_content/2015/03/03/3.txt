Not every buffer overflow is a vulnerability: it can only be a vulnerability if an attacker can trigger it.  Is there any reason why it would be useful/sensible to pass untrusted (pseudo-terminal filename, fd) pairs to the -S option? It seems to me that if you're passing partially or entirely attacker-controlled filenames to this option, you have probably already lost.
