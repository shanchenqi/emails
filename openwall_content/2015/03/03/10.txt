This suggests that, at the time that the default configuration was shipped for the repo.maven.apache.org web site was not accessible via https, or at least not for free. suggests that https was available for $10.) Given that that is what existed, we don't feel that there is a clear answer to the question of whether Maven should have refused to access http://repo.maven.apache.org URLs or whether it should have accepted the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks. Neither answer would be inherently a "mistake." At least some deployments of Maven are on relatively secure networks at software-development companies, where man-in-the-middle attacks are relatively difficult and/or infrequent. Installation of Maven on a portable machine that is commonly connected via public Wi-Fi is not the prevailing use case.  (The question on the other side, specifically whether repo.maven.apache.org should ever have been deployed with its former configuration, is site-specific and is outside the scope of CVE. Note that this was apparently intentional: says "The reality is that prior to moving to a CDN, it was going to be pretty intensive to offer SSL on the scale of traffic we were seeing. The priority at that time was ensuring higher availability.")  Also, says "It's possible to sign jars, but in my experimentation with standard tools, these signatures aren't checked." says "Signatures have been required on Central for years and there are tools to verify them, including repository managers." MITRE has not researched whether any version of Maven was able to download and use a signed file, and could have checked the signature but did not actually implement signature checking. There is a possibility of one or more CVE IDs if anyone has identified a corresponding Maven code problem or fix.  To summarize, we don't think it's currently worthwhile to assign CVE IDs for all cases in which any product obtains code from an http endpoint and could then conceivably execute that code. There are MANY such cases. As in the above Central Repository example, existence of http endpoints can be intentional, and the world hasn't transitioned to a state where everyone believes that http is always wrong. We've asked about this previously here (see the end of the post) but nobody responded.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =rpbn -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
