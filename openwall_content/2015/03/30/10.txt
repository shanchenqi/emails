Presumably this means there were three cases found by Stefan Roas but the third wasn't exploitable. is for:    - char err[80];   - sprintf(err, "String truncation (SQL_VARYING): attempted to bind %lu octets to column sized %lu"    - char err[80];   - sprintf(err, "String truncation (SQL_TEXT): attempted to bind %lu octets to column sized %lu"  For the third one:    - char err[80];   - sprintf(err, "You have not provided a value for non-nullable parameter #%d.", i);  "You have not provided a value for non-nullable parameter is 80 characters.  Also, the scope of this CVE ID does not include any unreported or later-reported buffer overflows found and fixed by Damyan Ivanov, e.g., ones in the commit.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =fxQK -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
