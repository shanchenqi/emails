Mitigation:     There are several ways you can fix this vulnerability:     1) Upgrade to the latest version of Roller, which is now     2) Or, add the following line to Roller's velocity.properties file:   runtime.introspector.uberspect=org.apache.velocity.util.introspection.SecureUberspector     3) Or, disable template editing on your Roller system by un-checking       the Allow Custom Themes setting in the Server Admin -> Configuration page,       Theme Settings section.
