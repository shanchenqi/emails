The bug entry reads like that there is something that needs fixing:  Attackers can pose as a legit realm (with the same name) so the admin is tricked to join to a rogue AD, allowing an attacker to log into the machine. The admin has no chance to know that he joined an evil AD which has hijacked his legit realm-name. Even when its intentional that the join is automatic for convenience, it should "somehow" be ensured that the legit AD servers are used.
