Programs which call the inet_pton or getaddrinfo function with AF_INET6 or AF_UNSPEC and untrusted address strings are affected. Successful exploitation yields control of the return address. Having enabled stack protector at the application level does not mitigate the issue. All users should patch or upgrade.
