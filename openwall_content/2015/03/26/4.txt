First, "destination" is essentially a reserved keyword, and both Drupal 6 and 7 lacked pre-processing of the original input to eliminate unintended uses of this keyword. As mentioned on the page, 'Many areas of Drupal use a "destination" query string parameter for built-in redirect functionality.' Because "destination" was intended only for this "built-in" use, we feel that it is roughly like a Technology-Specific Special Element in the sense.

Second, there were these separate changes:  > >  Here, the underlying problem is lack of checks for the special "//" initial sequence, which is associated with an external resource. This is roughly like an Input Leader in the sense. Because of the code reorganization between 6 and 7, the code changes are not identical but apparently the goal is to prevent only the "//" attack approach, not other attack approaches. Accordingly, it can be considered the same problem, and the same CVE ID is applicable to both 6 and 7.
