So you're saying Oracle is willing to work with Red Hat and the community in general now? Can we get access to the MySQL security bugs and test cases for example? This would be HUGELY helpful to the community.  I'll believe Oracle is willing to work with the community when I actually see Oracle participate and help the community. Until then it's just words from some random Oracle employee and most likely isn't official policy.  So prove to us you want to work with us (e.g. by opening up the MySQL security bugs/test cases) and we can definitely look at future cooperation.  --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
