If customers want features in RHEL asking on oss-security is not the way to go about it, ask your TAM/GSS.  If vendors want features in their rebranded RHEL they can add them. I have no clue why you would need broad agreement from the community including Red Hat to add a feature to Oracle Linux.  If you lack the engineering talent to add this feature, then at least with RHEL you can become a customer and get support (new features if requested by enough customers obviously become more of a priority but I can't make any promises obviously). Which leads back to the "ask your TAM/GSS" point.
