(Admittedly, CVEs for documentation are infrequent. is one example.)  The essence of the issue is that it's easy for documentation readers to infer that the Basic ACLs section, as well as essentially all of the access-control.sdf file, is suggesting that "access to * by self write" (with no earlier write restrictions) is a typically correct or recommended design. It seems very unlikely that only Debian is facing a related security impact.  On the other hand, if upstream believes that its existing documentation is completely reasonable, then having a CVE for it could be counterproductive.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =/YQE -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
