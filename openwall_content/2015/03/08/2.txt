If so as I said, customer cases carry far > more weight than oss-security for feature requests.   Sorry, I didn’t mean to imply that Red Hat should do this first.   I’m also sorry if this came across as antagonistic: my intention was to try to find a way forward that would be beneficial to us both and to everyone else.  There is no reason at all why I should not do this, but I would rather do it with broad agreement.   There is also absolutely no way this could be done as closed-source and I’m not sure why you think I could or would do that.  If both Red Hat have customer requests then that would help everyone would it not?  jch  >  >> jch >  >  > -- > Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud > PGP A90B 66BF >    Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
