That would have 9 CVE IDs.  I see.  There is a vulnerabilty involving a unique query parameter called 'destination' (i.e. http://example.org/?destination=http://example.com). In Drupal, this parameter may be accessed via $_REQUEST['destination'], $_GET['destination'] or drupal_get_destination() function. That issue affected differently to distinct Drupal versions; for example all confirmation forms in Drupal 7 could be redirected to an external page via the 'destination' parameter directly, but in Drupal 6 only if the code that builds the confirmation form uses the parameter (and there are only a few). The destination parameter was being trusted in multiple places and the fix consisted in filtering it early in Drupal's bootstrap (see This helps preventing open redirections in custom code and contributed modules too. That issue was reported multiple times by different people.  The Drupal 6 fix also included filtering an additional parameter but there was no evidence that some harm could be done with it (I'm not asking a CVE for this)  Additionally, it was detected that Drupal 7 url_is_external() and Drupal 6 menu_path_is_external() API functions could return FALSE for some external URLs. I think these could deserve additional CVE IDs.  These issues were present in Drupal 8 too - the fix has already been committed: - be we currently don't request CVEs for unstable releases of Drupal.
