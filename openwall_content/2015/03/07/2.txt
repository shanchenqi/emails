During checks on our TLS stack, we have discovered two further issues which we have fixed - SSLv2 support, and vulnerability to FREAK. These vulnerabilities affect basically every Mono version ever released.  All three issues should be addressed in the following patches:   These patches should apply to all Mono versions from or so onwards. The EXPORT cipher removal patch requires slight modification in order to apply to Mono releases prior to 3.x - should work for these users. The Impersonation patch requires slight modification to apply to Mono releases prior to 3.4 - should work for these users.  Alternatively, this is fixed in Mono and higher:  Linux and Mac downloads from www.mono-project.com have been updated to - the Windows release will take another day or two.  Below is a (non-exhaustive) list of Mono versions in use in supported distributions, and the patches they require for full coverage.  2.4 branch (Ubuntu - SSLv2 patch, Modified Impersonation patch, Modified FREAK patch (Debian 6, SLES 11) - SSLv2 patch, Modified Impersonation patch, Modified FREAK patch (Fedora 19, 20, 21) - SSLv2 patch, Modified Impersonation patch, Modified FREAK patch (Debian 7, Ubuntu - SSLv2 patch, Modified Impersonation patch, Modified FREAK patch (openSUSE - SSLv2 patch, Modified Impersonation patch, FREAK patch (openSUSE - SSLv2 patch, Modified Impersonation patch, FREAK patch (Debian 8, Ubuntu Gentoo) - SSLv2 patch, Modified Impersonation patch, FREAK patch (Arch) - SSLv2 patch, Impersonation patch, FREAK patch   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
