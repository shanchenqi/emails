This was fixed by ensuring all URLs below /api/ only ever return responses with a content type of application/json, even in the case of an internal server error.  Bug allowed an attacker to specify a URL to /api/definitions which would cause an arbitrary additional header to be returned. This was fixed by stripping out CR/LF from the "download" query string parameter.   Fixed by:  Could CVEs please be assigned to these issue?
