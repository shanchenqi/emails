TLDR: * One or two CVE candidates * Review of proposed fixes wanted * Ideas on realistic attack scenarios welcome   grml-debootstrap [1] is a wrapper around debootstrap written in Bash.   I recently ran into two bugs in grml-debootstrap, documented in detail at the following GitHub issues.   1) For the first    Issues with sourcing cmdlineopts.clp from current working directory   https://github.com/grml/grml-debootstrap/issues/59  I am rather clear about exploitability. Please review the proposed approach for a fix.   2) For the second    Lack of user input escaping / use of $!`"\ in passwords   https://github.com/grml/grml-debootstrap/issues/58  I still wonder about realistic exploitation scenarios.  Since the tool is usually executed by root or using sudo, input from a non-root user would need to make its way into the command line, unfiltered or filtered insufficiently.  It could either be a service like    live-build   http://cgi.build.live-systems.org/cgi-bin/live-build  (they don't call grml-debootstrap, if the code is [2]) or a sudoers config like    user23 ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/grml-debootstrap \     --password * .....  though I am note sure how much of a likely setup that is.  Other ideas on scenarios? Also, please review my proposal on escaping.  Thanks and best,    Sebastian   [1] https://github.com/grml/grml-debootstrap [2] https://packages.debian.org/de/wheezy/live-build  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
