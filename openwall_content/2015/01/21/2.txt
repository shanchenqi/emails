I've already chimed in.  Clearing the Smack label on a file because someone writes to it makes no sense whatsoever. The same with chown. The Smack label is attached to the object, which is a container of data, not the data itself. Smack labels are Mandatory Access Control labels, not Information labels. If that doesn't mean anything to the reader, check out the (withdrawn) DRAFT.  The proposed implementation does not correctly handle either Mandatory Access Control labels or Information labels. The MAC label is *very different* from the setuid bit.  > > e.g. doesn't SELinux already handle this via policy directives? > >   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
