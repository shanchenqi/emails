There have been a couple postings of a similar patch set [1] by Jan Kara, although I don't believe that series addressed chown().  If I am reading the patches correctly, they (correctly) don't affect SELinux or Smack labels; they are just calling the existing security_inode_killpriv() hook, which is only implemented for the capability module to remove the security.capability xattr.
