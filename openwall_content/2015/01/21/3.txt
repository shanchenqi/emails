[...]  First of all, thank you for your work on the Linux kernel!  Going forward, I think it may be better to CC this sort of messages to the kernel-hardening list (like it's been done on some occasions before, see below) rather than to oss-security - and only post summary messages to oss-security, separately (not CC'ed to anywhere else).  And yes, I'd like to see those summaries and occasional status updates in here (if a relevant issue is being discussed on LKML and/or kernel-hardening) - just not entire LKML threads in full detail (which often includes comments on coding style, multiple patch revisions, etc.)  http://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/  oss-security isn't focused on Linux (let alone the kernel) to an extent where having lengthy/multiple LKML threads CC'ed in here would be appropriate, and it's too tough a job for list moderators to choose to let only some of the messages in a thread like this through to the list (besides, if a message in a thread is rejected, this annoys/discourages the sender, and it breaks threading in some archives/MUAs).  The three messages in this thread so far are luckily OK for oss-security as well, but I am concerned about the general practice and where it would lead us.  I suggest that we do let further messages in this thread to oss-security (unless there are too many or they wander too far), but for further occasions please consider the kernel-hardening list (with only summaries and infrequent status updates to be sent to oss-security).  Thanks again,  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
