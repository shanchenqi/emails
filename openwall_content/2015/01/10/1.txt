There were two bugs patched in the latest updates to libpng. The first  bug is an overflow in png_read_IDAT_data, and is triggerable due to  checks on image width that were removed a while ago in libpng branches  1.6.x and 1.5.x. This is the bug against which the following write up  applies: . While fixing this bug, John Bowler found a second, unrelated overflow in  png_combine_row. His mailing list post on that bug is found here:  . It looks  like was assigned against this bug, but attributed to me  by accident. As the fixes to either bug don't fix the other, there are actually two  overflows that need to be tracked for libpng. People backporting changes  should ensure they fix both bugs. Both of these bugs are evidence of a larger issue in libpng 1.6.x and  1.5.x. Those branches allow abnormally large width and height values. On  64-bit platforms, widths and heights of 0x7fffffff are still allowed.  Somewhat smaller, but abnormally large widths, and still very large  heights, are available on 32-bit platforms. The 1.2.x branch only allows  for the safer values. Safe limits can be enabled in these libpng branches with  -DPNG_SAFE_LIMITS_SUPPORTED. These limits are not enabled by default. I very strongly recommend individuals building libpng 1.5.x and 1.6.x  use PNG_SAFE_LIMITS_SUPPORTED. - Alex Eubanks  On PM, cve-assign@...re.org wrote: > >> I am requesting a CVE for a heap-overflow in libpng It's my >> understanding that versions are vulnerable, and  >> according to >> patch notes it looks like some revisions in the 1.5 branch may have been >> affected as well.
