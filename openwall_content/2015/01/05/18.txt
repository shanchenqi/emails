Our disclosure program is currently community driven, and I've taken steps to prevent this from happening to other reports. That is unfortunate and is completely our fault. Now disclosure for assumed active bugs outside of our program is still for sure the wrong thing to do always especially when not accompanied by an email to our security@...crete5.org address. This would've been resolved quickly had it been sent to our security@...crete5.org email, so I'd suggest falling back to that in the future.
