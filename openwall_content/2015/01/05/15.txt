Original advisory in says following:  """ Disclosure time-line 02 November Discovery. 03 November Initial report sent. 11 November Second contact. No response. 09 December Public disclosure. """  I do not know how author of that advisory tried to contact Concrete5. For future cases: https://www.concrete5.org/developers/security/  I only requested CVE for coordination purposes. In this case CVE is used to notify end-users to actually update their software so that they are not affected by this vulnerability. If you want more details please contact me off-list.  Would it be possible for Concrete5 to request CVEs in the future as part of your security disclosure program?  https://people.redhat.com/kseifrie/CVE-OpenSource-Request-HOWTO.html  - --  Henri Salo -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =GYNG -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
