This is a bugfix release for the current stable branch, 1.8.x, adding security hardening to mitigate faulty third-party security policy files such as Please upgrade unless you have a reason to keep using an older branch.  git tag: git branch: dbus-1.8  Security hardening:  • Do not allow calls to UpdateActivationEnvironment from uids other than   the uid of the dbus-daemon. If a system service installs unsafe   security policy rules that allow arbitrary method calls   (such as then this prevents memory consumption and   possible privilege escalation via UpdateActivationEnvironment.    We believe that in practice, privilege escalation here is avoided   by dbus-daemon-launch-helper sanitizing its environment; but   it seems better to be safe.  • Do not allow calls to UpdateActivationEnvironment or the Stats   interface on object paths other than /org/freedesktop/DBus. Some   system services install unsafe security policy rules that allow   arbitrary method calls to any destination, method and interface with   a specified object path; while less bad than allowing arbitrary   method calls, these security policies are still harmful, since   dbus-daemon normally offers the same API on all object paths and   other system services might behave similarly.  Other fixes:  • Add missing initialization so GetExtendedTcpTable doesn't crash on   Windows Vista SP0 (fd.o Илья А.
