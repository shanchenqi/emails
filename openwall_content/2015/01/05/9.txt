While the bugs have the same technical impact - accessing files outside of  an intended directory - the root causes and vulnerability types are  different.  does not handle when symlink destinations point outside  the directory.  is a protection mechanism failure in which an  attempt is made to protect against directory traversal by removing a  leading slash, but not considering that there can be multiple leading  slashes.  ---  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ]  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
