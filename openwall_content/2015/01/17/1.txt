Attackers can also perform spear phishing attacks against web site  visitors by replacing original content of the web site with arbitrary  HTML and script code, perform drive-by-download attacks by injecting  malware into web pages, and bypass existing CSRF protection mechanism.  The vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of input data  passed via the "admin_username" and "admin_password" HTTP GET parameters  to "/[admin]/install.php" script. A remote attacker can trick a  logged-in user to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary  HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website.  Below are two exploitation examples that use the "alert()" JavaScript  function to display "immuniweb" word:   Note, that "[admin]" in the URL is changed by default during MantisBT  installation. Therefore, the attacker must know the location of the  administrative interface in order to perform the attack. However, admin  panel URL can be bruteforced or predicted in many cases.
