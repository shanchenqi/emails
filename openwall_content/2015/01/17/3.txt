A remote unauthenticated attacker can access  the installation script and obtain database access credentials, which  are stored in plain text in hidden form fields.  An attacker can use the following URL to access the page and obtain  database credentials (login and password) in plaintext:  http://mantis/[admin]/install.php?install=4 [^]  Note, that "[admin]" in the URL is changed by default during  installation. Therefore, the attacker must know the location of the  administrative interface in order to perform the attack. However, admin  panel URL can be bruteforced or predicted in many cases.
