A flaw has been identified that allows a local user to jailbreak the environment and gain root access. As noted here:  "The root user is disabled on Red Star, and it doesn’t look like there is a way to enable it. Fortunately, they left a big security hole: the Software Manager (swmng.app), which runs as root through sudo and will install any RPM package, even if unsigned."  Please assign a CVE ID to this issue.  Thanks  David   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
