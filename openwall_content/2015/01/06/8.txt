ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Certain data accessible (via hypercalls) by the domain controlling the execution of a HVM domain is being freed prematurely, leading to the respective memory regions to possibly be read from and written to in ways unexpected by their new owner(s).  IMPACT ======  Malicious or buggy stub domain kernels or tool stacks otherwise living outside of Domain0 can mount a denial of service attack which, if successful, can affect the whole system.  Only domains controlling HVM guests can exploit this vulnerability. (This includes domains providing hardware emulation services to HVM guests.)  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen versions from 4.2 onwards are vulnerable on x86 systems. ARM systems are not vulnerable.  This vulnerability is only applicable to Xen systems using stub domains or other forms of disaggregation of control domains for HVM guests.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only PV guests will avoid this issue.  (The security of a Xen system using stub domains is still better than with a qemu-dm running as an unrestricted dom0 process.  Therefore users with these configurations should not switch to an unrestricted dom0 qemu-dm.)  CREDITS =======  The issue was discovered by Mihai DonÈ›u from Bitdefender who also supplied the fix.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.           xen-unstable, Xen 4.4.x  Xen 4.3.x, Xen 4.2.x  $   $ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  ZrauMNZDuUnjyJxQZEjreGQW/pfUO6IIsR/MOAPRoiyKOmOmSDoRTo7UJucZUgfr =Z+TF -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
