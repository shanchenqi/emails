I found two SQL injection vulnerabilities and a reflecting XSS vulnerability in the content management system Sefrengo v.  They all reside in the administrative backend of the CMS in the following paths of a common installation:  SQL injection vulnerabilities:  http://{TARGET}/backend/main.php?area=con_configcat&idcat=1&idtplconf=0 http://{TARGET}/backend/main.php?area=plug&idclient=1  XSS vulnerability:  http:// {TARGET}/backend/main.php?area=user&idgroup=0&order=&ascdesc=ASC&searchterm=&page=1  The SQL injection vulnerabilities can be exploited via the parameters "idcat" and "idclient". The XSS vulnerability can be exploited via the parameter "searchterm".  Could you please assign a CVE-ID / CVE-IDs for it?  Thank you!
