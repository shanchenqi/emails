Here is the response from Werner:  ---  >> Double free in scd/command.c: >>  Could be triggered due to an out of memory condition or a wrong use of a functions.  Hard to exploit I guess.  >> Double free in sm/minip12.c: >>  That may happen if iconv_open fails.  Memory error or utf-8 not available.  Note that the buffer is allocated in out secure memory and thus the gcry_free() zeroes the memory.  I can't see how this can be exploted but I am not an expert for this. ---    Hopefully that answers the question,   Thanks, --  -- Joshua Rogers <https://internot.info/>   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
