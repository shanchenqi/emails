First of all and as we stated in our advisory on the 9th of December the vulnerabilities were discovered on the 2nd of November to affect (and later on December) which was the the latest version at that time (As downloaded from concrete5.org). The fix on your github was pushed on the 10th of December a day after we published our advisory on FD and Bugtraq. You accuse us of being irresponsible and unprofessional for not disclosing the vulnerabilities to you first and it's not true since we contacted you twice through your security program at HackerOne (Report which hasn't been even "triaged" yet.  I think what's really unprofessional is your inability to monitor your own security programs while putting the blame on people who reach out to you to help you fix your flaws.
