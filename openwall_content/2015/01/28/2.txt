You can add squid, its bundled plugin helpers, squidpurge, and cachemgr.cgi to that list as not vulnerable. gethostbyname() use is protected by filters on remotely provided inputs.  The squidclient tool version 3.0 and older may be vulnerable if the bad value is provided through the command line -l  or -h parameters. This may be a problem for any scripted products using the tool as a backend. Version 3.1 and newer of this tool are not vulnerable.
