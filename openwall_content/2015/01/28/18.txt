The commit does  not appear to be directly related to alloca usage; it concentrates on  setting "malloc_name = true" in gaih_inet().  However, a submitted patch  for Bugzilla   performs includes much more extensive changes to gaih_inet(), modifies  other functions, and omits the "name = p;" logic that is used in  Also, is marked as "closed" and points to which  references which is RH Bug which says "glibc:  stack overflow in getaddrinfo()'s use of alloca()."  ---  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ]  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
