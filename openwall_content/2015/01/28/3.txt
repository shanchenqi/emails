What?!  No idea where this image came from, who created it, or why, or when.  What is absolutely certain is that October 2 has nothing to do with this bug, simply because the first time someone here had the idea of calling it "GHOST" was on Friday evening!

Exactly, thank you!  And if some of you conspiracy theorists need more proof, even SuSE's Bugzilla entry is still referencing the original name of our proof-of-concept (charged-ghbn.c), which appeared in the advisory draft we sent to the linux-distros mailing-list last week:   In the end, some information was leaked before the Coordinated Release Date (which was January 27, at UTC), but it was just a few hours early.  And again, we sincerely apologize.  Please please please, less pointless bickering, more code auditing.
