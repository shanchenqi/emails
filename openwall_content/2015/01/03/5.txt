There are two issues reported as separate bugs to the Debian BTS:  arj: symlink directory traversal:  -  arj: directory traversal via //multiple/leading/slash:  -  Reproducers for both issues are also attached bot the corresponding bugs.  Could you assign CVE(s) for these isues? (Are two ore one appropriate? It is the same reporter and similar kind of issue).
