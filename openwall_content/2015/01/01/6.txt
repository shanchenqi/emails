Usually I ask fordebian graphickmagick to check the code condition. But to my best knowledge they do not backport, except if you ask. So you should try your image on graphicmagick and check if it crash  BTW one patch was not correct please found updated patch queue here:  I have backported to here (not yet fully tested)  And i plan to backport to  Bastien  > Cheers, > Gynvael  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
