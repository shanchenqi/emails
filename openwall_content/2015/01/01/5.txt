The problem is actually in the embedded copy of libmspack, see [1]. Libmspack, a library to provide compression and decompression of some file formats used by Microsoft, is used in many project (or embedded there like also Clamav). This issue can cause a remotely exploitable denial-of-service condition due to clamav thread hanging forever while scanning the file. A patch is available at [2] for libmspack.  Could you please assign a CVE for this issue in libmspack?
