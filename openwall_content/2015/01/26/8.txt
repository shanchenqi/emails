While many of these issues only affect configuration examples or outdated components, some do affect the default configuration.  Initial disclosures:   Upstream issue:  https://github.com/kamailio/kamailio/issues/48  At this point, three issues are well understood:  * The kamctl administrative utility and default configuration would use    /tmp/kamailio_fifo fixed in Debian's kamailio     * The kamcmd administrative utility and default configuration would use    /tmp/kamailio_ctl patch available).  * The kamailio build process would use constant filenames in /tmp    allowing to elevate privileges to the build user    patch available).  The combined patch can be found at:  While the last issue definitely affects the upstream kamailio build, arguably the first two issues are packaging specific. If they are treated as such, it is worth noting that kamailio was never part of a Debian stable release and thus this may not be worth issuing a CVE.  I would like to thank Victor Seva for his timely responses, kind interaction and providing patches for all of these issues.
