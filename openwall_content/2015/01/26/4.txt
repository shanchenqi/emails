For details see: http://www.privoxy.org/  Privoxy contains fixes for the following security issues:  - Fixed a DoS issue in case of client requests with incorrect   chunk-encoded body. When compiled with assertions enabled   (the default) they could previously cause Privoxy to abort().   Reported by Matthew Daley.    - Fixed multiple segmentation faults and memory leaks in the   pcrs code. This fix also increases the chances that an invalid   pcrs command is rejected as such. Previously some invalid commands   would be loaded without error. Note that Privoxy's pcrs sources   (action and filter files) are considered trustworthy input and   should not be writable by untrusted third-parties.    - Fixed an 'invalid read' bug which could at least theoretically   cause Privoxy to crash.    Please assign CVEs for them.  The second issue could potentially affect other programs that use pcrs.c, but I'm not aware of any that do. Privoxy imported the file from the upstream project pcrs (not to be confused with pcre) which is no longer maintained.  The last two issues were partially discovered with afl-fuzz.
