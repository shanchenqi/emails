We have no access to vendor list, thus we had no prior knowledge if the fixes are ready or not.  In our opinion it is related to for couple of reasons. It would be rather pointless to name them all here as someone else still would have a different opinion, understood.  Dunno about the glibc but the bug can be triggered with  So again, the patches exist but the most recent packages are affected.  Many smart and more experienced members of this list may be interested in analyzing this bug. Maybe it's only a regular bug, which can be considered DoS at most in some circumstances or maybe there's more than meets the eye. Hard to tell without in-depth analysis a la Qualys one (by the report one can see how much effort it requires to reach that level of honesty).  Thanks Florian for an initial skim through the code.
