This suggests  two separate bugs.  A test for perl-regexp-refoverflow.diff (regcomp.c) uses:     perl -e  but the code change casts atoi()'s return value to unsigned, whereas the  commit uses different logic that minimizes use of atoi().  ---  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ]  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
