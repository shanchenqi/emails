Given the constraints, I'm assuming that Exim was the only obviously remotely exploitable case that you were able to identify? I'd imagine that you investigated OpenSSH, Apache, other SMTP agents, etc? Would you be willing to publish the list of the reviewed implementations to reduce the amount of repeated work?  /mz  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
