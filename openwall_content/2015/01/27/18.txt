Thank you very much. We also sincerely regret that some information about this vulnerability was leaked a few hours before the Coordinated Release Date (Time, in this particular case).  > you be willing to publish the list of the reviewed implementations to > reduce the amount of repeated work?  Here is a list of potential targets that we investigated (they all call gethostbyname, one way or another), but to the best of our knowledge, the buffer overflow cannot be triggered in any of them:  apache, cups, dovecot, gnupg, isc-dhcp, lighttpd, mariadb/mysql, nfs-utils, nginx, nodejs, openldap, openssh, postfix, proftpd, pure-ftpd, rsyslog, samba, sendmail, sysklogd, syslog-ng, tcp_wrappers, vsftpd, xinetd.  That being said, we believe it would be interesting if other people could have a look, just in case we missed something.
