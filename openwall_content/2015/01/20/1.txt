This probably was introduced by commit in Linux 3.9.  Ciao, Marcus   Input: evdev - fix EVIOCG{type} ioctl  The 'max' size passed into the function is measured in number of bits (KEY_MAX, LED_MAX, etc) so we need to convert it accordingly before trying to copy the data out, otherwise we will try copying too much and end up with up with a page fault.
