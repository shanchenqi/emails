I think these issues in patch also deserve CVEs:  "With a specific file, patch goes to infinite loop and eats all CPU time."  "Got an other issue which output this before segfault: patching file util.h  Ran out of memory using Plan A -- trying again...  patching file util.h Segmentation fault"  "Add line number overflow checking. Based on Robert C. Seacord's INT32-C document for integer overflow checking and Tobias Stoeckmann's "integer overflows and oob memory access" patch for FreeBSD."  Thank you!  --  Martin PrpiÄ / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
