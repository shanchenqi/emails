Actually, I worked it out:  if you edit the isinsets function,  with this:          register unsigned uc = (unsigned char)c;         printf("ncols: %d\n", ncols);          for (i = 0, col = g->setbits; i < ncols; i++, col += g->csetsize) {         printf("inside isinsets2: %d\n", col[uc]);                  if (col[uc] != 0)                         return(1);         }  you'll see  that 'isinsets' is false on a normal run of ereg(which is extended POSIX regex by default) and when running ereg, it'll printf 'ncols: 0' constantly.  I don't know how 'sets' are done in PHP ereg, however.
