When   a signal is triggered while the process is within a non   async-signal-safe function the signal handler will call a non   sync-signal-safe function too. POSIX specifies the behaviour in this   situation as undefined. Dependend on involved functions, libraries,   and operating system, the process can continue, freeze, or crash.   Mostly this issue occurs when socat is in listening mode with fork   option and a couple of child processes terminate at the same time.
