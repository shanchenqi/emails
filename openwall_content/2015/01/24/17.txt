They are planning on fixing it in the next release.  The fix is simply modifying apache’s ports.conf to bind apache to localhost.  # cat ports.conf |grep -n 8:NameVirtualHost 9:Listen  Actually one of the fastest vendor responses I’ve ever seen. :-)   > On Jan 24, at PM, Larry W.

Perhaps they just default to root root as that's a very common password combo for mysql installs?
