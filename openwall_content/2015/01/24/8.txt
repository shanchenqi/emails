However, we're planning to keep the distinct IDs of and We don't combine issues based only on finding that they affect the same module and have the same impact, and were fixed at roughly the same time. The example of loading 'vfat(blowfish)' is new attack information that wasn't obvious, and didn't become public until 20 months later.  (In this type of situation, we would prefer two CVE IDs even if everything had been fixed in a single commit. Admittedly, if there were a single commit, and no other information were posted, it might have been much harder to notice that there were two discoveries. So, there might have been the less preferable outcome of one CVE ID.)  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =/VtB -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
