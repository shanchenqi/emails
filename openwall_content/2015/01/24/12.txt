The code branch is where this:        if (cflags&REG_EXTENDED)  is true. will lead to the null pointer deference  so this gets executed:                p_ere(p, OUT);   rather than the p_str(as stated):        else if (cflags&REG_NOSPEC)                p_str(p);   ereg is deprecated as of (http://php.net/manual/en/function.ereg.php), and there doesn't seem to be that much documentation on it, so it's hard to make a reproducer.   However,  79 = #define      REG_EXTENDED     this gives a clue as to why it probably hasn't been caught before.  "REG_EXTENDED", according to the regex(3) manual, is for "POSIX Extended Regular Expression syntax"  which probably isn't that common.   But, I do welcome an independent review.
