Upstream references: - libtiff: Divide By Zero in the tiffdither tool   - libtiff: Out-of-bounds Read in the thumbnail tool   - libtiff: Out-of-bounds Read in the tiff2bw tool   - libtiff: Out-of-bounds Read in the tiff2rgba tool   - libtiff: Out-of-bounds Read & Write in the tiff2pdf tool   - libtiff: Out-of-bounds Read & Write in the tiff2pdf tool   - libtiff: Out-of-bounds Write in the thumbnail tool   - libtiff: Out-of-bounds Write in the tiffdither tool   - libtiff: Out-of-bounds Write in the tiffdither tool   - libtiff: Out-of-bounds Write in the tiffdither tool   - libtiff: Out-of-bounds Write in the thumbnail and tiffcmp tools   - libtiff: Out-of-bounds Write in the tiff2pdf tool   - libtiff: Out-of-bounds Read in the tiff2ps and tiffdither tools   - libtiff: Out-of-bounds Read in the tiffmedian tool   - libtiff: Out-of-bounds Write in the thumbnail and tiffcmp tools   - libtiff: Out-of-bounds Read in the tiffset tool   - libtiff: Out-of-bounds Writes in the tiffdither tool    All the crashes were discovered with the help of afl (http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/).  Advisories: -   -   -   -    This was tested on Ubuntu LTS (amd64) LibTIFF .  Last stable LibTIFF source release is also affected.  Upstream CVS HEAD contains fixes for all bugs except the following: - libtiff: Out-of-bounds Write in the thumbnail and tiffcmp tools   - libtiff: Out-of-bounds Read in the tiffset tool   - libtiff: Out-of-bounds Writes in the tiffdither tool    Please accept my apologies for the mishandling of this report. I did not conform to the distros list policy regarding embargo time enforcement and I failed to notify oss-security before creating bug reports on public upstream's Bugzilla. Clearly, notifying the distros list before upstream was not the way to go. I take full responsibility for this.
