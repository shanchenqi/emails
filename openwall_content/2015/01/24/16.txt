These affect the library itself and would also impact uses within ImageMagick, etc.  http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/vulns/libtiff-mem2.tif    - uninitialized memory in putcontig8bitCIELab / TIFFCIELabToXYZ     I'm guesisng this is a dupe of  http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/vulns/libtiff-cvs-1.tif    - uninitialized memory in     Fixed in:         Even Rouault  <even.rouault@...tialys.com>        * libtiff/tif_getimage.c: in OJPEG case, fix checks on strile width/height         in the and         cases.      I don't think this had a CVE number assigned yet.  http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/vulns/libtiff-cvs-2.tif    - uninitialized memory in NeXTDecode     Fixed in:         Even Rouault  <even.rouault@...tialys.com>        * libtiff/tif_next.c: add new tests to check that we don't read outside of       the compressed input stream buffer.      I don't think this had a CVE number assigned yet.  http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/vulns/libtiff5.tif    - another use of uninitialized memory in NeXTDecode after fixing the previous case.     I don't think this had a CVE number assigned yet.  The communications with upstream have been spotty, which is probably in part because many people are submitting crash reports at once. I don't know when they plan the next release, and the commits often aren't flagged as security-relevant or credited to any particular report or reporter.  Anyway, the bottom line is that for now, using the last stable version of libtiff on anything attacker-controlled is probably a bad idea.  /mz  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
