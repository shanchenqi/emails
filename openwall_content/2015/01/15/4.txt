An attacker could take this signed message, and replay it "From" you with a changed subject line to try to indicate that you think some other bug was fixed in some other piece of software, version  You can avoid this kind of problem by ensuring that the messages you sign are context-independent (e.g. including the information currently in this message's subject line in your message body directly as well).
