Our interpretation is that the bug reports are actually describing correct and intended behavior. Similarly, the patch seems to break some realistic uses of the mod_remoteip module. The patch is only useful for sites that have chosen to list a trusted proxy that isn't actually trusted.  For example, says:     1. send a request with spoofed X-Forwarded-For header.      X-Forwarded-For:    2. Proxy/Load append the client IP address to    existing X-Forwarded-For header.      X-Forwarded-For:    3. Apache server receive forwarded request.      (httpd.conf)        RemoteIPHeader X-Forwarded-For        RemoteIPTrustedProxy        I expected that mod_remoteip would override client IP with    because is trusted    and is not trusted. Actually, client IP was overridden with   Here, is trusted to present ANY public IP address, including both and is NOT, for example, trusted to present a private IP address such as The documentation says "It is critical to only enable this behavior from intermediate hosts (proxies, etc) which are trusted by this server, since it is trivial for the remote useragent to impersonate another useragent." In other words, the operator of the Apache HTTP Server has delegated to the responsibility for sending an X-Forwarded-For header that is valid according to the rule set established by the configuration. Only the configuration can determine whether is trusted to send an "X-Forwarded-For: header. The bug reports seem to envision a world in which the Apache HTTP Server configuration has information about the proxy-trust rule sets of the entire outside world. The documentation does not state that it should have that information, and (from a network-architecture perspective) it really wouldn't make much sense for it to have that information.  The documentation says "Processing halts when a given useragent IP address is not trusted to present the preceding IP address." This is perhaps confusing because the available directives don't provide any way to express a rule about whether a specific N-hops-away external IP address is allowed to present any specific (N+1)-hops-away external IP address. The directives are only about the Apache HTTP Server's trust of 1-hop-away external IP addresses.  It seems plausible that the documentation means that these two types of halts were thought to be desirable:  1. If the Apache HTTP Server is communicating directly with a host, and that host is specified in neither a RemoteIPTrustedProxy nor a RemoteIPInternalProxy directive, then processing halts at the right-most IP address in the X-Forwarded-For header. Here, the goal of the halt is to reject an unauthorized proxy.  2. If the Apache HTTP Server is communicating directly with a host, and that host is specified in a RemoteIPTrustedProxy directive but not in a RemoteIPInternalProxy directive, then processing halts at the right-most private IP address in the X-Forwarded-For header. For example:    X-Forwarded-For:  halts at From a network-architecture perspective, this seems to make perfect sense because the meaning of with respect to host can be completely different from the meaning of on the intranet of the Apache HTTP Server. Here, the goal of the halt is to reject an out-of-context intranet address.   In other words, we believe that the bug report's expectation of "mod_remoteip would override client IP with because is trusted and is not trusted" is false. From the perspective of directly incoming IP packets to the Apache HTTP Server, is neither trusted nor untrusted. A trust decision is outside the scope of what the Apache HTTP Server can or should do. The trust decision belongs exclusively to the operator of  If all of this is wrong, and mod_remoteip actually wanted to have complete information about the proxy-trust rule sets of the outside world, then security@...che.org (see the http://www.apache.org/security/committers.html page) can assign a CVE ID.  - --  CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority M/S Burlington Road, Bedford, MA USA [ PGP key available through http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (SunOS)  =oDAH -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
