There's probably no better evidence for the severe usability issues pgp-based mail has than people on a mailing list of IT security specialists explaining each other how to properly use it :-)  Having said that: I have a rough kind-of-proposal to fix exactly that problem. I think pgp not encrypting/signing the subject is one of its major usability fails. I'll send my ideas to the gpg dev list soon, will post a link here when done. Let's see if we can at least fix that.  --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
