Sure, it's based on some open-source software, it wouldn't be a linux  distribution otherwise. But is it open source itself? Actually, I'm not  sure what does this mean exactly but it's the second distro brought to  oss-security recently (the first one was Red Star) which seems to be  more appropriate for full-disclosure than for oss-security.  But maybe it's just me...  --  Alexander Cherepanov  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
