Original advisory:  """ 1) Authentication bypass The plugin does not correctly check if the user is logged in. Certain code can be called without authentication  2) Arbitrary file upload The plugin code does not validate the host in the provided download URL, which allows to upload malicious files, including PHP code.  3) Path Traversal Certain values are not sanitized before they are used in a file operation. This allows to store files outside of the "download" folder.   4) Cross Site Scripting (XSS) The generated author link uses unsanitized user values which can be abused for Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
