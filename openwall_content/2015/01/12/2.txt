I found a reflecting XSS vulnerability in the filemanager of the CMS Croogo v.  The filemanager is located here in a common Croogo installation:  http://  By appending arbitrary HTML- and/or JavaScriptcode to names of existing files, the XSS gets executed. However it does not work by appending the code to names of directories.  Example:  in filemanager functionality of CMS Croogo  Could you please assign a CVE-ID for that issue?  Thank you!
