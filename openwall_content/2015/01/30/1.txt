It's very mixed, sometimes I get CVEs quickly, sometimes I don't get answers to requests.  I would like the CVE process to be a better tool to organize this (as I've written in my blog post), but right now I feel it's not working reliably enough for that. At some point I stopped caring too much about CVEs because I felt waiting for them stops me from reporting more issues.   cu, --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
