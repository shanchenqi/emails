I don't know about RHEL, but Debian's security tracker does actually try to do this, and to coordinate it with the CVEs.  For example:    https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/php5  It ain't pretty, but it's there.  If you (or anyone) is interested in working on this sort of tracker, or integrating between this and other trackers, please talk to the debian security team:    https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Security  Regards,        --dkg  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
