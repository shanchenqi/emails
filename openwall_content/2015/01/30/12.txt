IRC servers can consider using CACert.org or their own CA and adding that to clients; Let's Encrypt seems to be making progress too, so this problem will hopefully solve itself in a few months. That shouldn't be a reason to ship a broken TLS implementation.  > I don't think this is a security bug with hexchat > more a symptom of the fact that SSL combines encryption and identity > verification where sometimes people only want the former.  What's the point of encryption without identity verification, anyway? MITM attacks are laughably trivial there.  >  > On Thu Jan 29 at AM Marc Deslauriers < > marc.deslauriers@...onical.com> wrote: >  >> On PM, Vincent Danen wrote: >>> As reported [1]: >>> >>> XChat did not verify that the server hostname matched the domain name in >> the >>> subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field in >> certificates.
