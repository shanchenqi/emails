IMO, no one should ever wait for a CVE before reporting an > issue!  Okay, maybe this was prone to misinterpretation.  I thought it more like "If I try to track all the issues where I have requested CVEs and check whether I really got them or whether I should ask again I'd loose time I could better use to fuzz the next library." I don't remember actively delaying reporting or publication of a vuln due to lack of CVEs.  --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
