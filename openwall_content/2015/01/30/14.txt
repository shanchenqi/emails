It does not necessarily indicate any relevance to GHOST.  If you try upgrading glibc and the issue goes away, _that_ would be a reason to suspect relevance.  OTOH, if the issue persists even with GHOST-patched glibc, that would be a reason to think it's an unrelated issue (which most likely it is).  Can you perform this test maybe? Don't forget to restart Dovecot after the glibc upgrade.  As to use of the mailing list, I'd prefer no screenshots, pastebins, etc. in here.  Instead, post the information in plain text form right in here.
