IMO, no one should ever wait for a CVE before reporting an issue!  If it is possible to get a CVE assigned during an embargo period that would exist anyway, and without disclosing the vulnerability detail to any extra party, great!  (e.g. this happens for issues handled via the distros list, where CVEs are currently getting assigned from Red Hat's pool without having to inform any extra party.)  If this is not possible, then do without CVE (and one may be assigned when the issue is already public in here).
