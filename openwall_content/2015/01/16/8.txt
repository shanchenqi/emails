It's doing exactly what you asked of it.  Could you please elaborate? Citing my email to upstream:  "--no-absolute-filenames option seems to be intended to limit extracting  contents of an archive to be strictly inside a current directory (it  guards against both absolute paths and relative paths with .. in them).  However it can be bypassed with symlinks [extracted from the archive]."  --  Alexander Cherepanov  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
