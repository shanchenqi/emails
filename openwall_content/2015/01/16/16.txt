In order to ensure full traceability, we need a CVE number assigned that we can attach to further notifications. This issue is already public, although an advisory was not sent yet.  Title: Glance user storage quota bypass Reporter: Tushar Patil (NTT) Products: Glance Versions: up to and version up to  Description: Tushar Patil from NTT reported a vulnerability in Glance. By deleting images that are being uploaded, a malicious user can overcome the storage quota and thus may overrun the backend. Images in deleted state are not taken into account by quota and won't be effectively deleted until the upload is completed. Only Glance setups configured with user_storage_quota are affected.
