After all it's your company that's selling a product that makes the promise to backport important security fixes for years.  I think we have a real problem here and I'd like to have a talk how to solve it. Debian, Redhat, Ubuntu and many others are making an implicit promise with their long time supported stable distributions that they'll take care of important bugs. I have big doubts how capable they are in delivering that promise. There are just too many bugs to take care of.  I'll write up something longer on that topic later today.  And yes: I'd like people to cry alarm every time they see a buffer overflow in glibc or any other core lib. Even if we aren't capable of deeply checking every one of them: Having the information available somewhere else than depply hidden in a google bugtracker would be an improvement. If it is too much for this list create another place for it.  --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
