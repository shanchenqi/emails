There now appear to be two different requests for two separate Bugzilla  IDs that might be discussing the same issue.  Please clarify.  BZ is "glibc: Invalid-free when using getaddrinfo()".

(A year is not used because  does not clearly identify any security relevance.)  A separate Bugzilla ID, might be a duplicate.
