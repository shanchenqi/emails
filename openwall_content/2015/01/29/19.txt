The short version is:  HAProxy is NOT vulnerable to GHOST.  The slightly longer version is:  we are looking for gethostbyname() calls whose hostname argument can be controlled by an attacker.  There are indeed a few calls to gethostbyname() in HAProxy, but their hostname arguments all depend on the configuration file, in the end, so they are safe (side note: there is getaddrinfo() support too, but it seems to be turned on for Solaris only, by default).  Hope this is useful.
