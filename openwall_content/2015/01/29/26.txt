I do not have access to either of the private upstream bugs to know if any resource consumption attacks are mentioned there.  My understanding is that the fix aims to ensure that lengths / operands / indexes do not exceed  I'm guessing, but complexity may refer to exceeding the limit with short patterns as well.  This issue was fixed in the same Chrome update or short patterns cause generation of invalid opcodes because of operands exceeding   > This leads to a possibility of these two observations: >  >   A. the entire known vulnerability is that the unpatched code >      calculates certain values without ensuring that they can be >      represented in a 24-bit field >  >   B. the vendor has not stated whether there is a vulnerability >      related solely to the concept of complexity.

This may not be perfect, but still significant improvement from having this grouped with 30+ other, likely unrelated, issues under single CVE.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Product Security  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
