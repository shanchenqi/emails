In addition to this, even when advisories are written, there are incentives to game the system. Some have an incentive to overhype issues, others to make them go away, and yet others make the world worse by comparing the security of products by counting CVEs.  This kind of sucks, but I'm not sure how can we fix this in a practical way. The best approach may be to release and push out new versions of packages far more aggressively, without trying to identify and cherry-pick security updates. This also means causing a lot more breakage, but maybe that's OK.  /mz  PS. A good chunk of the bugs linked to via http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/ probably don't have CVEs assigned, probably including most of the security-relevant ones here: https://udd.debian.org/cgi-bin/bts-usertags.cgi?user=jwilk@debian.org&tag=afl . I actually tried to ping cve-assign@ about the libtiff bugs, but they didn't get back to me.
