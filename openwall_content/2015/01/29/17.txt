I'm not on any closed list either, but I agree chrome os people probably should be on the distros list :-) I think Solar Designer is the responsible person that manages this.  On the alarm crying it depends. In this case it already was pretty much public, so forwarding the info here would be appropriate I think. I assume that's also true for all too-minor-to-worry-too-much-issues. If these become too much we can always think about another public "post minor maybe-security-issues-here"-mailing-list. But a lot of minor issues get posted here already and I think people are fine with it right now.  --  Hanno Bรถck http://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
