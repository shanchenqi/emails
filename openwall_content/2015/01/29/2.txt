An internal bug report was filed on when a Googler noticed that (with a zeros) resulted in a buffer overflow detected by address sanitizer.  I didn't investigate whether the bug is exploitable or not (I just assume that all buffer overflows should be patched). I simply noticed that upstream has already fixed the issue, and so we backported the patch as we routinely do for other buffer overflows.  Chromium team also got notified about the internal bug, and applied the patch as well.  If I was supposed to cry alarm, I would have to cry alarm every time there is a buffer overflow in glibc, which doesn't seem very useful.
