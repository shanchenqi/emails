This ID (and others) used a date because the bug report was  technically public in  The year portion of a CVE ID typically  reflects when the CVE was requested for non-public issues; or for  already-public issues, the year portion typically reflects the year of  disclosure.  The disclosure date itself can be a subject of  interpretation, such as when an issue is disclosed at a  publicly-accessible URL but only likely to be noticed by a limited  audience ("technically public") versus when the issue becomes "widely  public" to the infosec industry.  Especially in the transition from the end of one year to the beginning of  the next year, there can be a mixture of dates.  Also, CVE (and every  other vulnerability "database" or repository) frequently add entries for  earlier years.  Accordingly, there is still a chance that  IDs will reach 5 digits, either in or later, as we continue to cover  older issues that we discover or did not prioritize in earlier years.  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
