There is currently no CVE ID for this. The practice that we follow is not the same for every piece of software. For example, in the past we have assigned CVE IDs for vulnerabilities in FFmpeg that did not affect any FFmpeg release. The rationale for this is that Google was incorporating unreleased FFmpeg code into Chrome. In the case of PHP, we do not know of (for example) current cases in which a Linux distribution ships packages based on using the PHP master tree at an arbitrary point in time. Also, we have not seen PHP maintainers advertise that end users should individually use master. Accordingly, for PHP, master seems to not directly correspond to a "product," and at least some of the bugs are a reflection of the code being in an indeterminate development state.
