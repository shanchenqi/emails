This also means there will be no changes  needed to previously assigned CVE-IDs, which all include 4 digits.  The rule is:  - 4 digits until - 5 digits until - 6 digits until - 7 digits starting with  CVEs can still get assigned by the rules, so they will slowly creep up a bit still. But in general new issues will now get CVEs.
