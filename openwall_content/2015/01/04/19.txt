We will still issue at least one valid 5-digit ID, and  probably more, on January 13.  This is a one-time exception to our usual  sequential allocation process.  We are doing this as a final "test" to  ensure that CVE-using implementations can handle the syntax change.  We might also issue CVE IDs with more than 5 digits, since it is highly  likely that some implementations will make a 5-digit assumption, even  though an arbitrary number of digits is allowed by the syntax change,  which went into effect more than a year ago.
