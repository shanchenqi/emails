I found multiple reflecting/stored XSS- and SQLi-vulnerabilities as well as an unrestricted file upload in the CMS ferretCMS which is currently in the alpha development stage.  ============ Reflecting XSS ============  http://  ============ Stored XSS ============  1. via login-form of the administrative backend, input field for username:  http://{TARGET}/admin.php  executed here in the logevent functionality in the backend:  http://{TARGET}/admin.php?type=log&action=read  2.  via the new blog-post form, input field for pagetitle:  http://{TARGET}/admin.php?type=page&action=insert&p=  executed, for example, here:  http://{TARGET}/admin.php?type=page&action=read  ============ SQLi ============  http://  http://  http://  http://  http://  http://  http://  ================== Unrestricted file upload ==================  An administrator has the opportunity to upload arbitrary files via a form located here on a common ferretCMS installation:  http://{TARGET}/admin.php?type=uploader&action=upload  As these files aren't renamed and stored in the following location, any unauthenticated user is able to read/execute those files, too:  http://{TARGET}/custom/uploads/{NAME_OF_THE_FILE}    Could you please assign a CVE-ID / CVE-IDs for these issues.  Thank you very much!  Greetings.
