Include a check on the length of the digit string, and if greater than 9 digits, assume it can never be a valid backref (obviating the need for the atoi() call).  I've also simplified the code a bit, putting most of the \g handling code into a single block, rather than doing multiple "if (isg) {...}".  PoC:  perl -e  not sure if this can be exploited at all, but someone creative maybe has ideas, if so this may need a CVE.  --  Kurt Seifried -- Red Hat -- Product Security -- Cloud PGP A90B 66BF   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
