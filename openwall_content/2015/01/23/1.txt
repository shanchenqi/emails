I'd like to request a CVE for an issue brought up on this list on Jan 17th  I did not see one created for this issue titled:  "Re: [RFC PATCH RESEND] vfs: Move security_inode_killpriv() after permission checks"   This issue can be classified as a denial of service.  Example:  [wmealing]$ ping -c1  www.google.com PING www.google.com bytes of data. 64 bytes from icmp_seq=1 ttl=51 ms --- www.google.com ping statistics --- 1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms rtt min/avg/max/mdev = ms  [wmealing]$ chown root:root /usr/bin/ping chown: changing ownership of â/usr/bin/pingâ: Operation not permitted  [wmealing]$ ping www.google.com ping: icmp open socket: Operation not permitted  This can cause a denial of service for applications which use the capabilities subsystem such as pirahnah (arping), netconsole (arping), some kdump implementations, etc.  Thank you.
