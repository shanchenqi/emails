The user can specify any path, and the server will write to it with no validation. This could be used to perform a range of attacks. For example, a critical file could be overwritten, thereby disabling the defense4all server. On Windows servers, a UNC path could be injected, potentially causing the server to write data to remote filesystems. An attacker cannot control the contents of the file, but they can define a report query that returns no results, and therefore force it to write an empty file. An error message is received if the server cannot write to the provided path. An attacker could therefore use this issue to map out the writable filesystem on the server and potentially perform more advanced attacks by manipulating special files in the /dev and /proc filesystems of Linux servers.  It was also found that defense4all was using Spring RC3. This component is vulnerable to a number of vulnerabilities as listed on the pivotal advisories page: http://www.pivotal.io/security Full details including how to apply a patch are available on the OpenDaylight security advisories page:  https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Security_Advisories  Thanks David Jorm on behalf of the OpenDaylight security response team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
