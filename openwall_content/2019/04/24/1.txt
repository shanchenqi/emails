However, if a node receives a request for a collection it does not host, it proxies the request to a relevant node and serves the request. Solr bypasses all authorization settings for such requests. This affects all Solr versions that uses the default authorization mechanism of Solr (RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin)  Mitigation: A fix is provided in Solr 7.7 version and upwards. If you use Solr's authorization mechanism, please upgrade to a version newer than Solr 7.7.  Credit: This issue was discovered by Mahesh Kumar Vasanthu Somashekar.
