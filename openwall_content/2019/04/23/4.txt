This means that an undetected man in the middle attack could be constructed if an attacker can arrange to intercept TLS traffic.  Versions 0.9 - are affected when using OpenSSL prior to This includes the Qpid Proton C library, and all language binding libraries using it. Installations using the native Windows Schannel TLS implementation or using OpenSSL or later are not affected.  Note that this attack will not work if client certificate authentication is in use as anonymous ciphers cannot be used in this case.  Resolution: Anyone using an affected version with OpenSSL prior to should upgrade their installation to or higher for fix to this vulnerability.  Credit: This issue was identified by the Qpid developers.
