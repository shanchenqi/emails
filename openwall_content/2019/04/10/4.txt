This was caused by missing state validation steps when processing the SAE confirm message in hostapd/AP mode.  Similar cases against the wpa_supplicant SAE station implementation had already been tested by the hwsim test cases, but those sequences did not trigger this specific code path in AP mode which is why the issue was not discovered earlier.  An attacker in radio range of an access point using hostapd in SAE configuration could use this issue to perform a denial of service attack by forcing the hostapd process to terminate.   Vulnerable versions/configurations  All hostapd versions with SAE support (CONFIG_SAE=y in the build configuration and SAE being enabled in the runtime configuration).   Possible mitigation steps  - Merge the following commit to hostapd and rebuild:    SAE: Fix confirm message validation in error cases    These patches are available from  - Update to hostapd v2.8 or newer, once available  --  Jouni Malinen                                            PGP id  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
