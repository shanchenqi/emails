The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * Ansible Tower Plugin * Aqua MicroScanner Plugin * Azure AD Plugin * GitHub Authentication Plugin * SiteMonitor Plugin 0.6 * Static Analysis Utilities Plugin  Additionally, these plugin have security vulnerabilities that have been made public, but have no releases containing a fix yet:  * Koji Plugin * Self-Organizing Swarm Plug-in Modules Plugin * Twitter Plugin  Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  / (CSRF) and (permission check) Static Analysis Utilities Plugin has the capability to allow other plugins to  display trend graphs for their static analysis results. Static Analysis  Utilities Plugin provides the configuration form for the default settings of  each graph.  The configuration form and form submission handler did not perform a  permission check, allowing attackers with Job/Read access to change the  per-job graph configuration defaults for all users.  Additionally, the form submission handler did not require POST requests,  resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.  Static Analysis Utilities Plugin now requires Job/Configure permission and  POST requests to configure the per-job graph defaults for all users.   / SiteMonitor Plugin unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate validation for  the entire Jenkins master JVM.  SiteMonitor Plugin no longer does that. Instead, it now has an opt-in option  to ignore SSL/TLS errors for each site check individually.   / Self-Organizing Swarm Plug-in Modules Plugin allows clients to auto-discover  Jenkins instances on the same network through a UDP discovery request.  Responses to this request are XML documents.  Self-Organizing Swarm Plug-in Modules Plugin does not configure the XML parser  in a way that would prevent XML External Entity (XXE) processing. This allows  unauthenticated attackers on the same network to have Swarm clients parse a  maliciously crafted XML response that uses external entities to read arbitrary  files from the Swarm client or denial-of-service attacks.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   (1) / (CSRF) and (permission check) Ansible Tower Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method  implementing form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access to  Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified  credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored  in Jenkins.  Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests,  resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.  This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer  permissions.   (2) / Ansible Tower Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow  users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.  This functionality did not check permissions, allowing any user with  Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those could be  used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another  vulnerability.  An enumeration of credentials IDs in this plugin now requires  Overall/Administer permission.   / Azure AD Plugin stored the client secret unencrypted in the global config.xml  configuration file on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed by  users with access to the master file system.  Azure AD Plugin now stores the client secret encrypted.   / Twitter Plugin stores credentials unencrypted in its global configuration file  on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed by users with access  to the master file system.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / Koji Plugin unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate validation for the  entire Jenkins master JVM.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / GitHub Authentication Plugin did not manage the state parameter of OAuth to  prevent CSRF. This allowed an attacker to catch the redirect URL provided  during the authentication process using OAuth and send it to the victim. If  the victim was already connected to Jenkins, their Jenkins account would be  attached to the attackerâs GitHub account.  The state parameter is now correctly managed.   / Aqua MicroScanner Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in its global  configuration file on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed by  users with access to the master file system.  Aqua MicroScanner Plugin now stores credentials encrypted.
