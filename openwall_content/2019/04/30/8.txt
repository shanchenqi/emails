It is possible to write files to the archiva server at arbitrary locations by using the artifact upload mechanism.  Existing files can be overwritten, if the archiva run user has appropriate permission on the filesystem for the target file.  Mitigation:   It is highly recommended to upgrade to Archiva or higher, where additional validations are implemented to prevent such malicious parameter values.   As intermediate action you may reduce the number of users that are allowed to upload to archiva and make sure, that the archiva run user may have only    write permission to the directories needed.
