The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * Azure PublisherSettings Credentials Plugin 1.5 * GitLab Plugin * jira-ext Plugin 0.9 * ontrack Jenkins Plugin  Additionally, these plugin have security vulnerabilities that have been made public, but have no releases containing a fix yet:  * XebiaLabs XL Deploy Plugin  Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  / (CSRF) and (permission check) GitLab Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing  form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to  connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials  IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.  Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests,  resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.   / jira-ext Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in its global configuration  file hudson.plugins.jira.JiraProjectProperty.xml on the Jenkins master.  These credentials could be viewed by users with access to the master file  system.   / Azure PublisherSettings Credentials Plugin stored the service management  certificate unencrypted in credentials.xml on the Jenkins master. These  credentials could be viewed by users with access to the master file system.   / (CSRF) and (permission check) A missing permission check in a form validation method in XebiaLabs XL  Deploy Plugin allows users with Overall/Read permission to initiate a  connection test to an attacker-specified server with attacker-specified  credentials.  Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests,  resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.   / ontrack Jenkins Plugin supports sandboxed Groovy expressions. Its sandbox  protection could be circumvented during parsing, compilation, and script  instantiation by providing a crafted Groovy script.  This allowed users able to control the pluginâs job-specific configuration  to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins  master.
