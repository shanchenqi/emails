In that, L1  guest could access L0's APIC register values via L2 guest, when 'virtualize  x2APIC mode' is enabled.  A guest could use this flaw to potentially crash the host kernel resulting in  DoS issue.  Upstream patches: -----------------    ->    ->  This issue was discovered by Marc Orr of Google Inc.
