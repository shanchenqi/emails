Donenfeld" <Jason@...c4.com> To: oss-security <oss-security@...ts.openwall.com> Subject: DLL injection in Go <  Hey folks,  Golang before linked against various DLLs that were same-directory injectable and generally its library loading mechanism did not use LoadLibraryEx, allowing the classic DLL injection attacks, especially with regards to executables saved to the Downloads/ folder [1]. It was assigned and fixed in [2] and [3]. It wasn't mentioned in the release notes, so I'm mentioning it here instead.
