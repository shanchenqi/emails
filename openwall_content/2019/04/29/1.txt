If you actually use the Siemens line discipline for talking to Programmable Logic Controllers, or something like that, you may want to reach out to gregkh and help test things - see the commit message.  == missing locking between ELF coredump code and userfaultfd VMA modification ==  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
