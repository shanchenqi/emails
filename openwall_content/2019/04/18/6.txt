This could result in process termination due to NULL pointer dereference.  An attacker in radio range of a station device with wpa_supplicant network profile enabling use of EAP-pwd could cause the wpa_supplicant process to terminate by constructing unexpected sequence of EAP messages. An attacker in radio range of an access point that points to hostapd as an authentication server with EAP-pwd user enabled in runtime configuration (or in non-WLAN uses of EAP authentication as long as the attacker can send EAP-pwd messages to the server) could cause the hostapd process to terminate by constructing unexpected sequence of EAP messages.   Vulnerable versions/configurations  All hostapd and wpa_supplicant versions with EAP-pwd support (CONFIG_EAP_PWD=y in the build configuration and EAP-pwd being enabled in the runtime configuration) are vulnerable against the process termination (denial of service) attack.   Possible mitigation steps  - Merge the following commits to wpa_supplicant/hostapd and rebuild:    EAP-pwd peer: Fix reassembly buffer handling   EAP-pwd server: Fix reassembly buffer handling    These patches are available from  - Update to wpa_supplicant/hostapd v2.8 or newer, once available  --  Jouni Malinen                                            PGP id  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
