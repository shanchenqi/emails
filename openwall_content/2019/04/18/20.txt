If you look at the original commit that added the pointer masking logic to the kernel in the release: ("printk: hash addresses printed with %p")  it points out that there are currently about different uses of this in the kernel at the time, so the proper way to "fix" this is to just make it so %p does not print out the pointer address.  Today, I responded to one patch that the author sent to the stable mailing list with the following message: 	I suggest, if you really care about this issue in your kernel tree, that you just backport these pointer 	printk patches and be done with it.  That's too big of a change 	to accept into the LTS kernel, but as the lifespan for running on a "general purpose" system is probably only a 	few more months at most, I would recomment just using 	instead as this isn't an issue at all there.  So in short, use or newer if you care about this issue.  If you rely on an older kernel, please backport the above patch, and a few others, to your kernel and be done with the issue.  That's what Android has done, so all of those devices do not have this issue anymore either.  thanks,  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
