Solution status: Fixed by Vendor Fixed version: Vendor notification: Solution date: Public disclosure: CVE reference: CVSS: 7.5 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) Â  Vulnerability Details: JSON encoder in Dovecot 2.3 incorrecty assert-crashes when encountering invalid UTF-8 characters. This can be used to crash dovecot in two ways. Attacker can repeatedly crash Dovecot authentication process by logging in using invalid UTF-8 sequence in username. This requires that auth policy is enabled. Crash can also occur if OX push notification driver is enabled and an email is delivered with invalid UTF-8 sequence in From or Subject header. In 2.2, malformed UTF-8 sequences are forwarded "as-is", and thus do not cause problems in Dovecot itself. Target systems should be checked for possible problems in dealing with such sequences. See https://wiki.dovecot.org/Authentication/Policy for details on auth policy support.  Risk: Determined attacker can prevent authentication process from staying up by keeping on attempting to log in with username containing invalid UTF-8 sequence. Steps to reproduce: Configure dovecot with auth_policy_server_url and auth_policy_hash_nonce set. Attempt to log in with username containing an invalid UTF-8 sequence Observe assert-crash in dovecot logs.  Solution: Operators should update to the latest Patch Release or disable auth policy support.
