So an unprivileged multi-threaded userspace application calling recvmsg() for the same network socket in parallel executed on ioatdma-enabled hardware with net_dma enabled can leak the memory, crash the host leading to a denial-of-service, or cause a random memory corruption.  This flaw was assigned an id of  net_dma was disabled in the upstream Linux kernel since by the "net_dma: mark broken" and then completely removed by the "net_dma: simple removal".  So this flaw affects RHEL-6 only and any (LTS) Linux kernel (of any distribution) which has not backported the net_dma disabling commits mentioned above.
