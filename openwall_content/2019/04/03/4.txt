My guess is that  such change was done as a later response to one of Jann Horn's reports  that was  fixed in commit In any case,  the vulnerable code is still present in other binary formats (if they're  still relevant), e.g., in fs/binfmt_aout.c (and others).  If my assumptions are incorrect, please let me know :)  I've also attached a PoC exploit code.  Thanks, Federico.
