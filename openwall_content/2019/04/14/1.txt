This security issue is fixed by Apache MINA or Apache MINA Please migrate to those new versions.    --  Regards, Cordialement, Emmanuel LĂŠcharny www.iktek.com  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
