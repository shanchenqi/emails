This release provides a fix for for platforms which don't have arc4random_buf() in their default libraries but do have getentropy(), such as Linux platforms with a kernel version of or newer and a glibc version of or newer.   (libXdmcp already ensured that arc4random_buf() is used on platforms that have it to provide sufficient entropy in XDMCP key generation, but left other platforms with the weaker methods.  Linux platforms could also have linked against libbsd to use arc4random_buf() with libXdmcp for stronger keys.)
