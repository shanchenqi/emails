Jann has done a search using codesearch.debian.net and it would appear that only systemd and Tor are using libseccomp in such a way as to trigger the bad code.  In the case of systemd this appears to affect the socket address family and scheduling class filters.  In the case of Tor it appears that the bad filters could impact the memory addresses passed to mprotect(2).  The libseccomp release fixes this problem, and should be a direct drop-in replacement for previous v2.x releases.  Due the complexity, and associated risk, of backporting the fix to the v2.3.x release stream, I've made the difficult decision not to backport the fix.  Further, I'm not aware of any workarounds for this issue. Adminstrators and distros are strongly encouraged to upgrade to libseccomp as soon as possible.
