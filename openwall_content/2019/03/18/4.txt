The issue is that PowerDNS Authoritative Server, when the HTTP remote backend is used in RESTful mode (without post=1 set), can be tricked by a remote user into connecting to an attacker-specified HTTP server instead of the configured one, via a crafted DNS query.  This can be used to cause a denial of service by preventing the remote backend from getting a response, content spoofing if the attacker can time its own query so that subsequent queries will use an attacker-controlled HTTP server instead of the configured one, and possibly information disclosure if the Authoritative Server has access to internal servers.  This issue has been assigned  PowerDNS Authoritative up to and including is affected. Please note that at the time of writing, PowerDNS Authoritative 3.4 and below are no longer supported, as described in [2].  The full security advisory is provided below, and can also be found at [3].  We would like to thank Adam Dobrawy, Frederico Silva and GregoryBrzeski from HyperOne.com for finding and subsequently reporting this issue!  Minimal patches are available at [4].
