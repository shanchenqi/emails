It occurs in tcp_emu() routine while emulating  Identification protocol, when crafted messages are sent to make it return  uninitialized variables.  A user/process could use this flaw to read uninitialised stack memory contents  from the QEMU process resulting in information leakage.  Upstream patch: ---------------    ->  This issue was reported by William Bowling.
