By pointing it to a malicious RMI server, an attacker could take advantage of Solr's unsafe deserialization to trigger remote code execution on the Solr side.  Mitigation: Any of the following are enough to prevent this vulnerability: * Upgrade to Apache Solr 7.0 or later. * Disable the ConfigAPI if not in use, by running Solr with the system property âdisable.configEdit=trueâ * If upgrading or disabling the Config API are not viable options, apply patch in [1] and re-compile Solr. * Ensure your network settings are configured so that only trusted traffic is allowed to ingress/egress your hosts running Solr.
