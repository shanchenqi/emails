Zip-slip vulnerability in KAR deployer  Severity: Low  Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation  Versions Affected: all versions of Apache Karaf prior to  Description:  Apache Karaf kar deployer reads .kar archives and extracts the paths from the "repository/" and "resources/" entries in the zip file.  It then writes out the content of these paths to the Karaf repo and resources directories. However, it doesn't do any validation on the paths in the zip file. This means that a malicious user could craft a .kar file with ".." directory names and break out of the directories to write arbitrary content to the filesystem. This is the "Zip-slip" vulnerability - https://snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability  This vulnerability is low if the Karaf process user has limited permission on the filesystem.  The mitigation is to prevent "Zip-slip" by checking the path used in kar zip entries and prevent use of ".." path.  This has been fixed in revision:   Mitigation: Apache Karaf users should upgrade to or later as soon as possible, or limit filesystem permission for the Karaf process user.
