Requests sent to the HBase REST server were executed with the  permissions of the REST server itself, not with the permissions of the  end-user. This issue is only relevant when HBase is configured with  Kerberos authentication, HBase authorization is enabled, and the REST  server is configured with SPNEGO authentication. This issue does not  extend beyond the HBase REST server.  Versions affected:  Mitigation: Stop the HBase REST server until your installation is  upgraded to HBase or any other later release. Upon  upgrading to a newer version, no other action is required.
