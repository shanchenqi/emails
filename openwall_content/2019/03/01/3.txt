Mitigation:  If upgrade of the broker is not possible, the support for AMQP protocols can be disabled on AMQP ports. The change can be made either directly in the broker configuration file or by using management interfaces.  An example of REST API call restricting AMQP port to support only AMQP 1.0 using curl utility is provided below:  curl --user <user-name> -X POST -d '{"protocols":["AMQP_1_0"]}' \ https://<broker host>:<broker port>/api/latest/port/<port name>  References: [1]  --------------------------------------------------------------------- To unsubscribe, e-mail: dev-unsubscribe@...d.apache.org For additional commands, e-mail: dev-help@...d.apache.org   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
