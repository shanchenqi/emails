It seems to me the server cannot change what the interactive keyboard message responses contain. They are, after all, "interactive keyboard messages", thus coming from the user sitting in front of the client system.  I can see 3 different "response_callback" functions being used to construct the responses and in one of them it is probably possible to trigger the overflow, however it would be caused by the user himself. If we assume the interactive user should not be able to execute code, I'd say the flaw does not have a remote attack vector but only local.  Did I miss anything?
