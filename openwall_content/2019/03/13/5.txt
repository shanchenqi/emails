This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier  Versions Affected:  All. Not affected:       None. Fixed Versions:      Impact ------ There is a possible file content disclosure vulnerability in Action View. Specially crafted accept headers in combination with calls to `render file:` can cause arbitrary files on the target server to be rendered, disclosing the file contents.  The impact is limited to calls to `render` which render file contents without a specified accept format.  Impacted code in a controller looks something like this:  ``` class UserController < ApplicationController   def index     render file: "#{Rails.root}/some/file"   end end ```  Rendering templates as opposed to files is not impacted by this vulnerability.  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.  Releases -------- The and releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds ----------- This vulnerability can be mitigated by specifying a format for file rendering, like this:  ``` class UserController < ApplicationController   def index     render file: "#{Rails.root}/some/file", formats: [:html]   end end ```  In summary, impacted calls to `render` look like this:  ``` render file: "#{Rails.root}/some/file" ```  The vulnerability can be mitigated by changing to this:  ``` render file: "#{Rails.root}/some/file", formats: [:html] ```  Other calls to `render` are not impacted.  Alternatively, the following monkey patch can be applied in an initializer:  ``` $ cat config/initializers/formats_filter.rb # frozen_string_literal: true  ActionDispatch::Request.prepend(Module.new do   def formats     super().select do |format|       format.symbol || format.ref == "*/*"     end   end end) ```  Patches ------- To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.  * 6-0-action-view-file-disclosure.patch - Patch for 6.0 series * 5-2-action-view-file-disclosure.patch - Patch for 5.2 series * 5-1-action-view-file-disclosure.patch - Patch for 5.1 series * 5-0-action-view-file-disclosure.patch - Patch for 5.0 series * 4-2-action-view-file-disclosure.patch - Patch for 4.2 series  Please note that only the 5.2.x, 5.1.x, 5.0.x, and 4.2.x series are supported at present. Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.  Also note that the patches for this vulnerability are the same as  Credits ------- Thanks to John Hawthorn <john@...thorn.email> of GitHub  --  Aaron Patterson http://tenderlovemaking.com/  View attachment "4-2-action-view-file-disclosure.patch" of type "text/plain" bytes)  View attachment "5-0-action-view-file-disclosure.patch" of type "text/plain" bytes)  View attachment "5-1-action-view-file-disclosure.patch" of type "text/plain" bytes)  View attachment "5-2-action-view-file-disclosure.patch" of type "text/plain" bytes)  View attachment "6-0-action-view-file-disclosure.patch" of type "text/plain" bytes)  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
