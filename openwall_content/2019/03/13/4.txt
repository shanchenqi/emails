This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier  Versions Affected:  All. Not affected:       None. Fixed Versions:      Impact ------ Specially crafted accept headers can cause the Action View template location code to consume CPU, causing the server unable to process requests.  This impacts all Rails applications that render views.  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.  Releases -------- The and releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds ----------- This vulnerability can be mitigated by wrapping `render` calls with `respond_to` blocks.  For example, the following example is vulnerable:  ``` class UserController < ApplicationController   def index     render "index"   end end ```  But the following code is not vulnerable:  ``` class UserController < ApplicationController   def index     respond_to |format|       format.html { render "index" }     end   end end ```  Implicit rendering is impacted, so this code is vulnerable:  ``` class UserController < ApplicationController   def index   end end ```  But can be changed this this:  ``` class UserController < ApplicationController   def index     respond_to |format|       format.html { render "index" }     end   end end ```  Alternatively to specifying the format, the following monkey patch can be applied in an initializer:  ``` $ cat config/initializers/formats_filter.rb # frozen_string_literal: true  ActionDispatch::Request.prepend(Module.new do   def formats     super().select do |format|       format.symbol || format.ref == "*/*"     end   end end) ```  Patches ------- To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.  * 6-0-action-view-dos.patch - Patch for 6.0 series * 5-2-action-view-dos.patch - Patch for 5.2 series * 5-1-action-view-dos.patch - Patch for 5.1 series * 5-0-action-view-dos.patch - Patch for 5.0 series * 4-2-action-view-dos.patch - Patch for 4.2 series  Please note that only the 5.2.x, 5.1.x, 5.0.x, and 4.2.x series are supported at present. Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.  Also note that the patches for this vulnerability are the same as  Credits ------- Thanks to John Hawthorn <john@...thorn.email> of GitHub  --  Aaron Patterson http://tenderlovemaking.com/  View attachment "4-2-action-view-dos.patch" of type "text/plain" bytes)  View attachment "5-0-action-view-dos.patch" of type "text/plain" bytes)  View attachment "5-1-action-view-dos.patch" of type "text/plain" bytes)  View attachment "5-2-action-view-dos.patch" of type "text/plain" bytes)  View attachment "6-0-action-view-dos.patch" of type "text/plain" bytes)  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
