This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier  Versions Affected:  5.2.X. Not affected:       None. Fixed Versions:      Impact ------ With some knowledge of a target application it is possible for an attacker to guess the automatically generated development mode secret token.  This secret token can be used in combination with other Rails internals to escalate to a remote code execution exploit.  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.  Releases -------- The and releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds ----------- This issue can be mitigated by specifying a secret key in development mode. In "config/environments/development.rb" add this:    config.secret_key_base = SecureRandom.hex(64)   Patches ------- To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.  * 6-0-railties-dev-mode-token.patch - Patch for 6.0 series * 5-2-railties-dev-mode-token.patch - Patch for 5.2 series  Please note that only the 5.2.x, 5.1.x, 5.0.x, and 4.2.x series are supported at present. Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.
