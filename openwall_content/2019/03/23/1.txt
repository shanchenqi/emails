Severity: Important  Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation  Versions Affected: Apache Mesos to The unsupported Apache Mesos releases may be also affected.  Description: A specifically crafted Docker image running under the root user can overwrite the init helper binary of the Mesos container runtime and/or the Mesos command executor. A malicious actor can therefore gain root-level code execution on the host.  Mitigation: 1.4.x users should upgrade to 1.5.x users should upgrade to 1.6.x users should upgrade to 1.7.x users should upgrade to 1.8-dev users should obtain Mesos or latest snapshot of 1.8-dev  Credit: This issue was discovered by Gilbert Song and Jie Yu based on similar RunC vulnerability report,  Alex on behalf of Mesos PMC   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
