ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Xen's reference counting rules were designed to allow pages to change owner and state without requiring a global lock.  Each page has a page structure, and a very specific set of access disciplines must be observed to ensure that pages are freed properly, and that no writable mappings exist for PV pagetable pages.  Unfortunately, when the XENMEM_exchange hypercall was introduced, these access disciplines were violated, opening up several potential race conditions.  IMPACT ======  A single PV guest can leak arbitrary amounts of memory, leading to a denial of service.  A cooperating pair of PV and HVM/PVH guests can get a writable pagetable entry, leading to information disclosure or privilege escalation.  Privilege escalation attacks using only a single PV guest or a pair of PV guests have not been ruled out.  Note that both of these attacks require very precise timing, which may be difficult to exploit in practice.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Only x86 systems are vulnerable.  Only systems which run PV guests are vulnerable.  Systems which run only HVM/PVH guests are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only HVM or PVH guests will avoid these vulnerabilities.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            xen-unstable      Xen      Xen       Xen 4.9.x       Xen 4.8.x       Xen 4.7.x  $        $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
