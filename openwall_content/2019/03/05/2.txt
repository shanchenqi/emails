ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  When adding a passed-through PCI device to a domain after it was already started, IOMMU page tables may need constructing on the fly.  For PV guests the decision whether a page ought to have a mapping is based on whether the page is writable, to prevent IOMMU access to things like page tables.  Writablility of a page may, however, change at any time. Failure of the relevant code to respect this possible race may lead to IOMMU mappings of, in particular, page tables, allowing the guest to alter such page tables without Xen auditing the changes.  IMPACT ======  Malicious PV guests can escalate their privilege to that of the hypervisor.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All versions of Xen are vulnerable.  Only x86 systems are vulnerable.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.  Only x86 PV guests can exploit the vulnerability.  x86 HVM and PVH guests cannot exploit the vulnerability.  Only guests which are assigned a device after domain creation can exploit this vulnerability.  Guests which are not assigned devices, or guests assigned devices at domain creation time, cannot exploit this vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only HVM or PVH guests avoids the vulnerability.  Assigning passed-through PCI devices to PV guests at domain creation time also avoids the vulnerability.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            xen-unstable      Xen 4.7.x - Xen  $    $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
