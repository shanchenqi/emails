ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  When an x86 PV domain has a passed-through PCI device assigned, IOMMU mappings may need to be updated when the type of a particular page changes.  Such an IOMMU operation may fail.  In the event of failure, while at present the affected guest would be forcibly crashed, the already recorded additional type reference was not dropped again.  This causes a bug check to trigger while cleaning up after the crashed guest.  IMPACT ======  Malicious or buggy x86 PV guest kernels can mount a Denial of Service (DoS) attack affecting the whole system.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen versions from 4.8 onwards are vulnerable.  Only x86 systems are vulnerable.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.  Only x86 PV guests can exploit the vulnerability.  x86 HVM and PVH guests cannot exploit the vulnerability.  Only guests which are assigned a physical device can exploit this vulnerability.  Guests which are not assigned physical devices cannot exploit this vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only HVM or PVH guests avoids the vulnerability.  Not passing through PCI devices to PV guests also avoids the vulnerability.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Igor Druzhinin and Andrew Cooper of Citrix.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            xen-unstable      Xen Xen       Xen 4.9.x, Xen 4.8.x  $     $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
