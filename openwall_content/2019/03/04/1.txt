Severity: Moderate  Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation  Versions Affected: Apache Mesos to The unsupported Apache Mesos releases may be also affected.  Description: When parsing a JSON payload with deeply nested JSON structures, the parser might overflow the stack due to unbounded recursion. A malicious actor can therefore cause a denial of service of Mesos masters rendering the Mesos-controlled cluster inoperable.  Mitigation: pre-1.4.x users should upgrade to at least 1.4.x users should upgrade to 1.5.x users should upgrade to 1.6.x users should upgrade to users should upgrade to 1.8-dev users should obtain Mesos or later  Credit: This issue was discovered by Terry Chia (Ayrx).
