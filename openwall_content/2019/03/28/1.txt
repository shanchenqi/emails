Feel free to join our bug bounty programs (open-xchange, dovecot, powerdns) at HackerOne. Please find patches for and attached, or download new version.  Yours sincerely, Aki Tuomi Open-Xchange Oy  Product: Dovecot  Vendor: OX Software GmbH Â  Internal reference: (Bug ID) Vulnerability type: Vulnerable version: - Vulnerable component: fts, pop3-uidl-plugin Report confidence: Confirmed Researcher credits: Found in internal testing Solution status: Fixed by Vendor Fixed version: Vendor notification: Solution date: Public disclosure: CVE reference: CVSS: 3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C (8.8) Â  Vulnerability Details: When reading FTS or POP3-UIDL header from dovecot index, the input buffer size is not bound, and data is copied to target structure causing stack overflow.  Risk: This can be used for local root privilege escalation or executing arbitrary code in dovecot process context. This requires ability to directly modify dovecot indexes. Steps to reproduce: Produce dovecot.index.log entry that creates an FTS header which has more than 12 bytes of data. Trigger dovecot indexer-worker or run doveadm index. Dovecot will crash.  Mitigations: Since dovecot has been compiled with stack smash protection, ASLR, read-only GOT tables and other techniques that make exploiting this bug much harder.  Solution: Operators should update to the latest Patch Release. The only workaround is to disable FTS and pop3-uidl plugin.
