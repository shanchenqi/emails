A specially crafted PostScript file could use this flaw in order to, for example, have access to the file system outside of the constrains imposed by -dSAFER.  This one is considered particularly Important because it can be easily triggered inside popular Linux PostScript viewers, or embedded in a PDF when read by the `gs` command, and could be used to modify the content of bashrc.  Upstream fixes:  * Fix bug Restrict superexec and remove it from internals and gs_cet.ps  * Bug Obliterate "superexec". We don't need it, nor do any known apps.  Upstream bug report (currently restricted) :  Note: The only important fix is the second one, the other one is only a dependency.  To test if you are affected (on recent ghostscript, starting from [starting from commit  $ gs -dSAFER -dNODISPLAY GS> internaldict /superexec known { (VULNERABLE\n) } { (SAFE\n) } ifelse print  On versions older than this would be sufficient :  GS> /superexec where { (VULNERABLE\n) } { (SAFE\n) } ifelse print    2- ghostscript: forceput in DefineResource is still accessible  It was found that the forceput operator could be extracted from the DefineResource method using methods similar to the ones described in A specially crafted PostScript file could use this flaw in order to, for example, have access to the file system outside of the constrains imposed by -dSAFER.  Upstream bug report (currently restricted) :  Upstream fixes: * *  Don't hesitate to let me know if further information is required  Best regards,  -- Cedric Buissart Red Hat Product Security  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
