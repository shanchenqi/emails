I'm aware that whether open redirects are vulnerabilities is debatable (which is also reflected in the discussion with tt-rss, but they fixed it nevertheless).  PoC:  Report to tt-rss developers: Fix:  This was reported by Mariia Aleksandrova (zophi), I just forwarded the report to the tt-rss developers.  --  Hanno Bรถck https://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
