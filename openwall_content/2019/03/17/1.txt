Plugin URL https://wordpress.org/plugins/hrm/. Affected and possibly below. Fixed in according to developer who didn't respond to me, but communicated with WordPress.   When creating new leave as admin user there is user picker visible in the UI. Using same queries as picker functionality any logged in user (e.g. Subscriber) can use search_emp_leave_records action to print all WordPress users credentials from database.  {"success":true,"data":[{"ID":"1","user_login":"henri","user_pass":"$P$Bho3..   Any user can create new leave and can change status of leave (approving, canceling etc).  Recommendation for developers:  Authorize users using a whitelist of roles allowed to call specific actions. Define roles for all actions with secure default e.g. admin only. Ensure that password hashes are not printed to any user. Function https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_users could be used to list the users.
