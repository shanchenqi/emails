A few notes about this exploit:  - It supports several targets by default (vulnerable versions of Debian,   Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS), and it should be relatively easy to add more   targets.  - When adding a new amd64 target, use the "free_hook" method if possible   (if located at a multiple of 16 plus 8, as explained in our advisory);   for various reasons, the alternative "stderr_chain" method is not as   reliable as "free_hook" and may therefore take longer to succeed.  - When adding and testing a new target, you may want to set   "StartLimitInterval=1s" and "StartLimitBurst=10" (for example) in   "systemd-journald.service": the exploit will detect this and   brute-force faster.  - If the exploit dies because "No journal files were opened due to   insufficient permissions", the "wall" method can be used instead (via   the "-w" switch). Our exploit currently implements the wall method   "ssh but alternative methods can be implemented   ("utempter" and "gnome-pty-helper", for example).  - To test the default information-leak method even if "No journal files   were opened due to insufficient permissions", it is enough to create   /var/log/journal/ (as explained in "man systemd-journald").  Thank you very much!
