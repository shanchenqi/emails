The flaws only exist on 32 bit architectures and require excessive string input lengths.  We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.  INFO ----  There are two entry points to this issue, on 32 bit architectures.  By asking libcurl to parse a string, passing in a string longer than 2GB to this API: `curl_url_set(uh, CURLUPART_URL, "string", 0);` triggers the bug.  Asking libcurl to update a URL with a new string, and URL encoded it in the process, by passing in a string longer than to this API: `curl_url_set(uh, CURLUPART_*, "string", CURLU_URLENCODE);` triggers the bug.  This bug was introduced in August in [commit  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name to this issue.  Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size  Severity: 3.7 (Low)  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  - Affected versions: libcurl to and including - Not affected versions: libcurl < and >= libcurl  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such.  THE SOLUTION ------------  A [fix for is already merged.  RECOMMENDATIONS --------------  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:    A - Upgrade curl to version    B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild  TIMELINE --------  The issue was reported to the curl project on April 24, The patch was communicated to the reporter on April 25, We contacted distros@...nwall on May 15.  curl was released on May 22 coordinated with the publication of this advisory.
