It calls `recvfrom()` with the default size for the buffer rather than with the size that was used to allocate it. Thus, the content that might overwrite the heap memory is entirely controlled by the server.  The flaw exists if the user selects to use a "blksize" of or smaller (default is The smaller size that is used, the larger the possible overflow becomes.  Users chosing a smaller size than default should be rare as the primary use case for changing the size is to make it larger.  It is rare for users to use TFTP across the Internet. It is most commonly used within local networks.  We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.  INFO ----  This bug was introduced in January in  [commit  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name to this issue.  Heap-based Buffer Overflow  Severity: 1.8 (Low)  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  - Affected versions: libcurl to and including - Not affected versions: libcurl < and >= libcurl  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such.  THE SOLUTION ------------  A [fix for  RECOMMENDATIONS --------------  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:    A - Upgrade curl to version    B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild    C - do not use TFTP with curl  TIMELINE --------  The issue was reported to the curl project on April 29, The patch was communicated to the reporter on April 29, We contacted distros@...nwall on May 15.  curl was released on May 22 coordinated with the publication of this advisory.
