The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * Credentials * PAM Authentication  Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  / A missing permission check in PAM Authentication Plugin allowed users with  Overall/Read permission to invoke a form validation method to obtain  limited information about the file /etc/shadow on systems with that file  present, as well as the system user the Jenkins process is running as.   / Credentials Plugin allowed the creation of Certificate credentials from a  PKCS#12 file on the Jenkins master. Users with permission to create or  update credentials could use the associated form validation to confirm the  existence of files with an attacker-specified path.  Additionally, they could create credentials from any valid PKCS#12 file on  the Jenkins master. With the ability to configure jobs to access these  credentials, they could obtain the certificate content.
