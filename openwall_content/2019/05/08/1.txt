Google "store fingerprint data ios android",    there are suitable solutions.  Mostly: Your fingerprint is not a secret like a password, it is a username.  Since you can't change the fingerprint (biometrics problem), it is not  very useful as a single authentication factor. Either you live with  this, or you combine the fingerprint with a different authentication  factor type.  Roman.
