The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * Gitea Plugin * InfluxDB Plugin * Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin * Pipeline Remote Loader Plugin 1.5 * Warnings Next Generation Plugin  Additionally, we announce unresolved security issues in the following plugins:  * Artifactory Plugin  Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---   / Warnings Next Generation Plugin rendered the name of a custom warnings  parser unescaped on Jenkins web pages. This allowed attackers with  Job/Configure permission to define a custom parser whose name included  HTML and JavaScript, resulting in a persisted cross-site scripting  vulnerability.  Warnings Next Generation Plugin now properly escapes custom warnings  parser names.   / Warnings Next Generation Plugin did not require that requests sent to the  endpoint used to reset warning counts use POST. This resulted in a cross- site request forgery vulnerability that allows attackers to reset warning  counts for future builds.  Warnings Next Generation Plugin now requires that these requests be sent  via POST.   / Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin did not configure its XML parser in a  way that would prevent XML External Entity (XXE) processing.  This allowed attackers able to control the contents of a temporary  directory on the agent that the Maven build is executing on to have  Jenkins parse a maliciously crafted XML file that uses external entities  for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins master, server-side request  forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.  Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin no longer processes XML External  Entities in XML documents.   / Pipeline Remote Loader Plugin provides a custom Script Security whitelist.  Those entries apply to all scripts with sandbox protection, such as  Pipeline.  One entry provided here was unsafe, as it allowed invoking arbitrary  methods, bypassing sandbox protection.  The unsafe whitelist entry has been removed.   / InfluxDB Plugin stored target passwords unencrypted in its global  configuration file on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be  viewed by users with access to the master file system.  InfluxDB Plugin now stores its passwords encrypted.   / Multibranch pipelines are typically configured so that only committers to  the repository are able to effectively propose changes to Jenkinsfiles.  Changes to Jenkinsfiles in pull requests created by other users would not  be trusted, and the target branchâs Jenkinsfile content is used instead.  Gitea Plugin did not implement this behavior. Attackers without commit  access to the Git repository could therefore propose changes to  Jenkinsfiles and have those be applied for PR builds despite the  configuration declaring them to be untrusted.  Gitea Plugin now implements the desired behavior of only trusting pull  request content when those are trusted.   (1) / (CSRF), (permission check) Artifactory Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method  implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access  to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker- specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing  credentials stored in Jenkins.  Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests,  resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.  As of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is  available.   (2) / Artifactory Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow  users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.  This functionality does not correctly check permissions, allowing any user  with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those  can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another  vulnerability.  As of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is  available.   / Artifactory Plugin implements a number of API endpoints allowing users to  trigger various actions related to releasing and promotion.  These endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site  request forgery vulnerability.  As of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is  available.
