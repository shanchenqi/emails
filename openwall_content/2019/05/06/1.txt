Arbitrary file write vulnerability in Config service  Severity: Low  Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation  Versions Affected: all versions of Apache Karaf prior to  Description:  Apache Karaf Config service provides a install method (via service or MBean) that could be used to travel in any directory and overwrite existing file.  The vulnerability is low if the Karaf process user has limited permission on the filesystem.  The mitigation is to prevent travel "outside" of Karaf etc folder by checking the path argument of the method and prevent use of ".." in the path.  This has been fixed in revision:   Mitigation: Apache Karaf users should upgrade to or later as soon as possible, or limit filesystem permission for the Karaf process user.
