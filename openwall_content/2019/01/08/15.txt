ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The INVPCID instruction raises #GP[0] if an attempt is made to invalidate a non-canonical address.  Older flushing mechanisms such as INVLPG tolerate this without error, and perform no action.  There is one guest accessible path in Xen where a non-canonical address was passed into the TLB flushing code.  This previously had no ill effect, but became vulnerable with the introduction of PCID to reduce the performance hit from the Meltdown mitigations.  IMPACT ======  A buggy or malicious PV guest can crash the host.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Only hardware which supports the INVPCID instruction is vulnerable.  This is available on Intel Haswell processors and later.  AMD x86 processors are not known to support this instruction, and ARM processors are entirely unaffected.  Only versions of Xen with PCID support are vulnerable.  Support first appeared in Xen but was backported to the stable trees as part of the Meltdown / fixes.  Xen as well as the stable-4.7 and 4.6 branches are vulnerable.  The vulnerability is only exposed to 64-bit PV guests.  32-bit PV guests, as well as HVM/PVH guests cannot exploit the vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  Booting Xen with `pcid=0` or `invpcid=0` on the command line will work around the issue.  Alternatively, running untrusted 64bit PV guests inside xen-shim will work around the issue.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Matthew Daley.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.              xen-unstable, Xen Xen         Xen 4.9.x ... 4.7.x  $    $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.   (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
