For networking issues, just send them to the netdev@...r.kernel.org mailing list as the developers there want to find out these types of things.  And no need to post all syzbot issues to security@, that doesn't make sense, just send them to the correct mailing lists and developers so they can work to resolve them.  Like the other people who use this tool do.  thanks,  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
