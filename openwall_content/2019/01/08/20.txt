If you are still on or earlier we strongly encourage you to  upgrade to the latest version, but at least to to get fixes for  these CVEs.  An authenticated user can execute code remotely on the  Airflow webserver by creating a special object.  CSRF Vulnerabilities - One of which allowed for a remote  command injection on a default install of Airflow  An experimental Airflow feature displayed authenticated  cookies, as well as passwords to databases used by Airflow.Â  An attacker  who has limited access to airflow, weather it be via XSS or by leaving a  machine unlocked. An attacker can exfil all credentials from the system.  These are quite old so I am have not managed to attribute these to any  specific reporter. If you reported one of these: sorry, and let me know  (off list) and I will correct this.  Thanks, Ash  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.  Confused about mailing lists and their use?
