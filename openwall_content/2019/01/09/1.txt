It's a local DOS, so that's a security concern for some people.  But AFAICT the lockup warning only happens because the injected SLAB failure tries to call printk(). If there'd been a real allocation failure it would have just returned an error and there'd be no issue.  If you modify the reproducer to also do:  	write_file("/sys/kernel/debug/failslab/verbose", "0");  Then it shouldn't do the printk() and hopefully there'll be no lockup warning.  cheers  > On Tue, Jan 8, at AM Entropy Moe wrote: >> >> Hello, >> I wanted to let you know that there seem to be a deadlock vulnerability on the linux kernel >> I am attaching the result report from syzkaller which also got the c code for replication. >> >> thank you, >>  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
