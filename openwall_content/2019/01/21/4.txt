I reported results in the FreeBSD kernel to their security team. Over the next 2 years some of the bugs were fixed but it seems like only when they were re-reported.  I re-ran the analyzer against an updated FreeBSD kernel and reported updated results [5] last month--the crossed out reports are false positives as determined by manual inspection. Though the impact of these bugs is not critical, they are worth fixing. I've contacted the security team again but it did not sound like these reports were prioritized to be fixed immediately. I'm e-mailing oss-security to let other downstream FreeBSD users patch them on their own if they were so inclined. Most of them can be fixed by simply adding a memset() or an M_ZERO to malloc().
