Description:  Roller relies on Java SAX Parser to implement its XML-RPC interface and by default that parser supports external entities in XML DOCTYPE, which opens Roller up to SSRF / File Enumeration vulnerability. Note that this vulnerability exists even if Roller XML-RPC interface is disable via the Roller web admin UI.  Mitigation:     There are a couple of ways you can fix this vulnerability:     1) Upgrade to the latest version of Roller, which is now     2) Or, edit the Roller web.xml file and comment out the XML-RPC Servlet mapping as shown below:  <!-- <servlet-mapping>     <servlet-name>XmlRpcServlet</servlet-name>     <url-pattern>/roller-services/xmlrpc</url-pattern> </servlet-mapping> -->  Credit:     This issue was discovered by Arseniy Sharoglazov.
