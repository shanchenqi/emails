I don't see memslot.c using g_critical() neither on the branch (which doesn't have or master?  https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/spice/spice/blob/master/server/memslot.c#L97  --  Bye, Peter Korsgaard  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
