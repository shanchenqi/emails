XXE vulnerability found on Apache Karaf  Severity: Moderate  Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation  Versions Affected: all versions of Apache Karaf prior to  Description:  Apache Karaf provides a features deployer, which allows users to "hot deploy" a features XML by dropping the file directly in the deploy folder.  The features XML is parsed by XMLInputFactory class.  Apache Karaf XMLInputFactory class doesn't contain any mitigation codes against XXE. This is a potential security risk as an user can inject external XML entities.  The mitigation is to prevent XXE by disabling external entities loading feature in XMLInputFactory and XmlUtils.  This has been fixed in revision:   Mitigation: Apache Karaf users should upgrade to or later as soon as possible.  JIRA Tickets:  Credit: This issue was reported by Brian Wang.
