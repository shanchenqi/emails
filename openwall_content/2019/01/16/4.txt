The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * Jenkins weekly * Jenkins LTS  Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  Users with the Overall/RunScripts permission (typically administrators)  were able to use the Jenkins script console to craft a 'Remember me'  cookie that would never expire.  This allowed attackers access to a Jenkins instance while the  corresponding user in the configured security realm exists, for example to  persist access after another successful attack.    When using an external security realm such as LDAP or Active Directory,  deleting a user from the security realm does not result in the user losing  access to Jenkins.  While deleting the user record from Jenkins did invalidate the 'Remember  me' cookie, there was no way to invalidate active sessions besides  restarting Jenkins or terminating sessions through other means, such as  Monitoring Plugin.
