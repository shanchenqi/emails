Crashing in a controlled fashion may also be *more* secure that continuing execution with undefined results. Depending on circumstances, of course.  I read the general statement "asserts considered harmful" as your personal opionion, likely based on experience with very different development projects than I'm involved with. And gmp-bugs isn't really the right place for that debate (and neither is the nettle mailinglist).  > Second, the SIGABRT terminates the process and can write a core file.  A security sensitive application can easily disable generation of core files, using setrlimit (on the linux kernel, prctl may also be useful). That's all part of crashing in a *controlled* fashion on assertion failures. As far as I'm aware, disabling core dumps is a fairly common practice in security sensitive applications.  (And besides, most systems have zero ulimit -c as the system default these days. Which makes sense to me (any application might handle data that is sensitive to the user), even though as a developer, it's annoying with extra hoops required to get proper core dumps, including disabling the core dump collection "services" you mention).  And as Vincent says, there are many ways to crash due to bugs, without triggering any assertion failure. And you should avoid generating core dumps for those crashes too.
