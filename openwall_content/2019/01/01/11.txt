I believe the assumption  is incorrect. The sources were not modified, and a standard (?) 'configure; make; make check' was used. The reproducer script is available at see test-gmp.sh.txt.  For completeness here's a quick audit of some security libraries. Botan, Crypto++ and OpenSSL use -DNDEBUG to remove asserts from production/release builds. They use asserts as a debugging/diagnostic aide. They don't depend on crashing the program and risk egressing sensitive information outside the app's security boundary.  grep -iIR assert | wc -l  grep -iIR assert | wc -l  grep -iIR assert | wc -l  grep -iIR assert | wc -l  cryptopp-8.0$ grep -iIR assert | wc -l  botan-2.8$ grep -iIR assert | wc -l  Cheers, Jeff  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
