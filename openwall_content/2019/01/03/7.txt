You have the build script. It is called test-gmp.sh. There's nothing special about it. It's a straight configure; make; make install. It bears witness to the errors GMP's configuration produces.  I'm not sure how that is spreading lies.  When I said, "ARM A-32 does not work at the moment due to GMP build errors", it was a statement of fact to explain why ARM A-32 was not tested. It may speak to a broken configuration script, but a broken configure script does not leak sensitive information. It is really not worth discussing here.  >   Returning a failure from mpn_sec_powm would be a most welcomed >   improvement. > > You have repeated this several times already.  Actually, that was the first time I suggested it.  > The GMP API is what it is.  If you don't like it, well, we're so sorry.  Yes, it certainly is. It is the cause of the troubles for some software.  Some software probably does not care and can get along fine with crashing. For example, I don't really care much if Notepad or Paint crashes because it is not handling sensitive information.  Vincent and Halfdog talked about complimentary security controls to remediate the information leak. However, their discussions apply to some enterprises and take a considerable amount of knowledge beyond "disable coredumps".  What their discussion has not touched upon is:  1. not all enterprises have knowledgeable engineers 2. not all applications are enterprise 3. not all security controls are available  Item (1) is self explanatory. Sometimes there are A players, and sometimes there are B and C team players.  For item (2), there are other non-enterprise users, like folks using Android, iOS and Windows devices. iOS devices don't allow you to control crash dumps. They are written and retrievable. About all you can do is decline sending them. I also believe they are sync'd so a dump gets transferred to a Mac or MacBook. Yet more egress...  For item (3), there are often missing complimentary security controls. For example, a TPM is available on low-end netbooks. A Windows machine could encrypt the filesystem so the crash dump is also encrypted. However, a user running Windows 10 Home does not have Bitlocker available. It is an upsell item.  >    <other nonsense removed>  > We've had enough of your nagging and aggressiveness and your threats in > private email.

And as a courtesy I emailed you offlist letting you know I was going to discuss this in other forums.  Claiming a discussion of insecure use of assert is aggressive or nagging is a bit tenuous. So is claiming a courtesy email is threatening. But I understand GMP is your baby and criticism is probably not welcomed. My apologies for that.
