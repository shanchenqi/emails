It was found that `.forceput` operator was present and unprotected in the `.charkeys` method and could be retrieved via manipulation of the error handler.  The `.charkeys` method was vulnerable since in one way or another: the privileged operator was `superexec` instead of `.forceput` until a more recent version.  Upstream fix:  Upstream bug report (currently private):  Red Hat would like to thank upstream, Artifex, for alerting us about the flaw. The vulnerability was originally reported by Paul Manfred & Lukas Schauer.  Note: similarly to other recent ghostscript vulnerabilities, this one is mitigated by the recent -dSAFER rework. However, and older are fully impacted.  -- Cedric Buissart Red Hat Product Security  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
