I used the syzkaller fuzzer with custom modifications and found a bunch of 5-year old bugs in the Linux kernel. I managed to exploit one of them for a local privilege escalation.  These vulnerabilities are caused by wrong mutex locking in the vivid driver of the V4L2 subsystem. Please see the fixing patch that I've just sent to LKML:  The vivid driver doesn't require any special hardware. It is shipped in Ubuntu, Debian, Arch Linux, SUSE Linux Enterprise and openSUSE.  On Ubuntu the devices created by this driver are available to the normal user, since Ubuntu applies RW ACL when the user is logged in:   getfacl /dev/video0   getfacl: Removing leading '/' from absolute path names   # file: dev/video0   # owner: root   # group: video   user::rw-   user:a13x:rw-   group::rw-   mask::rw-   other::---  (Un)fortunately, I don't know how to autoload the vulnerable driver, which limits the severity of these vulnerabilities. That's why the Linux kernel security team allows me to do the full disclosure.  But there is an interesting aspect -- my PoC exploit bypasses SMEP and SMAP on the fresh Ubuntu Server Moreover, it gains the local privilege escalation from the kthread context (where the userspace is not mapped). I'm going to share the details about the exploit techniques later.  For now I would recommend to blacklist the vivid kernel module on your machines.
