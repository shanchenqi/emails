I'm very reluctant to give this advice, not because it's wrong, but because the failure mode is misaligned for most people.  The average user of a distribution (personal or professional) is at much greater risk of a compromise due to an unpatched security vulnerability than due to malicious code introduced in the distribution package update stream.  Both are *possible*, but one of them is far more common (I would even say by orders of magnitude).  Determining which updates are security updates is tedious and requires a lot of discipline; it's something that humans are generally bad at, and the failure mode is usually to not apply the update.  Many security updates are not explicitly flagged as such (see all the recent discussions on this list about CVEs).  The average user is therefore best served by applying all distribution updates.  Choosing not to update to reduce your risk of a supply chain attack is a very advanced technique, and I would tell people to think very hard about whether they want to sign up for the necessary cognitive load and disciplined decision-making required to identify relevant security updates that they need to apply.  --  Russ Allbery (eagle@...ie.org)             <https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/>  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
