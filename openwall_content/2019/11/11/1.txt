While I did not have anything to do with the discovery of the issue [1][2], I'd like to raise attention due to the high possible impact.  Steps to reproduce: - Create a JPEG image, size x RGB with 8 bits per channel. - Run gdb tjbench  >(gdb) run reproducer.jpeg > > Image size: x >  > Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault. > in __memset_avx2_erms () from > (gdb) bt > #0  in __memset_avx2_erms () from > #1  in memset __dest=<optimized out>) at /usr/include/bits/string_fortified.h:71 > #2  decomp (srcBuf=0x0, dstBuf=<optimized out>, subsamp=2, jpegQual=0,  >     fileName=0x7fffffffdfaa at > #3  in decompTest (fileName=0x7fffffffdfaa at > #4  main (argc=<optimized out>, argv=<optimized out>) at  We identified that it crashed on writing to a libc.so mapping.  The reproducer is also described in our bug report [3].
