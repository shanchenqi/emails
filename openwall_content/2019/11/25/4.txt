IA-32 (uname -m: i?86) Linux kernels are buggy/vulnerable when running    IA-32 (i?86-linux-*) user-space processes (which are the only user-space    that these kernels support)  B. (aka AMD64, uname -m: Linux kernels are buggy/vulnerable    when running IA-32 (i?86-linux-*) user-space processes, but not when    running user-space processes  C. (AMD64) Linux kernels are buggy/vulnerable when running x32    processes  D. something else?  If I'm understanding correctly, you are reporting A, and only A?
