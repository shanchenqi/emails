Perhaps unsurprisingly, it was badly broken.  I’m not even going to try to enumerate individual bugs here. I’m guessing that at least all kernels that support PTI are vulnerable to privilege escalation via a series of ESPFIX bugs, but the missing segment override issue could go back years.  Getting a nice printout on a double fault instead of a reboot, hang or memory corruption is dubious with PTI, and it’s also busted if you have this newfangled thing called “SMP” enabled.  The relevant tests to run are (from an updated kernel) and the same test with perf record -e cycles -F  The bugs are hopefully mostly fixed in a pull request here:   I strongly suspect that there is at least one bug left.  You can mitigate these issues by upgrading to an kernel. You can probably get a decent degree of mitigation by setting CONFIG_VM86=n and  should be fine on a 64-bit kernel. Long live Wine.)  To those of you who actually support please either consider stopping supporting it or finding and paying someone to give it serious upstream attention.  We need real CI resources and we need developers to test things for real, fix what’s broken, and generally keep it up to date. And the developers in question should have an appropriate degree of nostalgic adoration of segments, gates, and other delights from the era.
