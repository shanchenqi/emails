Indeed. Reproducible builds does not solve the case described by Ken Thompson in Trusting Trust [1], nor enables the work described by David Wheeler and DDC [2]. But that isn't explicitly the goal either. We first need to be in a state where we are capable of reproducing the distributed artifacts. Then we can investigate the boostrap problem.  Which is why Reproducible Builds is also invested in this problem :) There is a yearly summit with projects that contribute to reproducible builds. Last year in Paris there where 3 sessions on bootstrapping The sessions where mostly lead by Guix developers if I recall correctly, and they have been doing great progress on this problem [6].
