This issue can only be triggered if unbound was compiled with `--enable-ipsecmod` support, and ipsecmod is enabled and used in the configuration.  == Affected products Unbound up to and including  == Description Due to unsanitized characters passed to the ipsecmod-hook shell command, it is possible for Unbound to allow shell code execution from a specially crafted IPSECKEY answer.  This issue can only be triggered when *all* of the below conditions are met: * unbound was compiled with `--enable-ipsecmod` support, and * ipsecmod is enabled and used in the configuration (either in the   configuration file or using `unbound-control`), and * a domain is part of the ipsecmod-whitelist (if ipsecmod-whitelist is   used), and * unbound receives an A/AAAA query for a domain that has an A/AAAA   record(s) *and* an IPSECKEY record(s) available.  The shell code execution can then happen if either the qname or the gateway field of the IPSECKEY (when gateway type == 3) contain a specially crafted domain name.  == Solution Download patched version of Unbound, or apply the patch manually.  + Downloading patched version Unbound is released with the patch  + Applying the Patch manually For Unbound up to and including the patch is:  Apply the patch on the Unbound source directory with: 'patch -p1 < then run 'make install' to install Unbound.  == Acknowledgments We would like to thank X41 D-Sec for notifying us about this vulnerability and OSTIF for sponsoring the Unbound security audit.
