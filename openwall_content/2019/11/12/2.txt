Some downstream stakeholders were warned in advance in order to coordinate the release of fixes and reduce the vulnerability window.  Problem: A malicious container which has direct access to the vhost-user socket can keep sending messages which may cause leaking resources until resulting a DOS.  All users of the vhost library are strongly encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible.
