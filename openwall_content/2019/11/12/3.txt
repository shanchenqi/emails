The x86 architecture explicitly permits modification of the pagetables without TLB invalidation, but in this corner case, the impacted core ceases operating and an unexpected machine check or system reset occurs.  This corner case can be triggered by guest kernels.  For more details, see:   https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/insights/deep-dive-machine-check-error-avoidance-page-size-change  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest kernel can crash the host, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).  (This CPU bug may also be triggered accidentally.)  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Systems running all versions of Xen are affected.  Only x86 processors are vulnerable.  ARM processors are not believed to be vulnerable.  Only Intel Core based processors (from Nehalem onwards) are affected. Other processors designs (Intel Atom/Knights range), and other manufacturers (AMD) are not known to be affected.  Only x86 HVM/PVH guests can exploit the vulnerability.  x86 PV guests cannot exploit the vulnerability.  Please consult the Intel Security Advisory for details on the affected processors.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only PV guests avoids the vulnerability.  Booting Xen with `hap_2mb=0 hap_1gb=0` on the command line, to disable the use of HAP superpages, works around the vulnerability.  Booting Xen with `hap=0` to disable HAP entirely, or configuring HVM/PVH guests to use shadow paging (hap=0 in xl.cfg) works around the vulnerability, but the performance impact of shadow paging in combination with in-guest Meltdown mitigations (KPTI, KVAS, etc) will most likely make this option prohibitive to use.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patches resolves this issue.  By default, Xen will disable executable superpages on believed-vulnerable hardware, and report so at boot:    (XEN) VMX: Disabling executable EPT superpages due to  See the performance and safety consideration section below.            xen-unstable      Xen      Xen      Xen       Xen 4.9.x       Xen 4.8.x  The patches are comprised of:  *-1.patch: Fix on SandyBridge hardware discovered during testing  *-2.patch: Main security fix  *-3.patch: and later) Runtime control of fast vs secure  $                 $  PERFORMANCE AND SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS =====================================  Disabling executable EPT superpages does come with a performance impact, caused by increased iTLB pressure.  The overhead will be workload and CPU dependant.  In configurations where guest kernels are trusted not to mount a DoS attempt, the mitigation can be turned off by booting with `ept=exec-sp`.  In configurations where the guest kernels are not trusted, users are recommended to measure the impact to their workloads as part of deciding between fast and secure.  On Xen and later, a runtime decision can be made between fast and secure by using `xl set-parameters ept=[no-]exec-sp`.  NOTE REGARDING LACK OF EMBARGO ==============================  Despite an attempt to organise predisclosure, the discoverers ultimately did not authorise a predisclosure. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----  =LdOL -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
