The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * Anchore Container Image Scanner Plugin * Google Compute Engine Plugin * JIRA Plugin * QMetry for JIRA - Test Management Plugin * Script Security Plugin * Spira Importer Plugin * Support Core Plugin  Additionally, we announce unresolved security issues in the following plugins:  * QMetry for JIRA - Test Management Plugin  Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  / Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin could be circumvented through  closure default parameter expressions.  This allowed attackers able to specify and run sandboxed scripts to  execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins master JVM.   / (permission check), (path traversal) Support Core Plugin did not validate the paths submitted for the "Delete  Support Bundles" feature. This allowed users to delete arbitrary files on  the Jenkins master file system accessible to the OS user account running  Jenkins.  Additionally, this endpoint did not perform a permission check, allowing  users with Overall/Read permission to delete support bundles, and any  arbitrary other file, with a known name/path.   / JIRA Plugin allows the definition of per-folder Jira sites.  The credentials lookup for this feature did not set the appropriate  context, allowing the use of System-scoped credentials otherwise reserved  for use in the global configuration. This allowed users with Item/Configure permission on the folder to access credentials theyâre not entitled to,  and potentially capture them.   / Anchore Container Image Scanner Plugin stored an Anchore.io service  password unencrypted in job config.xml files as part of its configuration.  This credential could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or  access to the master file system.   / Spira Importer Plugin stored a credential unencrypted in its global  configuration file com.inflectra.spiratest.plugins.SpiraBuilder.xml on the  Jenkins master. This credential could be viewed by users with access to  the master file system.   / Google Compute Engine Plugin did not use SSH host key verification when  connecting to VMs launched by the plugin. This lack of verification could  be abused by a MitM attacker to intercept these connections to  attacker-specified build agents without warning.   / Google Compute Engine Plugin did not verify permissions on multiple  auto-complete API endpoints. This allowed users with Overall/Read  permissions to view various metadata about the running cloud environment.   / Google Compute Engine Plugin did not require POST requests on an API  endpoint. This CSRF vulnerability allowed attackers to provision new  agents.   (1) / QMetry for JIRA - Test Management Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in  job config.xml files on the Jenkins master as part of its post-build step  configuration. This credential could be viewed by users with Extended Read  permission or access to the master file system.   (2) / QMetry for JIRA - Test Management Plugin stores a credential as part of  its post-build step configuration.  While the password is stored encrypted on disk since QMetry for JIRA -  Test Management Plugin it is transmitted in plain text as part of  the configuration form. This can result in exposure of the password  through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and  similar situations.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
