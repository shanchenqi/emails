Signed integer arithmetic is commonly used even without integer overflows.  Could this compiler issue be security problem?  Any workarounds?  ===poc=== #include <assert.h>  int foo(int a) {   > a);   printf("%d   return a; }  int main() {     foo(0x7fffffff); } =========   CV:    https://j.ludost.net/resumegg.pdf site:  http://www.guninski.com blog:  https://j.ludost.net/blog  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
