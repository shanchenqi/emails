In both cases there is a potential vulnerability where data in memory can be unintentionally shared if Arrow Arrays are transmitted over the wire (for instance with Flight) or persisted in the streaming IPC and file formats.  Neither bug affects data persisted to the Apache Parquet file format.   The first issue affected ArrayBuilder classes in and releases.  In some cases arrays with null values could be built using uninitialized memory for their data segment.   The second bug affected Apache Arrow versions since at least  The bug left data read from Apache Parquet files with RLE null encoded data uninitialized.   It is recommended that users upgrade to as soon as possible and audit any data that has been persisted in the Arrow IPC format or the Arrow File Format.
