The C standard doesn't *require* a particular behavior (for non-atomic integers).  Each time this comes up in the committees, more strict requirements do not make it into the text.  For example, the recent for C++, “Signed Integers are Two’s Complement” does not require it, either:  | /Status-quo/ If a signed operation would naturally produce a value | that is not within the range of the result type, the behavior is | undefined.
