Session and query IDs are unique and random, but have not been documented or consistently treated as sensitive secrets. Therefore they may be exposed in logs or interfaces. They were also not generated with a cryptographically secure random number generator, so are vulnerable to random number generator attacks that predict future IDs based on past IDs.  Impala deployments with Apache Sentry or Apache Ranger authorization enabled may be vulnerable to privilege escalation if an authenticated attacker is able to hijack a session or query from another authenticated user with privileges not assigned to the attacker.  Impala deployments with audit logging enabled may be vulnerable to incorrect audit logging as a user could undertake actions that were logged under the name of a different authenticated user.  Constructing an attack requires a high degree of technical sophistication and access to the Impala system as an authenticated user.  Mitigation: If an Impala deployment uses Apache Sentry, Apache Ranger or audit logging, then users should upgrade to a version of Impala with the fix for The Impala release includes this fix. This implements session secrets that eliminate the risk of any attack using this mechanism.  In lieu of an upgrade, restricting access to debug pages, administrative interfaces and logs that expose session and query IDs will reduce but not eliminate the risk of an attack. Restricting access to the Impala deployment to trusted users will also reduce the risk of an attack   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
