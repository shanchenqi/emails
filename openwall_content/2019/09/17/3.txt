This one https://github.com/trusteddomainproject/OpenDMARC/pull/45 caught my attention.  Quote: "Fix a few potential crashes      Fix missing from_domain check for store_dkim     Add checks for longer than buffer while parsing record"   This seems to add and fix a few length checks for buffers, i.e. fixing buffer overflows. I haven't analyzed it in detail.  --  Hanno Bรถck https://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
