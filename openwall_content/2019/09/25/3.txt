More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  / Jenkins form controls include an expandable textbox that can transform from a single-line text box to a multi-line text area.  The implementation of this transformation interpreted the text content of the form field as HTML. This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the contents of such f:expandableTextbox form controls.   / Jenkins interpreted items added to f:combobox form controls as HTML. This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the contents of f:combobox form controls.   (1) / Jenkins did not escape the tag name on the tooltip for tag actions shown in the build history. This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the SCM tag name for these actions.   (2) / Jenkins did not escape the reason a queue item is blocked in tooltips. This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the reason a queue item is blocked, for example a label expression that does not match idle executors.   / Jenkins shows various technical information about the current user on the /whoAmI URL. The information shown includes HTTP request headers.  This allowed attackers able to exploit another cross-site scripting vulnerability to obtain the Cookie headerâs value even if the HttpOnly flag would prevent direct access via JavaScript.   / Jenkins did not validate or otherwise limit the possible values administrators could specify as Jenkins root URL.  This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by users with Overall/Administer permission.   / Mask Passwords Plugin allows users to define secret environment variables (typically passwords) to be passed to builds, both globally, and for specific jobs. These environment variables are expected to not be shown.  Project Inheritance Plugin showed the variable values on its Full Build Flow view and included them in the metadata download without masking.   / (CSRF), (permission check) Project Inheritance Plugin allows the creation of projects based on templates defined in the plugin configuration.  A missing permission check in the HTTP endpoint triggering project creation allowed users with Overall/Read permission to create these projects. Additionally, the HTTP endpoint did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.   / Log Parser Plugin did not escape an error message shown when log parsing patterns are invalid. This resulted in a persisted cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the log parsing rules configuration, typically users with Job/Configure permission.  Jenkins applies the missing escaping by default since and LTS so newer Jenkins releases are not affected by this vulnerability.   / NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner Plugin stored registry credentials unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed by users with access to the master file system.   / Aqua MicroScanner Plugin stores a token credential in its global Jenkins configuration.  While the token is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form. This could result in exposure of the token through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.   / Aqua Security Scanner Plugin stores a password in its global Jenkins configuration.  While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form. This could result in exposure of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.   / Inedo BuildMaster Plugin Plugin stores a service password in its global Jenkins configuration.  While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form. This could result in exposure of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.   / Inedo ProGet Plugin Plugin stores a service password in its global Jenkins configuration.  While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form. This could result in exposure of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.   / Data Theorem: CI/CD Plugin stored a proxy password unencrypted in job config.xml files on the Jenkins master. This password could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission, or access to the master file system.   / Git Changelog Plugin stored MediaWiki and Jira passwords unencrypted in job config.xml files on the Jenkins master. These passwords could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission, or access to the master file system.   / GitLab Logo Plugin stored a private token unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins master. This token could be viewed by users with access to the master file system.   / (global password), (job password) Violation Comments to GitLab Plugin stored API tokens unencrypted in job config.xml files and its global configuration file on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission, or access to the master file system.   (1) / Kubernetes :: Pipeline :: Kubernetes Steps Plugin defines a custom whitelist for all scripts protected by the Script Security sandbox.  This custom whitelist allows the use of methods that can be used to bypass Script Security sandbox protection. This results in arbitrary code execution on any Jenkins instance with this plugin installed.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   (2) / Kubernetes :: Pipeline :: Arquillian Steps Plugin defines a custom whitelist for all scripts protected by the Script Security sandbox.  This custom whitelist allows the use of methods that can be used to bypass Script Security sandbox protection. This results in arbitrary code execution on any Jenkins instance with this plugin installed.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / vFabric Application Director Plugin stores the Application Director password unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins master. This password can be viewed by users with access to the master file system.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / Assembla Plugin stores the Assembla password unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins master. This password can be viewed by users with access to the master file system.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / Azure Event Grid Build Notifier Plugin stores the Azure Event Grid secret key unencrypted in job config.xml files on the Jenkins master. This key can be viewed by users with Extended Read permission, or access to the master file system.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / Call Remote Job Plugin stores a password unencrypted in job config.xml files on the Jenkins master. This password can be viewed by users with Extended Read permission, or access to the master file system.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / CodeScan Plugin stores an API key unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins master. This API key can be viewed by users with access to the master file system.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / elOyente Plugin stores a password unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins master. This password can be viewed by users with access to the master file system.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / Google Calendar Plugin stores a calendar password unencrypted in job config.xml files on the Jenkins master. This password can be viewed by users with Extended Read permission, or access to the master file system.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / Gem Publisher Plugin stores an API key unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins master. This API key can be viewed by users with access to the master file system.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
