We were previously aware of this vulnerability and have already been watching it for some time, but we will not disclose it here because the software in question is not developed by ProtonMail, and it has not yet been patched by the software maintainers. This vulnerability, however, is not widely known and indicates a higher level of sophistication on the part of the attackers."  After asking protonmail multiple times for a statement they answered and I learned that it's about this issue in OpenDMARC: https://github.com/trusteddomainproject/OpenDMARC/pull/48  It's an issue where by specifying multiple From addresses only one of them gets DMARC-checked.  There's no reaction from the OpenDMARC developers and it's unclear whether it's still actively developed. Given this is already actively exploited I think people should be aware of it and distros should probably apply the patch from the PR.  --  Hanno Bรถck https://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
