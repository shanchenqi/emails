This could be considered to be a denial of service vulnerability since PMF is supposed to protect from this type of issues. It should be noted that if PMF is not enabled, there would be no protocol level protection against this type of denial service attacks.  An attacker in radio range of the access point could inject a specially constructed unauthenticated IEEE frame to the access point to cause associated stations to be disconnected and require a reconnection to the network.   Vulnerable versions/configurations  All hostapd and wpa_supplicants versions with PMF support and a runtime configuration enabled AP mode with PMF being enabled (optional or required). In addition, this would be applicable only when using user space based MLME/SME in AP mode, i.e., when hostapd (or wpa_supplicant when controlling AP mode) would process authentication and association management frames. This condition would be applicable mainly with drivers that use   Possible mitigation steps  - Merge the following commit to wpa_supplicant/hostapd and rebuild:    AP: Silently ignore management frame from unexpected source address    This patch is available from  - Update to wpa_supplicant/hostapd or newer, once available  --  Jouni Malinen                                            PGP id  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
