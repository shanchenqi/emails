This issue here is exposed by the "webtools/control/httpService" URL, and uses Java deserialization to perform code execution. In the HttpEngine, the value of the request parameter "serviceContext" is passed to the "deserialize" method of "XmlSerializer".  Ofbiz is affected via two different dependencies: "commons-beanutils" and an out-dated version of "commons-fileupload"  Mitigation: Upgrade to or manually apply the commits from AND on branch 16 ----  Credit: Man Yue Mo of the Semmle Security Research Team ricterzheng(郑杜涛) <ricterzheng@...cent.com>  References: http://ofbiz.apache.org/download.html#vulnerabilities   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
