But that's Exim configuration, not hard-enforced in the code.  "Be lenient in what you accept" ... bah humbug.  Exim's default configuration has included this check, at RCPT time (which still works for our purposes) since commit in included in releases onwards.  So I use the HELO ACL and it's safe in "many" configurations, but we have to be more cautious in recommending mitigating workarounds.  -Phil  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
