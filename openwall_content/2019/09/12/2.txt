The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * Aqua Security Serverless Scanner Plugin * Beaker builder Plugin * Build Environment Plugin 1.7 * Dashboard View Plugin * Git client Plugin * Script Security Plugin  Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  / Git client Plugin accepts user-specified values as argument to an invocation  of `git ls-remote` to validate the existence of a Git repository at the  specified URL. This was implemented in a way that allowed attackers with Job/Configure permission to execute an arbitrary system command on the  Jenkins master as the OS user that the Jenkins process is running as.   / Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin could be circumvented through  any of the following:  - Crafted method names in method call expressions - Crafted property names in property expressions on the left-hand side of    assignment expressions - Crafted property names in property expressions in increment and decrement    expressions - Crafted subexpressions in increment and decrement expressions not    involving actual assignment  This allowed attackers able to specify and run sandboxed scripts to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins master JVM.   / Build Environment Plugin did not escape values of environment variables  shown on its views. This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability  exploitable by attackers able to control the values of build environment  variables, typically users with Job/Configure or Job/Build permission.   / Dashboard View Plugin did not escape the build description on the Latest  Builds View. This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability  exploitable by attackers able to control the description of builds shown on  that view.   / Aqua Security Serverless Scanner Plugin stores service passwords in job  configurations.  While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain  text as part of the configuration form. This could result in exposure of the  password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities,  and similar situations.   / Beaker builder Plugin stored the Beaker password unencrypted on the Jenkins  master. This password could be viewed by users with access to the master  file system.
