Details =======  There is a heap-based buffer overflow in string_vformat (string.c). The currently known exploit uses a extraordinary long EHLO string to crash the Exim process that is receiving the message. While at this mode of operation Exim already dropped its privileges, other paths to reach the vulnerable code may exist.  Mitigation ==========  There is - beside updating the server - no known mitigation.  Fix ===  Download and build the fixed version      Tarballs: https://ftp.exim.org/pub/exim/exim4/     Git:      https://github.com/Exim/exim.git (mirror)                 git://git.exim.org/exim.git               - tag                  - branch  The tagged commit is the officially released version. The +fixes branch isn't officially maintained, but contains the security fix *and* useful fixes.  The tarballs, the Git tag, and the Git commits are signed with my GPG key (same as I used to sign this mail.)  If you can't install the above versions, ask your package maintainer for a version containing the backported fix. On request and depending on our resources we will support you in backporting the fix.  (Please note, the Exim project officially doesn't support versions prior the current stable version.)
