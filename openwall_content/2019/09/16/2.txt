In the immediate term, yes, it's easy to see potential benefits. In the long term, it will harm people.  >If a user of the software took the "delete" claim at face value then it >could be considered security related ..  Second line of the original email: "This is not a security vulnerability itâs a privacy issue."  >and unlike Snapchat, the Telegram client *is* open source.  The Telegram ecosystem is closed-source.  Regardless, Telegram clients don't have to respect this setting, so the feature is a lie. The only way to enforce message deletion is through drm-like means (Snapchat...), which doesn't work anyway. That Telegram allows third-party clients only makes it worse, in a way.
