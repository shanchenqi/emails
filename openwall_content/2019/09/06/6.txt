How would the deny in MAIL FROM prevent the exploit? What I have understand is that there is exploit in the SNI of the TLS negotiation, thus the whole connect attempt must be rejected right?  -----Ursprungligt meddelande----- Från: Exim-users <exim-users-bounces+sebastian=sebbe.eu@...m.org> För Heiko Schlittermann via Exim-users Skickat: den 6 september Till: oss-security <oss-security@...ts.openwall.com>; Exim Users <exim-users@...m.org> Ämne: Re: [exim] Exim - local or remote attacker can execute programs with root privileges  An Update to the mitigation for the current CVE:  Add - as part of the mail ACL (the ACL referenced by the main config option "acl_smtp_mail"):       deny    condition = ${if eq{\\}{${substr{-1}{1}{$tls_in_sni}}}}      deny    condition = ${if eq{\\}{${substr{-1}{1}{$tls_in_peerdn}}}}  This should prevent the currently known attack vector.
