Many oss-fuzz "security" issues are not CVE-worthy although they are  bugs worthy to spend time fixing.  At least as pertains to the Debian project, I do feel that someone is  looking at each security issue I fix and creating CVEs for serious  issues.  A CVE summary page for GraphicsMagick is maintained at  https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/graphicsmagick.  > This is in addition to the security bugs OSS-Fuzz found and publicly > disclosed due to hitting their disclosure deadline, and which still have > not been fixed [3].  Security bugs are often very hard to diagnose and fix.  The community  has become much better at producing bug reports than with helping to  solve the problems found.  Help with actually fixing issues is  appreciated.  I think that the objective should be open source  software which lacks bugs and still provides a useful purpose.  Finding bugs is just part of the effort.
