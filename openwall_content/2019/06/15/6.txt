A combination of compiler sanitizers and better fuzzing techniques has scaled up bug finding and fixing to a level we haven't had before.  For distributions that promise to backport all security fixes that creates a situation where it's almost impossible to keep that promise, they just don't have the manpower to scale up at the same speed as people find bugs. Maybe the main takeaway here is to just recognize that, and maybe distros should be more honest here and be clear what they can and can't do. And if you run a parser in a high risk environment you may not want to rely on the outdated version shipping in some LTS distribution.   But I also think it's good to keep some perspective of the bugs we're talking about. Many of the bugs oss-fuzz finds are of bug classes where it's quite unlikely that they directly lead to a security issue (e.g. out of bounds memory reads - which asan controversially calls "overflows"). Even for the scarier looking vulns like write buffer overflows and use after free the situation is that these are usually not straightforward to exploit. All modern distributions have a combination of stack canaries, ASLR and nonexecutable memory. It's my understanding that while it's often possible to bypass those, doing so in non-scripting scenarios (e.g. in an image parser) is really hard and often impossible.  I guess therefore it's still an overall win. While there's a number of bugs unfixed with public information, in the long term we'll get more robust code and the number of bugs present should be in steep decline.   --  Hanno Bรถck https://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
