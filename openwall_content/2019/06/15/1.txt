Not only does it use MD5, but its source of entropy is weak and does two rounds of hashing. From the source code[1]:      $session->{data}->{_session_id} =         {}. rand(). $$)), 0, $length);  (where $length is 32 by default)  Am I missing something, or has this code actually been in use for ages and gone unnoticed ? I couldn't find any CVE for this.  So far I found this reference, but only mentions the use of MD5 as a weakness:  >From a quick look at the reverse dependencies of the Debian package, there are some users of Apache::Session: * RequestTracker (RT) : from a quick look at the session id in the cookie set by rt.cpan.org I'd say it does use Generate::MD5 * Torrus: no idea if the Generate::MD5 module is used * LemonLdap::NG : they replaced Generate::MD5 by a similar code using but still using two rounds of hashing  CC'ing BestPractical. Will open an issue on LemonLdap::NG's gitlab.
