Of special mention is a bug reported to us by "Battle Furry" via our  security mail alias.  This bug (was considered to be a "feature")  allows including file text as rendered text on a graphic image, or as  text hidden in metadata, by using a file refered to with '@...ename'  syntax where text to be rendered normally appears.  This issue was  inherited from ImageMagick and it even appears in ImageMagick   It has been determined that the SVG and WMF formats may be used to  supply this '@...ename' syntax, resulting in rendered text on a  graphic image, or as text hidden in metadata (e.g. the image comment).  Furthermore, it may be that other applications and web sites accept  text to be rendered on behalf of users and that this issue could allow  untrusted users to receive content considered to be secure and private  (e.g. private keys or passwords).  A small patch to fix this issue is attached.  Any distribution of  GraphicsMagick needs this patch if it is not possible to upgrade to  the latest release.
