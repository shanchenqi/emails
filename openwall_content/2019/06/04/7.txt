I guess I wasn't the only one wondering how revealing this is, so:  $ diff -urwx doc | diffstat -s  files changed, insertions(+), deletions(-) $ diff -urwx doc | wc      lists tens of changes.  Exim appears to have been released in February, when the security issue referred to here was not yet known as such, so this wasn't a deliberate decision to release the fix publicly yet keep it unmentioned.  Keeping the issue in this semi-public state for 7 days feels weird to me, but given the above it doesn't look too unrealistic that the issue won't be rediscovered during this time period.  (The risk of leaks is probably higher.)  It'd be curious if someone ends up discovering a different and yet unknown security issue by reading that diff. ;-)  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
