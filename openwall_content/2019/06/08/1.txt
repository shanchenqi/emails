However, on the second run, the container will run as UID 0 (aka root) which can be an undesired escalated privilege.   Pods that specify an explicit runAsUser are unaffected and continue to work properly.  PodSecurityPolicies that force a runAsUser setting are also unaffected and continue to work properly.  Pods that specify mustRunAsNonRoot:true will refuse to start the container as uid 0, which can affect availability.  This issue is filed as See for more details.   **Am I vulnerable?**   Run this to print out all nodes and their kubelet version:    kubectl get nodes -o=jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.status.nodeInfo.machineID}{"\t"}{.status.nodeInfo.kubeletVersion}{"\n"}{end}'   If the output lists Kubelet versions listed below you are running a vulnerable version:    *   *     *   *   *   *     *   **How do I mitigate the vulnerability?**   There are two potential mitigations to this issue:     *   *   Downgrade to kubelet or   *   as instructed by your Kubernetes distribution.   *   *   *   Set RunAsUser on all pods in the cluster   *   that should not run as root. This is a Security Context feature; the docs are at   *     *   **How do I upgrade?**   An upgrade addressing this issue is not yet available. But, will appear in and ASAP and will be announced here.   **Thank you**   Thank you to and Tim Pepper as release manager for the coordination in making this announcement.
