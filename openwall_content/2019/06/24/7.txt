Going forward, the best plan is for more projects to include fuzzing as part of the build process testing.  Question: is fuzzing useful for languages like Java/python?  Obviously, you eventually reach a native code module in both cases, but fuzzing  the entire virtual machine is cumbersome.  Maybe native code libraries for "safe" languages should include fuzzing as part of testing.  --   	      Stuart D.
