Sorry for confusion about the public release. We were forced to react, as details leaked.  The patch should apply cleanly to all affected versions We do not do a security release, as the official Exim version is at already and older releases are considered to be outdated and not supported by the developers anymore.  Please do not hesitate to contact us if you need help backporting the fix.
