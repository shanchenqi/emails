Joe Vennix of Apple Information Security discovered an implementation flaw in the DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 authentication mechanism. A malicious client with write access to its own home directory could manipulate a ~/.dbus-keyrings symlink to cause a DBusServer with a different uid to read and write in unintended locations. In the worst case, this could result in the DBusServer reusing a cookie that is known to the malicious client, and treating that cookie as evidence that a subsequent client connection came from an attacker-chosen uid, allowing authentication bypass.  This vulnerability does not normally affect the standard system dbus-daemon, which only allows the EXTERNAL authentication mechanism. In supported branches of dbus it also does not normally affect the standard session dbus-daemon, for the same reason.  However, this vulnerability can affect third-party users of DBusServer (such as Upstart in Ubuntu LTS), third-party dbus-daemon instances, standard dbus-daemon instances with non-standard configuration, and the session bus in older/unsupported dbus branches (such as dbus 1.6.x in Ubuntu LTS).  Recommendations ---------------  Fix the vulnerability by upgrading to a fixed dbus version, or by applying upstream git commit which should be suitable for all recent branches. This resolves the vulnerability by rejecting attempts to authenticate with DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 as any user ID that is not the owner of the process with the DBusServer.  A further git commit "test: Add basic test coverage for DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1" (available in different versions for the and master branches) adds basic unit test coverage, which is not required but might be useful.  As additional hardening, we recommend that D-Bus servers on Unix platforms should only listen on AF_UNIX sockets, and that they should pass the array {"EXTERNAL", NULL} to dbus_server_set_auth_mechanisms() immediately after the DBusServer is created (before polling the server's socket), so that only EXTERNAL (credentials-passing) authentication is allowed. This is not the default behaviour of a DBusServer for compatibility reasons. In dbus-daemon(1) this can be achieved by having <auth>EXTERNAL</auth> as the only <auth> element in the configuration, similar to the standard system.conf and session.conf on Unix platforms. This hardening would have made the vulnerability inaccessible.  Distributors who are maintaining an unsupported branch should apply that hardening to the standard session bus (dbus-daemon --session) by backporting upstream commit from dbus if they have not done so already.  Unsupported branches --------------------  As announced in dbus 1.8.x, 1.6.x and all older branches have reached end-of-life and no longer receive upstream security support. There will not be releases from those branches to fix this vulnerability. If your long-term-supported distribution relies on one of these branches, and you would like to use the upstream dbus git repository to share tested patches with other distributions in the same situation, please contact the dbus maintainers via <dbus-security@...ts.freedesktop.org>.
