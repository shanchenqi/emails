I guess this is a distinction between all open deadline-exceeded issues and only deemed security ones out of those (38).  Removing "Type=Bug-Security status:New", but keeping "label:Deadline-exceeded" does show issues for ImageMagick.  Also removing "label:Deadline-exceeded" still results in perhaps because I'm not authorized to see other open issues.  I am unfamiliar with OSS-Fuzz.  Please correct me if I got this wrong.
