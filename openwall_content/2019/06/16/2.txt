There are surely issues  that I can not see yet since they are hidden for up to 90 days.  Taking the number that would mean that there is a huge number of  issues already fixed which are gradually making it out to  users.  This is too many fixes to deal with via distribution-specific  patches.  Using my privileged access for GraphicsMagick, I currently see  issues in total, with 12 issues remaining to fix.  Some of those 12  issues are open to the public for some time now. :-(  Bob --  Bob Friesenhahn bfriesen@...ple.dallas.tx.us, http://www.simplesystems.org/users/bfriesen/ GraphicsMagick Maintainer,    http://www.GraphicsMagick.org/ Public Key,     http://www.simplesystems.org/users/bfriesen/public-key.txt  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
