We encourage all users of Django to upgrade as soon as possible.  AdminURLFieldWidget XSS =======================================  The clickable "Current URL" link generated by ``AdminURLFieldWidget`` displayed the provided value without validating it as a safe URL. Thus, an unvalidated value stored in the database, or a value provided as a URL query parameter payload, could result in an clickable JavaScript link.  ``AdminURLFieldWidget`` now validates the provided value using ``URLValidator`` before displaying the clickable link. You may customise the validator by passing a ``validator_class`` kwarg to ``AdminURLFieldWidget.__init__()``, e.g. when using ``ModelAdmin.formfield_overrides``.  Affected versions -----------------  * Django master development branch * Django 2.2 before version * Django 2.1 before version * Django before version  Patched bundled jQuery for Prototype pollution ==============================================================  jQuery before mishandles ``jQuery.extend(true, {}, ...)`` because of ``Object.prototype`` pollution. If an unsanitized source object contained an enumerable ``__proto__`` property, it could extend the native ``Object.prototype``.  The bundled version of jQuery used by the Django admin has been patched to allow for the ``select2`` library's use of ``jQuery.extend()``.  Affected versions -----------------  * Django master development branch * Django 2.2 before version * Django 2.1 before version  Resolution ==========  Patches to resolve these issues have been applied to Django's master branch and the 2.2, 2.1, and release branches. The patches may be obtained from the following changesets:  On the master branch:  * `Admin XSS * `jQuery prototype pollution  On the 2.2 release branch:  * `Admin XSS * `jQuery prototype pollution  On the 2.1 release branch:  * `Admin XSS * `jQuery prototype pollution  On the release branch:  * `Admin XSS  The following releases have been issued:  * Django (`download Django | checksums * Django (`download Django | checksums * Django (`download Django | checksums   The PGP key ID used for these releases is Carlton Gibson:  General notes regarding security reporting ==========================================  As always, we ask that potential security issues be reported via private email to ``security@...ngoproject.com``, and not via Django's Trac instance or the django-developers list.
