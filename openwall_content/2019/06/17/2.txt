Which is more worrisome in the specific case of lemonldap-ng given the use of rand for quite many things. Not sure how RT is affected in that regard.

FWIW I had opened issue [3] for the uses of String::Random, but it looks like it is best to just reopen - or whatever is necessary so that the remaining uses of rand are fixed.  Oh and it appears that Apache::SessionX is a fork of Apache::Session, with the same session id generation function.
