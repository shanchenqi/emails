For example, when moving from GCC 6 series to GCC 7 series we found one of our code bases would produce a binary that would only segfault when compiled at >= -O2. We root caused this to exactly the situation you describe: an error handling path that read uninitialized variables. The compiler appeared to infer backwards that the error check itself was a no-op as the true branch led to unconditional UB (this is my interpretation of its actions; I did not delve into the compilerâs internals). Well, as a GCC developer, I can say it doesn't use an uninitialized read to allow back-propagation of state to eliminate conditionals.  It may have looked that way, but there had to be something else going on.
