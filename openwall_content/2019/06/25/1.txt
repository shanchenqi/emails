Have you tried the gdb exploitable plugin yet?  https://github.com/jfoote/exploitable  Some of the tools written around AFL have included support for running exploitable directly on the fuzzer results and helping to prioritize, roughly, in what order the specimens should be worked on:  https://gitlab.com/rc0r/afl-utils  with a direct link to a pretty screenshot:  https://gitlab.com/rc0r/afl-utils/raw/master/.scrots/afl_collect_sample.png  I assume like most such tools, this is another case of being a good start but not nearly as reliable as a knowledgeable human. It's also probably completely useless for issues that aren't memory-safety issues. But it's something that exists today and may be helpful.
