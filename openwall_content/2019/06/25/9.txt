I think that almost all bugs are issues worth addressing given  sufficent resources available to address them.  The issue discussed is  what proportion of bugs discovered via automated testing and claimed  to be "security" issues based on computer analysis are exploitable  vulnerabilities which deserve a CVE.  A good point has been made that Linux heap memory allocation behavior  may be very different than other OSs and that behavior can also be  hardware-specific.
