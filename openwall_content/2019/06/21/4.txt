So it's a matter of "do I live with all of the bugs that everyone else knows about and how to exploit, or do I live with a potential regression?"  That sounds like an easy choice given that the reason you should be updating is to resolve all of those known bugs :)  Regressions always happen, we are human, but there are ways to mitigate them (testing, roll-back, preventing developers from not breaking things on purpose, etc.)  And projects that do not do this type of work to prevent regressions need to learn that they should change, or users will go elsewhere.  thanks,  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
