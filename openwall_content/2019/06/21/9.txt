Exactly, other examples where Debian ships upstream stable branches when updating a stable/oldstable release (via security.debian.org or point releases) out of the top of my head are:  - ffmpeg - Firefox ESR - Linux (follows upstream LTS branches) - MariaDB - Mediawiki - OpenJDK - OpenSSL - PHP - Thunderbird ESR - VLC - Wireshark - Xen  It has served us very well overall and it's considered on a case-by-case basis; e.g. whether upstream releases in those long term branches are sufficiently vetted/regression-tested.
