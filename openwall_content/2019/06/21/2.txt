I sympathize with this view, and I think we need to get better at updating, but I really think not all projects can be “safely” just updated to the latest version. End-users and IT admins still value stability and regressions is still a thing in a lot of cases. And once a regression is introduced, it's not always a short time before it's fixed upstream.  And before reaching the end-user, some project latest versions might depend on a lot of “latest version” of other projects. In some case the dependency tree might involve large scale changes affecting the whole system.  So sure, in some cases it makes sense to just update to latest versions, but I' m really not sure it's the general case. I'm not entirely satisfied by the situation either but I don't have a magic way to fix it.
