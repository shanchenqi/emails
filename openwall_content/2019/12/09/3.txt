It's a fault on the human side.  If you call the above command in a typical Bourne shell, you should be prepared to handle the trouble. Smart admins don't do that.  If an application calls the above command via system(), you should file a bug against that application. Smart programmers know how to avoid the shell for such invocations (or avoid such invocations in the first place.)
