More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  / (XXE) & (CSRF) Maven Release Plug-in Plugin retrieves XML from Nexus repository manager APIs. Maven Release Plug-in Plugin and earlier does not configure the XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks. While Jenkins users without Overall/Administer permission are not allowed to configure a custom Nexus URL, this could still be exploited via man-in-the-middle attacks, especially if it's not an HTTPS URL.  Additionally, a connection test form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability. Combined, these two vulnerabilities allow attackers to have Jenkins parse crafted XML documents that use external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins master, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.   / (CSRF) & (missing permission check) Gerrit Trigger Plugin and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods performing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to perform connection tests, connecting to an HTTP URL or SSH server using attacker-specified credentials, or determine whether files with an attacker-specified path exist on the Jenkins master file system.  Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.   / (CSRF) & (missing permission check)  & (resource consumption) Build Failure Analyzer Plugin and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method performing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to supply a computationally expensive regular expression that will hang the request handling thread.  Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.   / Pipeline Aggregator View Plugin 1.8 and earlier does not escape the information shown on the view it provides, such as stage names or job names.  This results in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure jobs, define pipeline stages, or otherwise affect the information shown by Pipeline Aggregator View Plugin.   / Rundeck Plugin and earlier stores credentials as part of its global configuration file `org.jenkinsci.plugins.rundeck.RundeckNotifier.xml` and job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins master. These URLs could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission (in the case of job `config.xml` files) or access to the master file system.   / Redgate SQL Change Automation Plugin and earlier stores credentials unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins master as part of its build step configuration. These credentials can be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the master file system.   / Spira Importer Plugin and earlier unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate validation for the entire Jenkins master JVM.   / (permission check) & (CSRF) WebSphere Deployer Plugin and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods performing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to perform connection tests, determine whether files with an attacker-specified path exist on the Jenkins master file system, and obtain limited information about the Jenkins and plugin configuration based on the responses. The latter include the ability to set plugin configuration options.  Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / WebSphere Deployer Plugin and earlier allows users with Overall/Read access to disable SSL/TLS certificate and hostname validation for the entire Jenkins master JVM, or specify a new Java keystore from a file stored on the Jenkins master filesystem.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / buildgraph-view Plugin 1.8 and earlier does not escape the description of builds shown in its view.  This results in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability that can be exploited by users able to change the build description.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / Mission Control Plugin and earlier does not escape job display names and build names in the view it provides.  This results in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability that can be exploited by users able to change these properties.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   (1) / (CSRF) & (missing permission check) Team Concert Plugin and earlier does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.  Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   (2) / Team Concert Plugin and earlier provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.  This functionality does not correctly check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / SCTMExecutor Plugin 2.2 and earlier stores Silk Central credentials in the global Jenkins configuration and in job `config.xml` files.  While these credentials are stored encrypted on disk, they are transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form. This can result in exposure of these credentials through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / Mantis Plugin and earlier does not require POST requests on a connection test method, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability. This allows attackers to have Jenkins connect to Mantis-related paths on an attacker-specified web server using attacker-specified credentials.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / (CSRF) & (missing permission check) RapidDeploy Plugin 4.1 and earlier does not perform a permission check on form validation methods. This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to RapidDeploy-related paths on an attacker-specified web server.  Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / Weibo Plugin and earlier stores a credential unencrypted in its global configuration file `org.jenkinsci.plugins.weibo.WeiboNotifier.xml` on the Jenkins master. This credential can be viewed by users with access to the master file system.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / (CSRF) & (missing permission check) Alauda DevOps Pipeline Plugin and earlier does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to Kubernetes-related paths on an attacker-specified web server using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing token credentials managed by Alauda DevOps Pipeline Plugin.  Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / (CSRF) & (missing permission check) Alauda Kubernetes Suport Plugin and earlier does not require POST requests on a connection test method, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability. This allows attackers to have Jenkins connect to Kubernetes-related paths on an attacker-specified web server using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing 'Secret Text' credentials stored in Jenkins.  Additionally, if no credentials ID is specified, the connection uses the default Kubernetes token from `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token`.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.    Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
