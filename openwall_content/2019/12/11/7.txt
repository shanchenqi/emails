Updated metadata to add update StableRef's  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Please see for background on the MovSS shadow:    Please see for background on the need for #DB interception:    The VMX VMEntry checks does not like the exact combination of state which occurs when #DB in intercepted, Single Stepping is active, and blocked by STI/MovSS is active, despite this being a legitimate state to be in.  The resulting VMEntry failure is fatal to the guest.  IMPACT ======  HVM/PVH guest userspace code may be able to crash the guest, resulting in a guest Denial of Service.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All versions of Xen are affected.  Only systems supporting VMX hardware virtual extensions (Intel, Cyrix or Zhaoxin CPUs) are affected. Arm and AMD systems are unaffected.  Only HVM/PVH guests are affected.  PV guests cannot leverage the vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only PV guests will avoid this vulnerability.  Running HVM guests on only AMD hardware will also avoid this vulnerability.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by HÃ¥kon Alstadheim and diagnosed as a security issue by Andrew Cooper of Citrix.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.            xen-unstable, Xen .. Xen 4.8.x  $   $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----  =yTxW -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
