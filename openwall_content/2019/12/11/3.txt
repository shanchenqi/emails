Updated metadata to add update StableRef's  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  In a number of places bitmaps are being used by the hypervisor to track certain state.  Iteration over all bits involves functions which may misbehave in certain corner cases: - - On 32-bit Arm accesses to bitmaps with bit a count which is a multiple   of 32, an out of bounds access may occur.  - - On x86 accesses to bitmaps with a compile time known size of 64 may   incur undefined behavior, which may in particular result in infinite   loops.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest may cause a hypervisor crash or hang, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All versions of Xen are vulnerable.  32-bit Arm systems are vulnerable.  x86 systems with 64 or more nodes are vulnerable.  We are unaware of any such systems that Xen would run on.  64-bit Arm systems as well as x86 systems with less than 64 nodes are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  There is no known mitigation for 32-bit Arm systems.  For x86 systems the issue can be avoided by suppressing the use of NUMA information provided by firmware, via the "numa=off" command line option.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.            xen-unstable, Xen ... 4.8.x  $   $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
