Re-base patch onto latest stable tree commits.  Updated metadata to add update StableRef's  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  When running on AMD systems with an IOMMU, Xen attempted to dynamically adapt the number of levels of pagetables (the pagetable height) in the IOMMU according to the guest's address space size.  The code to select and update the height had several bugs.  Notably, the update was done without taking a lock which is necessary for safe operation.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest administrator can cause Xen to access data structures while they are being modified, causing Xen to crash. Privilege escalation is thought to be very difficult but cannot be ruled out.  Additionally, there is a potential memory leak of 4kb per guest boot, under memory pressure.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Only Xen on AMD CPUs is vulnerable.  Xen running on Intel CPUs is not vulnerable.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.  Only systems where guests are given direct access to physical devices are vulnerable.  Systems which do not use PCI pass-through are not vulnerable.  Only HVM guests can exploit the vulnerability.  PV and PVH guests cannot.  All versions of Xen with IOMMU support are vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  In some configurations, use of passthrough can be replaced with a higher-level protocol such as Xen PV block or network devices. There is no other mitigation.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Sander Eikelenboom, along with Andrew Cooper of Citrix.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate (set of) attached patch(es) resolves this issue.            xen-unstable, Xen      Xen      Xen    Xen     Xen 4.9.x     Xen 4.8.x  $           $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.   (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
