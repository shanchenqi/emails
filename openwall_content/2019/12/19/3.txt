My B-tree uses minimum unique key with leading duplicates not stored for all but the leaf nodes - so it would also (eventually - there is so much noise in the timing measurement) give away the key via timing attacks.    I had not thought of that angle, and I hope I remember this the next time I am reinventing session ids.  Now I'm also wondering about other libraries that manage session ids.
