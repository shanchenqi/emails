TigerVNC security update  Hello,  This is a final report about reviewing open source VNC implementations. This research has been motivated by the fact that some VNC systems are heavily used in ICS.  About a year ago I have already sent an email to this mailing list about TightVNC and LibVNC vulnerabilities: Later this year I had some time to review more open source implementations of VNC systems (mostly UltraVNC), which are described in this article:  Finally, today TigerVNC team managed to fix all issues found within their codebase and published fixes in new release  Fix contains patches for several vulnerabilities that have been fixed in master branch only, and 5 vulnerabilities -- that actually got into the previous release. CVE-ids will published shortly. Please update.  Also, I accidently found another heap buffer overflow in LibVNC when I was playing with CodeQL queries. It was missed during previous analysis by me. It later turned out that my fuzzer didn't find it either, because it required at least to be sent over the network to trigger it :)  Best Regards, Pavel Cheremushkin Security Researcher| ICS CERT Vulnerability Research Group |Â Kaspersky Lab 39A bld.2 Leningradskoye Highway, Moscow Russia |Â www.kaspersky.com,www.securelist.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
