Potential account hijack via password reset form ================================================================  By submitting a suitably crafted email address making use of Unicode characters, that compared equal to an existing user email when  lower-cased for comparison, an attacker could be sent a password reset token for the matched account.  In order to avoid this vulnerability, password reset requests now  compare the submitted email using the stricter, recommended algorithm for  case-insensitive comparison of two identifiers from `Unicode Technical Report 36, section Upon a match, the email containing the reset token will be sent to the email address on record rather than the submitted address.  .. __: https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr36/#Recommendations_General  Affected supported versions ===========================  * Django master branch * Django 3.0 * Django 2.2 * Django 2.1  Resolution ==========  Patches to resolve the issue have been applied to Django's master branch and the 3.0, 2.2, and release branches.

This issue was known publicly, therefore we fixed the issue as soon as  possible without the usual `prenotification process  <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/security/#how-django-discloses-security-issues>`_.
