I'm happy to finally announce the new release of OpenSC. You can read a full summary of the changes and get the release binaries on GitHub  We've extended our continuous testing by fuzzing the code with OSS-Fuzz <https://google.github.io/oss-fuzz>. It is running billions of tests each weak and has found around unique crashes, most notable the security issues tracked as and Getting our hands on all the problems reported by the fuzzing was very challenging. Special thanks to Jakub Jelen, who spend many hours on analyzing and fixing many of the issues.  Regards, Frank Morgner.
