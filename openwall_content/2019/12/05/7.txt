ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  relies on the use of libxl's "assignable-add" feature to prepare devices to be assigned to untrusted guests.  Unfortunately, this is not considered a strictly required step for device assignment.  The PCI passthrough documentation on the wiki describes alternate ways of preparing devices for assignment, and libvirt uses its own ways as well.  Hosts where these "alternate" methods are used will still leave the system in a vulnerable state after the device comes back from a guest.  IMPACT ======  An untrusted domain with access to a physical device can DMA into host memory, leading to privilege escalation.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Only systems where guests are given direct access to physical devices capable of DMA (PCI pass-through) are vulnerable.  Systems which do not use PCI pass-through are not vulnerable.  Only systems which use "alternate" methods to assign devices to pciback before assignment are vulnerable.  These methods include:  - Assigning devices on the Linux command-line using `xen-pciback.hide`  - Assigning devices via xen-pciback module parameters  - Assigning devices manually via sysfs  - Assigning devices using libvirt  Systems which use `xl pci-assignable-add` or libxl_device_pci_assignable_add, or have the assignable state handled automatically via setting the `seize` parameter, are not affected.  MITIGATION ==========  For xl and libvirt, before assigning a device to a guest, manually run `xl pci-assignable-add`.  This will quarantine the device even if the device has already been assigned to pciback by one of the alternate methods.  This may also work for other libxl-based toolstacks, depending on the particular implementation.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Marek Marczykowski-Gรณrecki of Invisible Things Lab.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.  Note that this patch will quarantine the device after the domain is destroyed by default.  It must be un-quarantined before it can be used by domain 0 again.  This can be done by executing `xl pci-assignable-remove`.  This will be effective even if the device was assigned to pciback with one of the alternate methods.            xen-unstable      Xen      Xen Xen       Xen 4.9.x, Xen 4.8.x  $      $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.   (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
