A Velocity template can be provided through Velocity (.vm) templates in a configset `velocity/` directory or as a parameter.  A user defined configset could contain renderable, potentially malicious, templates. Parameter provided templates are disabled by default, but can be enabled by setting `params.resource.loader.enabled` by defining a response writer with that setting set to `true`.  Defining a response writer requires configuration API access.  Solr 8.4 removed the params resource loader entirely, and only enables the configset-provided template rendering when the configset is `trusted` (has been uploaded by an authenticated user).  Mitigation: Ensure your network settings are configured so that only trusted traffic  communicates with Solr, especially to the configuration APIs.
