More CVEs for bugs in Linux kernel USB drivers that can be triggered by an external malicious USB device. Found with syzkaller [1]. This time no obvious DoSs (see the discussions here [2, 3]): mostly UAFs, some info-leaks. All of these bugs have been fixed upstream (but many other syzbot USB bugs are still not fixed [4]).
