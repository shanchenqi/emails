If you think so, please report it to the maintainers of logind (which is the component that would have to change to address this).  I would have expected this to be gated by a check that the uid of the caller (the D-Bus client, in this case the dbus-send process) matches the uid of the current VT on that seat (so you can voluntarily switch away from your own session, but other users can't force you to), or a polkit check that the caller is root-equivalent, or some combination of those. In particular, checking that the uid matches the VT's owner's uid would be enough to let unprivileged X and Wayland servers implement the expected "switch to other VT" handling for      smcv  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
