The memory copied is that of the configured push link header values, not data supplied by the client.   Mitigation: All httpd users deploying mod_http2 should upgrade to or later. Unpatched servers can disable HTTP/2 push with the "H2Push off" directive.  Credit: The issue was discovered by Craig Young of Tripwire VERT, <vuln-report@...ur3.us>.
