Red Hats kernel has a flaw in overlayfs which can cause a kernel panic and possibly memory corruption.  An attacker with local access can create a denial of service situation via NULL pointer dereference in ovl_posix_acl_create function in fs/overlayfs/dir.c. The ovl_create function can return a positive number leading to a null pointer derference of path in may_open. This can allow attackers with ability to create directories on overlayfs to crash the kernel creating a Denial Of Service (DOS) and possibly other memory corruption.  The memory corruption claim may be a bit of a stretch, but it could be possible that an attacker could pre-groom the memory where the null pointer dereference exists, but I couldn't get this to work in practice, YMMV.  This flaw likely only affects Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 based products as this issue was created by by human-error in the back-porting process.  It is very unlikely that non Red Hat Enterprise Linux derived distributions contain this flaw.
