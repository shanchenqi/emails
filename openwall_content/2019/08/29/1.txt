To correct these vulnerabilities new releases of Kea were issued:     -  Kea    -  Kea    -  Kea  any of which can be downloaded via the ISC downloads page, https://www.isc.org/downloads.  If you are a distributor of packages based on ISC's Kea DHCP software, you may consider the issue publicly disclosed and proceed with your own packages.
