The vulnerabilities can result in a DoS against any process with an HTTP or HTTPS listener.    Am I vulnerable?    Yes. All versions of Kubernetes are affected.   Go has released versions and and we have released the following versions of Kubernetes built using patched versions of Go.    ·         Kubernetes -  ·         Kubernetes -  ·         Kubernetes -   How do I mitigate the vulnerability?   Upgrade to a patched version of Kubernetes, listed above.   How do I upgrade?    When new versions are released, you can follow the upgrade instructions at https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/cluster-management/#upgrading-a-cluster    Vulnerability details    Netflix recently announced a security advisory that identified several Denial of Service attack vectors that can affect server implementations of the HTTP/2 protocol, and has issued eight CVEs. [1]    Go is affected by two of the vulnerabilities and and so Kubernetes components that serve HTTP/2 traffic (including /healthz) are also affected. [2]    These vulnerabilities allow untrusted clients to allocate an unlimited amount of memory, until the server crashes. The Product Security Committee has assigned this set of vulnerabilities with a CVSS score of 7.5 [3]    [1].  [2].  [3].    Thank you   Thanks to Jonathan Looney from Netflix for discovering and reporting these issues to the Go community.    Thanks to Christoph Blecker, Benjamin Elder, and Tim Pepper for coordinating the fix and release.    Thank You,    Micah Hausler on behalf of the Kubernetes Product Security Committee    Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
