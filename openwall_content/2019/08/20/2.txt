I've previously reported vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel USB drivers on this list [1] found with syzkaller [2]. The USB fuzzing project has been on hold for a while, but has been resumed earlier this year. Here's a new bunch of 15 CVEs.  As an experiment this time I've requested CVEs for 2 bugs that haven't yet been fixed (fixes for the other 13 bugs are in the upstream kernel). Both have been reported by syzbot over 4 months ago. I've made sure that these 2 bugs are reproducible with a crafted USB device and crash a Linux laptop (or rather crash the USB worker thread) with one of the distro kernels.  There are many more still not fixed bugs shown here [3].

This is related to sound/core/init.c and sound/core/info.c.  *  An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before There is a use-after-free caused by a malicious USB device in the drivers/media/usb/cpia2/cpia2_usb.c driver.  *  An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before There is a NULL pointer dereference caused by a malicious USB device in the drivers/usb/misc/yurex.c driver.  *  An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before There is a NULL pointer dereference caused by a malicious USB device in the driver.  *  An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before There is a NULL pointer dereference caused by a malicious USB device in the drivers/media/usb/siano/smsusb.c driver.  *  An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before There is a NULL pointer dereference caused by a malicious USB device in the drivers/usb/misc/sisusbvga/sisusb.c driver.  *  An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before There is a use-after-free caused by a malicious USB device in the driver.  *  An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before There is a NULL pointer dereference caused by a malicious USB device in the sound/usb/line6/pcm.c driver.  *  An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before There is a NULL pointer dereference caused by a malicious USB device in the sound/usb/helper.c (motu_microbookii) driver.  *  An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before There is a NULL pointer dereference caused by a malicious USB device in the sound/usb/line6/driver.c driver.
