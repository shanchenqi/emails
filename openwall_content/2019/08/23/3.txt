No one has said anything about not fixing these bugs.  The Linux USB developers have been spending a lot of time in the past weeks doing just that, so please do not think that is an issue here.  Now the "mount a purposfully corrupted filesystem image" issues, that's another story :)  CERT has a long-running thread with a number of kernel developers about issues they have found in that area over the past years, which has not lead to many fixes for various reasons :(  thanks,  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
