[PRODUCT]:Apache Santuario - XML Security for Java [VERSION]:All 2.0.x releases from all 2.1.x releases before [PROBLEMTYPE]:Process Control [REFERENCES]: [DESCRIPTION]:In version of Apache Santuario XML Security for Java, a caching mechanism               was introduced to speed up creating new XML documents using a static pool of               DocumentBuilders.                However, if some untrusted code can register a malicious implementation with               the thread context class loader first, then this implementation might be               cached and re-used by Apache Santuario - XML Security for Java, leading to               potential security flaws when validating signed documents, etc.  For more information, please see the security advisories page of Apache Santuario: http://santuario.apache.org/secadv.html  --  Colm O hEigeartaigh  Talend Community Coder http://coders.talend.com   --  Colm O hEigeartaigh  Talend Community Coder http://coders.talend.com   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
