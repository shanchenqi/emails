I think the fact that you avoid connecting to WiFi access points, even ones owned by family members, unless absolutely necessary, may demonstrate that your model of what does and does not constitute a ordinary user behavior might not be the same as other people's. Most people do use WiFi in a variety of places, and most people do charge off of USB ports they have not personally vetted.  Given this, I think fixing bugs that might lead to privilege escalation, even if they require physical connection of USB devices, does indeed seem reasonable.  -- Perry E.
