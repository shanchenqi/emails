This can lead to x87 stack overflow in the execution of subsequent math code, causing it to incorrectly produce a NAN in place of the actual result. If floating point results are used in flow control, this can lead to runaway wrong code execution. For example, in Python (version tested), at least one code path of the dtoa function becomes an infinite loop performing what's effectively an unbounded-length memset when entered under such a condition.  This bug is potentially exploitable in software which calls affected math functions with inputs under user control. Impact depends on how the application handles the ABI-violating x87 state; in Python it seems to be limited to producing a crash.  The bug is present in all versions after up through the current release. Only 32-bit x86 systems (aka IA32, musl's arch) are affected. Users of other archs, including can safely ignore this issue.  Affected users are advised to apply the following patch:    Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
