I don't track CVEs nor care about them at all, and rely on others who depend on those older kernels to provide complex backports as they can test them the best.  Nothing new at all, it's always been that way.  If you know of specific fixes that I have missed, I am glad to accept backports.  Right now we are averaging about 22 patches a day in the latest stable release, and 19 in the latest LTS release.  That's a tiny 5.5% of the number of patches that are being developed and merged upstream, which means that we know we are missing stuff and we rely on people to point out where we have done so.  We take patches from all distros and companies and users where they notice that we have missed things, I would love to take anything that you have noticed that I missed.  thanks!  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
