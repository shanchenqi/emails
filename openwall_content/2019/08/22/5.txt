The issue is that, for example, PCI DSS requires fixes for anything with a score >= 4.0 so we have endless end-users demanding fixes for their servers which don't have even physical access or, indeed, physical presence.  It's not even demanding the fixes as they may already be fixed or simply not applicable because the affected driver isn't present; it's the hours or days wasted verifying that the fix available or not present.[2] > >> > >> > >> > >> Frustrated of Lancashire, jch > >> > >> > >> [1] Some may remember the VAX reset button.  In order to be able to use the serial console (usually a DECwriter) you had to have the key in which also enabled the reset button.   Before I put the VAX "Do Not Copy this Key" key (yes, it fits all I pressed accidentally pressed the reset button a couple of times just by propping myself up on the machine.

Null pointer dereference is a DoS.  Yeah, I don't think those DoS USB bugs are in any way useful to an attacker. I've looked at existing USB CVEs before I've started reporting these, and MITRE does assign CVEs to such issues. I don't know whether they should warrant CVEs or not.  On a side note, currently there's an issue with many Linux kernel bugs being fixed, but not backported to distro kernels. Those bugs might have security implications, but there's no way to know that, unless someone specifically spends time to assess them in that regard. Requesting CVEs for those bugs is a way to get the fixes into distro kernels (even though that doesn't always work promptly [1] :).
