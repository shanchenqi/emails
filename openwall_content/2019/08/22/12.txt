Should we request a CVE for foolish user behaviour? Yes,  USB was designed to make it easy be able to plug/unplug devices without  having to open your device up, but it doesn't mean people should do  stupid things with it. Ok there are different levels of risk, you can  never be totally sure if any device is safe unless you open it up and  start examining. If it is a dumb charger or you know the person who  supplies you with a more sophisticated charging device (either a  manufacturer you trust you bought it from or a friend you trust obtained  the device from a trusted manufacturer) then the risk is lower, but not  eliminated completely.  If I designed a box with PCIe slots on the outside of the case, would  you go around plugging in random circuit boards into it if they were  available at an airport and provided some useful function? I would not.  Whatever interface it is I will only plug it in if I have some  reasonable level of confidence about the device. Or maybe people have  already started reviewing the kernel code looking for ways in which a  malicious PCIe device could own the system.
