FWIW, link [3] seems to be missing some of the USB bugs since it only includes bugs seen on the "ci2-upstream-usb" syzbot manager, when in fact USB bugs are also being reported from the "ci-upstream-kmsan-gce" manager.  Based on my categorization of all open syzbot reports, as of today there are 80 USB-related ones, 52 of which have occurred in the last week.  The 52 are listed at These include use-after-frees, out of bounds reads/writes, using uninitialized memory, general protection faults, etc.  More are reported each week, and syzbot has covered only a tiny percentage of Linux's USB driver code so far.  - Eric  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
