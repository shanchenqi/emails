Would you like to share with the list what happens when an upstream fix doesn't apply cleanly to an earlier kernel?  What happens when a volunteer doesn't show up to backport the fix for you?  If security fixes are being tracked as your "everything is fine, nothing to see here" reply suggests, we wouldn't be carrying hundreds of security fixes your LTS kernels are missing.  You'd also need to explain very easy to find examples like this: of random LTS kernels not receiving security fixes.  This particular issue was public since April (which is when we backported fixes for it to It's now 4 months later and your 4.4 6-year "supported" LTS kernel still doesn't contain the fixes.  This list should be for informing people, not for spreading misinformation and a sense of security that you must know is false.
