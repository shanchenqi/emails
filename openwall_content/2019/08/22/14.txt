Just because something is possible and everyone else  does it doesn't make something less stupid.  It's a similar principle with wifi/bluetooth, which is why I avoid  connecting even to a family member's wifi access point unless it's  absolutely necessary. But USB is a physical interface directly into a  device's circuitry, I think that carries more risk than radio. ok, usb  2.0 is only 2 x power and 2 x data, but radio waves are at least  filtered somewhat after hitting an antenna. Physical interfaces on a  device, on the other hand, the circuit designer does not usually design  them "defensively" (apart from e.g. fuses on the power lines).
