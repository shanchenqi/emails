So those distros that do follow the LTS/stable kernel releases do get these fixes.  Luckily most of the "sane" distros these days do this.  Please don't abuse the CVE process just to try to get a fix backported to a Linux kernel release.  There is at least one company today that does this as it is a way to "route around" management, but really, that shouldn't be needed, fix your management processes instead please :)  thanks,  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
