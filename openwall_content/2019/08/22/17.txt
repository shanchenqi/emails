What would worry me is an exploit where I allow a friend to connect their USB flash drive, it operates normally to all  appearances.  Nothing is auto-executed by a stupid OS (like the Iran centrifuge worm).  But, the device is able to insert some privileged  code through low level protocol bugs - all while operating normally as a USB storage device.  It is not obvious how any of the USB bugs just reported could be exploited that way - but anytime you have buffer overflows and stuff, some evil genius might find a way.  I also worry about file system bugs doing something similar on any removeable media, or downloaded image.  On Thu, 22 Aug Eddie Chapman wrote:  > On Perry E.
