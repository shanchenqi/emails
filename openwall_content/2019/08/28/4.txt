The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * Jenkins weekly * Jenkins LTS * IBM Application Security on Cloud * Splunk Plugin  Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  / Jenkins did not properly escape the update site URL in some status  messages shown in the update center, resulting in a stored cross-site  scripting vulnerability that is exploitable by administrators and affects  other administrators.   / Jenkins allowed the creation of CSRF tokens without a corresponding web  session ID. This is the result of an incomplete fix for in  the security advisory. This allowed attackers able to obtain a  CSRF token without associated session ID to implement CSRF attacks with  the following constraints:  * The token had to be created for the anonymous user (and could only be    used for actions the anonymous user can perform) * The victimâs IP address needed to remain unchanged (unless the proxy    compatibility option was enabled) * The victim must not have a valid web session at the time of the attack   / Splunk Plugin has a form validation HTTP endpoint used to validate a user- submitted Groovy script through compilation, which was not subject to  sandbox protection. This allowed attackers with Overall/Read access to  execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins master by applying AST transforming  annotations such as @Grab to source code elements.   / IBM Application Security on Cloud Plugin stores service passwords in job configurations.  While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in  plain text as part of the configuration form. This could result in  exposure of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting  vulnerabilities, and similar situations.
