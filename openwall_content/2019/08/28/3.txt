Please find patches attached for dovecot and pigeonhole  ---  Open-Xchange Security Advisory   Product: Dovecot Vendor: OX Software GmbH   Internal reference: Vulnerability type: Improper input validation (CWE-20) Vulnerable version: All versions prior to and Vulnerable component: IMAP and ManageSieve protocol parsers (before and after login) Report confidence: Confirmed Solution status: Fixed by Vendor Fixed version: Researcher credits: Nick Roessler and Rafi Rubin, University of Pennsylvania Vendor notification: Solution date: Public disclosure: CVE reference: CVSS: 8.1 (CVSS3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)   Vulnerability Details:  IMAP and ManageSieve protocol parsers do not properly handle NUL byte when scanning data in quoted strings, leading to out of bounds heap memory writes.  Risk:  This vulnerability allows for out-of-bounds writes to objects stored on the heap up to bytes in pre-login phase, and bytes post-login phase, allowing sufficiently skilled attacker to perform complicated attacks that can lead to leaking private information or remote code execution. Abuse of this bug is very difficult to observe, as it does not necessarily cause a crash. Attempts to abuse this bug are not directly evident from logs.  Steps to reproduce:  This bug is best observed using valgrind to see the out of bounds read with following snippet:  perl -e 'print "a id (\"foo\" \"bar\" | nc localhost   Solution:  Operators should update to the latest Patch Release. There is no workaround for the issue.  ---  Aki Tuomi  Open-Xchange oy     View attachment of type "text/x-patch" bytes)  View attachment of type "text/x-patch" bytes)  View attachment of type "text/x-patch" bytes)  View attachment of type "text/x-patch" bytes)  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
