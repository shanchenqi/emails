The debug mode of the DIH admin screen uses this to allow convenient debugging / development of a DIH config. Since a DIH config can contain scripts, this parameter is a security risk. Starting with version of Solr, use of this parameter requires setting the Java System property "enable.dih.dataConfigParam" to true.  Mitigations: * Upgrade to or later, which is secure by default. * or, edit solrconfig.xml to configure all DataImportHandler usages with an "invariants" section listing the "dataConfig" parameter set to am empty string. * Ensure your network settings are configured so that only trusted traffic communicates with Solr, especially to the DIH request handler.  This is a best practice to all of Solr.
