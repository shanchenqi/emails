Maybe "Microsoft Linux Systems Group"? Thats our group name within Microsoft. I guess that we can also add a short wiki page with references to the products/distros we support as well as a clarification that this has nothing to do with Windows and list MSRC's contact information.  >Regardless, the list policy only allows use of the information for >"getting the issue fixed for your distro's users and, only in rare >extreme cases, for deployment of maximally non-revealing changes to >maintain security of your distro's infrastructure most essential to the >distro users' security in face of the security issue being dealt with. >The need-to-know condition is met only if the person needs to >participate in one of these two activities."

As I've indicated before, we intend to follow the list's policies. Information obtained from the list will be used only for the purposes listed in our original application, and any additional future use will go through the list for approvals first.  -- Thanks, Sasha  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
