Copy-paste from the above URL:  --- Georgi Guninski's blog  Sat Jul 6 EEST On Microsoft request to access private linux bugs  According to theregister [1] m$ wants to access private linux bugs. Theregister mentions that in she called linux "cancer". Another example of anti-opensource behavior are the Halloween documents [2] from (some current decision makers and journos have not be born then. History is written by the winners).  It is well known that microsoft is entirely money driven and she will sell Gates' first born and Ballmer might even deliver it.  First, a hostile kernel contributor is danger for the future of linux kernel IMHO.  Unpopular suggestion for microsoft's request for private bugs: Find something that requires windows compatibility (say Wine, some cloud shit, whatever else). Tell microsoft: You want our bugs? We want your bugs. You show first.
