There are probably better ways to do this.  Adding the proper people to the cc, and quoting Tavis' email in its entirety.  Daniel - you got added despite not being explicitly listed as maintainer because you've touched fbdev/core/ more than most lately, plus you know edid anyway. As such: "tag, you're it, sucker".
