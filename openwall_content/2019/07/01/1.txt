I missed the twitter poll but from my perspective as someone involved in  making and releasing such updates for SUSE customers Monday disclosures  tend to work for us but only due to timezones, generally disclosure  times happen into the late afternoon evening, which means that if  lengthy QA tests were left running over the weekend our QA team will  have time to review the results during Monday and we will be ready to  release. I am guessing that some other distro's wouldn't end up with  this luxury. Having said that it will often depend on the amount of  total time we have and the size of the test suite, having said that many  of our automated tests will finish over night.  I guess for distro's who employ people to fix security issues, a Monday  morning / lunch time disclosure is mostly going to mean that everyone  will aim to have update's ready on the Friday night if possible which  doesn't really help with keeping embargo times as short as practical. On  the other hand it might give people patching issues in there spare time  more of a chance.  --   Simon Lees (Simotek)                            http://simotek.net  Emergency Update Team                           keybase.io/simotek SUSE Linux                           Adelaide Australia, GPG Fingerprint: DB9D 88DC CEC5  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
