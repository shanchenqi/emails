The cookie data is then used in an SQL statement. This  allows for an SQL injection attack. Access to this portion of a VCL system  requires admin level rights.  Other layers of security seem to protect against  malicious attack. However, all VCL systems running versions earlier than  should be upgraded or patched.    Mitigation: Upgrade to or apply patches from https://vcl.apache.org/ security.html   Credit: This vulnerability was found and reported to the Apache VCL project by  ADLab of Venustech.
