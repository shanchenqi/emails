The form data is then used  as an argument to the php built in function strtotime. This allows for an  attack against the underlying implementation of that function. The  implementation of strtotime at the time the issue was discovered appeared to  be resistant to a malicious attack. However, all VCL systems running versions  earlier than should be upgraded or patched.  Mitigation: Upgrade to or apply patches from https://vcl.apache.org/ security.html  Credit: This vulnerability was found and reported to the Apache VCL project by  ADLab of Venustech.
