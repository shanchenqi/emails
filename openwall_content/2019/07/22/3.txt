You may plan your availability and schedule an update of the Exim packages supplied by your distribution or build the new release from the source, once the release goes public on CRD.  Details =======  We discovered a vulnerability. We consider the risk of an exploit as low, you need to have a fairly unusual runtime configuration. Neither our default runtime configuration nor the runtime configuration shipped by the Debian distribution is vulnerable.  The vulnerability is exploitable either remotely or locally and could be used to execute other programs with root privilege.  More details and fixes are not yet public, but will be made public on CRD, July 25th.
