Perhaps the wording could be improved to explicitly mention that the private repo mentioned earlier is specifically redacted from this more public pre-release announcement, and/or repeating the fact that the public repo will not contain the fix until CRD (some readers will miss details that are presented only in a headline but not reiterated in the body, on the grounds that headlines typically only summarize contents rather than add details, such that you can read slightly faster by skipping headlines if you are going to read the full version instead).  >> >> The tagged commit is the officially released version.

The old branch is being functionally >> replaced by the new branch.  Or even the choice of tense in this paragraph may help: it sounds like past tense ("is the officially released version") even though at the time of the email it is a future tense ("will become the officially released version").  --  Eric Blake, Principal Software Engineer Red Hat, Inc.
