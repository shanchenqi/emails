This Exim message looks just like any other full-detail disclosure report. It takes time to read the text and clicking through to the repository links to realize that this is not actually leaking code changes and detail about the issue.   The OpenSSL is just a warning that a new version X is about to land.  People who care are left to do their own research into where to get it. The distro teams who need the warning already know that.
