Exactly.  It's just an unusual disclosure process that involves giving the users a heads-up a few days before public disclosure of the actual vulnerabilities and fixes.  So far, this process is practiced by OpenSSL and Exim (any others?)  Unfortunately, this keeps confusing people, which is why this time Heiko's message starts with "Note: EMBARGO is still in effect".  Judging by Mikhail's reply, this wasn't good enough to avoid confusion, and I don't know what would be - maybe a paragraph of text acknowledging that the disclosure process is unusual?  Somehow I didn't notice such confusion in response to OpenSSL's pre-announcements (not here, but on their own announce list), so maybe Exim should try to reuse OpenSSL's wording.  Here's an example:   --- Subject: Forthcoming OpenSSL Releases Date: Tue, 19 Feb  The OpenSSL project team would like to announce the forthcoming release of OpenSSL versions and There will be no new release at this time.  These releases will be made available on 26th February between approximately UTC.  OpenSSL is a security-fix release. The highest severity issue fixed in this release is MODERATE: https://www.openssl.org/policies/secpolicy.html#moderate  OpenSSL is a bug-fix release.
