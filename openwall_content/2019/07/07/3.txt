I don't view it as a present, but as us being reasonable.  The rules don't require the 1 year track record to be for Linux specifically:  "Have a publicly verifiable track record, dating back at least 1 year and continuing to present day, of fixing security issues (including some that had been handled on (linux-)distros, meaning that membership would have been relevant to you) and releasing the fixes within 10 days (and preferably much less than that) of the issues being made public (if it takes you ages to fix an issue, your users wouldn't substantially benefit from the additional time, often around 7 days and sometimes up to 14 days, that list membership could give you)"  I think both the wording and the goal of us having this requirement have been met by Microsoft.  Sure we can wait 1 more month, but what for?  As I understand, your reason would be to hurt Microsoft a tiny bit out of spite for their past actions.  That's not a valid reason.  A reason I consider valid has to do with what entity is to join the linux-distros list.  If it's not Microsoft at large, but "Microsoft Linux Systems Group" as it has just been suggested, then the wording above would apply to that group, and we probably do need to wait 1 more month in order not to set a precedent where some other company's distro could also join with less than 1 year of track record of fixes for the distro.  While I have no doubt the goal of the requirement has already been met by Microsoft, we could be in a less obvious situation with some other company.  So I suggest we subscribe "Microsoft Linux Systems Group" on August 8.  > What mailing list is best to discuss microsoft's involvement in > GPL? (last time I checked LKLM was extremely high traffic)  I don't know.  Certainly not a list we host.
