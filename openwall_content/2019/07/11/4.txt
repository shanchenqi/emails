The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * Docker Plugin * Embeddable Build Status Plugin * Gogs Plugin * Mashup Portlets Plugin  Additionally, we announce unresolved security issues in the following plugins:  * Caliper CI Plugin * Dependency Graph Viewer Plugin * Port Allocator Plugin  Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---    / (CSRF), (permission check) Docker Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing  form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to  connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials  IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.  Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests,  resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.   / Docker Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users  configuring the plugin to select the one to use.  This functionality did not correctly check permissions, allowing any user  with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those  could be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another  vulnerability.   / Embeddable Build Status Plugin did not sanitize arguments provided in the  query string, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability.   / Mashup Portlets Plugin stored SonarQube credentials unencrypted on the  Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed by users with access to  the master file system.   / Gogs Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in job config.xml files on the  Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed by users with Extended  Read permission, or access to the master file system.   / Dependency Graph Viewer Plugin does not correctly escape the Display Name  value for jobs in Jenkins, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting  vulnerability.   / Port Allocator Plugin stores credentials unencrypted in job config.xml  files on the Jenkins master. These credentials can be viewed by users with  Extended Read permission, or access to the master file system.   / Caliper CI Plugin stores credentials unencrypted in job config.xml files on  the Jenkins master. These credentials can be viewed by users with Extended  Read permission, or access to the master file system.
