(http://jk.ozlabs.org/projects/patchwork/)  Andrew Donnellan discovered an XSS via the message-id field. A malicious party could send a patch with a message ID that included a script tag. Because of the quirks of the email RFCs, such a message ID can survive being sent through many mail systems, including Gmail, and be parsed and stored by Patchwork. When a user views a patch detail page for the patch with this message id, the script would be run.  This is due to an erroneous mark_safe() in the template tag that renders message IDs. This has been present since v1.1 of upstream Patchwork, but does not affect the FreeDesktop fork.  Over the last few days, we have disclosed this bug to the admins of patchwork instances that we could identify. Several key instances have already been patched.  The vulnerability is fixed in Patchwork and which have just been released.  Kind regards, Daniel Axtens Patchwork maintainer  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
