Just as young people today have forgotten the "crimes" (not necessarily illegal, but widely regarded at unethical) of Microsoft in the past, so most of the management responsible for those crimes at Microsoft have moved on, and the company is changing.  On the same lines, do you believe Google continues to faithfully follow its founding mandate of "Don't be Evil"?  The only thing you can count on staying the same is the profit motive, it is required by law for a publicly owned corporation.  But profit can be pursued ethically - or not.  --   	      Stuart D.
