Users running public servers with the above configuration are highly encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible, as there are no known mitigations. All versions from and upwards are affected.  Thank you Fang-Pen Lin for finding the issue and reporting it!  The following upstream releases fixes the issue and will be shortly available:   Individual backported patches can be found on the upstream bug tracker, and have been sent separately to the security teams of various distributions:   The programs to reproduce the issue will be shared on the 15th of July.  --  Kind regards, Luca Boccassi  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
