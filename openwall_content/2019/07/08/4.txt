I'll cross-post > LKML/ksummit-discuss/oss-security  Please just take this to LKML, without CC to oss-security.  We can summarize the changes for oss-security separately.  I don't know about relevance to ksummit-discuss.  > as I think it's one of those times it actually makes sense.  This might or might not be an exception, but in general CC'ing a thread to LKML and oss-security is problematic and is specifically discouraged in oss-security content guidelines:  https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security#list-content-guidelines  "Please don't cross-post messages to oss-security and other mailing lists at once, especially not to high-volume lists such as LKML and netdev, as this tends to result in threads that wander partially or fully off-topic (e.g., Linux kernel coding style detail may end up being discussed in comments to a patch posted to LKML, but it would be off-topic for oss-security).  If you feel that something needs to be posted to oss-security and to another list, please make separate postings.  You may mention the other posting(s) in your oss-security posting, and even link to other lists' archives."  > >More importantly, maybe we shouldn't list "Microsoft" as a member of > >linux-distros.

I think listing "Microsoft Linux Systems Group" is enough to avoid the confusion.  I support Moritz's request for you to add to our existing wiki pages with vendors' security contact information, and you can list the pertaining products/distros nearby.
