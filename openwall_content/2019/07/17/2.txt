The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * Jenkins weekly * Jenkins LTS  Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  / Users with Job/Configure permission could specify a relative path escaping the base directory in the file name portion of a file parameter definition.  This path would be used to store the uploaded file on the Jenkins master, resulting in an arbitrary file write vulnerability.   / By default, CSRF tokens in Jenkins only checked user authentication and IP address.  This allowed attackers able to obtain a CSRF token for another user to implement CSRF attacks as long as the victim's IP address remained unchanged.   / Jenkins uses the Stapler web framework to render its UI views.  These views are frequently comprised of several view fragments, enabling plugins to extend existing views with more content.  In some cases attackers could directly access a view fragment containing sensitive information, bypassing any permission checks in the corresponding view.
