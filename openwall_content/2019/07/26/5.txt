CVE ID:     OVE ID:     Date:       Credits:    Jeremy Harris Version(s): up to and including Issue:      A local or remote attacker can execute programs with root             privileges - if you've an unusual configuration. For details             see below.    Coordinated Release Date (CRD) for Exim             Thu Jul 25 UTC    Contact:    security@???    Details: A vulnerability was discovered in the "sort" expansion operator: The elements of the list were expanded, giving a possible attack if the list included data supplied by an attacker.  If the effective configuration file for exim does not use sort then the system is trivially declarable as not being vulnerable. Use this command to check: "exim -bP config | grep sort".  - --  Cheers, Jeremy ---  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
