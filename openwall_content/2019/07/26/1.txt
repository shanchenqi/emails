If public disclosure is deemed too dangerous before a patch is available, this looks like The reasonable tradeoff. Wish it was the same with Linux...  Rationale: people could switch meanwhile to a known safe kernel. That would provide peace of mind to the "rest of us" who don't have the keys to the linux-distros kingdom of the elected few, yet wish to have secure OSes, without a window of vulnerability open to whoever hacked into the elected few's machines (or are entitled another way to this secret information). It would also make Linux governance way more democratic, which seems to be a must for such a "too big to fail" core open-source software.
