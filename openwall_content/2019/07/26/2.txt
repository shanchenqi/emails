The "best known safe kernel" is the latest one we release from the stable kernel series.  It has all of the fixes that that the kernel developers possibly know about at that point in time.  There's no need to worry about being on linux-distros or anything else, just keep updating your kernel, test in in your infrastructure to ensure it all works properly, and then push it out to all of your other systems and all is good.  thanks,  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
