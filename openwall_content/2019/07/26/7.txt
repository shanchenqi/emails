Fixed :)  Thanks!  There's also Apache httpd which was first posted to oss-security and then (wrongly) brought to distros.  You list it with negative embargo period of days, which technically makes sense, but it probably skews the averages, which are meant to be for actual embargoes.  Even if we set it to zero, it'd continue to skew the averages.  So we should probably consistently exclude non-positive embargo periods from the calculation of averages.  Will you, please?  This brings up and leaves open the question of what to do with very short embargo periods like a few hours.  My suggestion is that we continue to include them in the averages, but also add calculation and reporting of median embargo times (also excluding just the non-positive embargo periods from the calculation of the medians).  Can you do it, please?  The non-positive embargo periods should probably continue to be listed in the detail table, but a (foot)note should be added explaining that they're excluded from the calculations.
