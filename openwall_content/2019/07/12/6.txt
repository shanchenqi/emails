It occurs to me that people without a background in computer security might not know what a capability actually is, or how a capability based security system manages access control.  This Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security isn't the best, but it does have good pointers to real explanations.  For a look at how you can implement a capability system on top of Unix, see Capsicum, which was built for FreeBSD but never actually ported to Linux (which is sad and should be corrected):  Note that a primitive form of capabilities can be achieved in the current Linux kernel by passing file descriptors between processes, a tool relatively few people seem to know exists. Given that the "correct" mechanism (something like Capsicum) doesn't exist in Linux yet, it's a poor man's second best. Again, porting Capsicum would be the smart thing to do instead of all this ad hoc stuff.   Perry --  Perry E.
