The whole point is that instead of having the operating system alone as part of your file security implementation you now have a brand new service, an IPC mechanism, and loads of other stuff, instead of having your app just do open(2) and write(2) etc.  It seems architecturally bad from a security perspective. The number the number of trusted entities, the number of moving parts, the number of mechanisms, and thus the number of ways things can go wrong keeps going up. This is a mistake. And btw, this is a major piece of mechanism being added just to handle the problem of someone wanting to pop open an editor inside a GUI to edit a system config file, which is not a major attack vector. But, now I have to worry about this new file access service providing an attack surface that didn't exist before.  What's the right way to handle this stuff? Capabilities, probably. It's what they're designed for.  Perry --  Perry E.
