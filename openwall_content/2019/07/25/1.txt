The Linux kernel must have any of following config options enabled:  CONFIG_BT_HCIUART_MRVL (easy to hit) CONFIG_BT_HCIUART_QCA (hard to hit) CONFIG_BT_HCIUART_BCM CONFIG_BT_HCIUART_INTEL CONFIG_BT_HCIUART_ATH3K  The suggested fix is posted at:   The bug and the reproducer are public, as they were found by the syzcaller several months ago:   was assigned to this bug.  $ id $ uname -r $ ./hci-proto-crash 11 proto = 11 ioctl(SET_HCI_UART_PROTO): Success [   BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: [   #PF: supervisor instruction fetch in kernel mode [   #PF: - not-present page [   PGD 0 P4D 0 [   Oops: [#1] SMP [   CPU: 2 PID: Comm: Not tainted #23 [   Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC + PIIX, [   Workqueue: hci0 hci_power_on [   RIP: [   Code: Bad RIP value.
