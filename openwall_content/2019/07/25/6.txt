Also, some of the dates are wrong (e.g., the date of Exim's pre-announcement to oss-security is irrelevant).  Please combine this into one entry and update the dates.  I guess the range of dates should be from (initial notification to distros) to (full publication).  Correcting this will probably affect the averages.
