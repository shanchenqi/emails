The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * HTML Publisher Plugin * Script Security Plugin  Additionally, we announce unresolved security issues in the following plugins:  * Dingding[钉钉] Plugin * LDAP Email * SourceGear Vault  Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  / Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin could be circumvented through default parameter expressions in constructors.  This allowed attackers able to specify and run sandboxed scripts to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins master JVM.   / HTML Publisher Plugin did not escape the project or build display name shown in the frame HTML page. This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the project or build display name, typically users with Job/Configure or Build/Update permission.   / Dingding[钉钉] Plugin stores an access token unencrypted in job config.xml files on the Jenkins master. This token can be viewed by users with Extended Read permission, or access to the master file system.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / LDAP Email Plugin stores an LDAP bind password in its global Jenkins configuration.  While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form. This can result in exposure of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / SourceGear Vault Plugin stores an SCM password in job configurations.  While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form. This can result in exposure of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
