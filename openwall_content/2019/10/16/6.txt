The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * Bumblebee HP ALM Plugin * Cadence vManager Plugin * CRX Content Package Deployer Plugin 1.9 * Google Kubernetes Engine Plugin * Google OAuth Credentials Plugin * iceScrum Plugin * NeoLoad Plugin  Additionally, we announce unresolved security issues in the following plugins:  * Delphix Plugin * ElasticBox CI Plugin * Extensive Testing Plugin * Fortify on Demand Plugin * Puppet Enterprise Pipeline Plugin * Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute Classic Plugin * Rundeck Plugin * SOASTA CloudTest Plugin * Sofy.AI Plugin * View26 Test-Reporting Plugin  Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---   / Google OAuth Credentials Plugin allowed the creation of credentials based  on the content of files on the Jenkins master through a feature retaining  backwards compatibility with earlier plugin releases.  This allowed users with the permission to configure jobs and credentials to  read arbitrary files on the Jenkins master by creating a credential  referencing an arbitrary file on the Jenkins master.   (1) / (CSRF), (permission check) CRX Content Package Deployer Plugin did not perform permission checks on a  method implementing form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read  access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker- specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing  credentials stored in Jenkins.  Additionally, the form validation method did not require POST requests,  resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.   (2) / CRX Content Package Deployer Plugin provides a list of applicable  credential IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to  use.  This functionality did not correctly check permissions, allowing any user  with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those  could be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another  vulnerability.   / NeoLoad Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in its global configuration  file org.jenkinsci.plugins.neoload.integration.NeoGlobalConfig.xml and in  job config.xml files on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be  viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the master file  system.   / (CSRF), (permission check) iceScrum Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing  form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to  initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server with attacker- specified access token or username and password.  Additionally, the form validation method did not require POST requests,  resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.   / iceScrum Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in job config.xml files on  the Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed by users with  Extended Read permission or access to the master file system.   / Bumblebee HP ALM Plugin unconditionally disabled SSL/TLS certificate  validation for connections to the HP ALM service.   / Missing permission checks in Google Kubernetes Engine Plugin allowed users  with Overall/Read permission to obtain limited information about the scope  and access of a credential with an attacker-specified credential ID  obtained through another method.   / Cadence vManager Plugin unconditionally disabled SSL/TLS certificate  validation for the entire Jenkins master JVM.   / Puppet Enterprise Pipeline Plugin defines a custom whitelist for all  scripts protected by the Script Security sandbox.  This custom whitelist allows the use of methods that can be used to bypass  Script Security sandbox protection. This results in arbitrary code  execution on any Jenkins instance with this plugin installed.  As of publication of this advisory there is no fix.   / Sofy.AI Plugin stores an API token unencrypted in job config.xml files on  the Jenkins master. This token can be viewed by users with Extended Read  permission or access to the master file system.  As of publication of this advisory there is no fix.   / Extensive Testing Plugin stores credentials unencrypted in job config.xml  files on the Jenkins master. These credentials can be viewed by users with  Extended Read permission or access to the master file system.  As of publication of this advisory there is no fix.   / Fortify on Demand Plugin stores credentials unencrypted in job config.xml  files on the Jenkins master. These credentials can be viewed by users with  Extended Read permission or access to the master file system.  As of publication of this advisory there is no fix.   / ElasticBox CI Plugin stores an access token unencrypted in the global config .xml configuration file on the Jenkins master. This token can be viewed by  users with Extended Read permission or access to the master file system.  As of publication of this advisory there is no fix.   / SOASTA CloudTest Plugin stores credentials unencrypted in its global  configuration file com.soasta.jenkins.CloudTestServer.xml on the Jenkins  master. These credentials could be viewed by users with access to the  master file system.  As of publication of this advisory there is no fix.   / View26 Test-Reporting Plugin stores an access token unencrypted in job  config.xml files on the Jenkins master. This token can be viewed by users  with Extended Read permission or access to the master file system.  As of publication of this advisory there is no fix.   / Delphix Plugin stores credentials unencrypted in its global configuration  file io.jenkins.plugins.delphix.GlobalConfiguration.xml on the Jenkins  master. These credentials could be viewed by users with access to the  master file system.  As of publication of this advisory there is no fix.   / (CSRF), (permission check) Rundeck Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method implementing  form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to  initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server with attacker- specified username and password.  Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests,  resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.  As of publication of this advisory there is no fix.   / (CSRF), (permission check) Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute Classic Plugin does not perform  permission checks on a method implementing form validation. This allows  users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to initiate a connection test to  an attacker-specified server with attacker-specified username and password.  Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests,  resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.  As of publication of this advisory there is no fix.
