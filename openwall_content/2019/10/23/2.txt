The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:  * Bitbucket OAuth Plugin * Dynatrace Application Monitoring Plugin * Mattermost Notification Plugin * Zulip Plugin  Additionally, we announce unresolved security issues in the following plugins:  * FireLine Plugin * build-metrics Plugin * Deploy WebLogic Plugin * Dynatrace Application Monitoring Plugin * ElasticBox Jenkins Kubernetes CI/CD Plugin * Global Post Script Plugin * Libvirt Slaves Plugin * Sonar Gerrit Plugin  Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and attribution can be found here:  We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories  If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as described here: https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities  ---  / Mattermost allows the definition of incoming (from the perspective of the service) webhook URLs. These contain what is effectively a secret token as part of the URL.  Mattermost Notification Plugin stored these webhook URLs as part of its global configuration file jenkins.plugins.mattermost.MattermostNotifier.xml and job config.xml files on the Jenkins master. These URLs could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission (in the case of job config.xml files) or access to the master file system.   / Bitbucket OAuth Plugin stored a credential unencrypted in the global config.xml configuration file on the Jenkins master. This credential could be viewed by users with access to the master file system.  Bitbucket OAuth Plugin now stores this credential encrypted.   / Zulip Plugin stored a credential unencrypted in its global configuration file jenkins.plugins.zulip.ZulipNotifier.xml, as well as in the legacy configuration file hudson.plugins.humbug.HumbugNotifier.xml on the Jenkins master. This credential could be viewed by users with access to the master file system.   / Dynatrace Application Monitoring Plugin stored a credential unencrypted in its global configuration file com.dynatrace.jenkins.dashboard.TAGlobalConfiguration.xml on the Jenkins master. This credential could be viewed by users with access to the master file system.   (1) / Dynatrace Application Monitoring Plugin did not require POST requests on a method implementing form validation. This CSRF vulnerability allowed attackers to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server with attacker-specified username and password.   (2) / Dynatrace Application Monitoring Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server with attacker-specified username and password.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / (CSRF), (permission check) Deploy WebLogic Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to send an HTTP HEAD request to a user-specified URL, or confirm the existence of any file or directory on the Jenkins master.  Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / FireLine Plugin accepts XML for part of its configuration. It does not configure the XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.  A form validation method that accepts XML does not perform permission checks. This allows users with Overall/Read permission to have Jenkins parse a crafted XML file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins agent, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / Sonar Gerrit Plugin stores a credential unencrypted in job config.xml files on the Jenkins master if the 'Override Credentials' option is used. This credential can be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the master file system.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   (1) / (CSRF), (permission check) ElasticBox Jenkins Kubernetes CI/CD Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.  Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   (2) / ElasticBox Jenkins Kubernetes CI/CD Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.  This functionality does not correctly check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   (1) / (CSRF), (permission check) Libvirt Slaves Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified SSH server using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.  Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   (2) / Libvirt Slaves Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.  This functionality does not correctly check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / Global Post Script Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read permission to list the files contained in $JENKINS_HOME/global-post-script that can be used by the plugin.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   / build-metrics Plugin does not properly escape the label query parameter, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability.  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
