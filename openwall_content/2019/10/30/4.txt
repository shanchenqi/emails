I also gave others on oss-security time to comment if they wanted to, and we've only seen comments in favor.  Please send me your PGP key off-list and I'll add you to linux-distros.

I'd like you to pick a primary role for some task.  As an option, we can make you primary for "5. Determine if the reported issues are Linux-specific ...", moving SUSE to backup.  Please let me know of your final choice, as well as where you'd like to be primary and where to join as a backup.  We also need a distro to volunteer for the only currently completely unassigned task requiring list membership, Technical 6:  6. Produce and share well-reasoned estimates for the time required to handle the issues under embargo (such as to (re)negotiate the public disclosure date and/or to choose between the different ways to handle an issue)  I mention this not only in response to you, but also in case any other distro would take this opportunity to volunteer for this task.  I guess that same distro could also be involved in Technical 1 and/or 2 since the time estimates and schedules could reasonably come out of such work:  1. Propose (other) ways to fix, work around, or mitigate the reported issues - primary: Red Hat, backup: vacant  2. Develop and share fixes, workarounds, or mitigations - primary: Red Hat, backup: vacant  Any takers?
