As someone who used Android & did my studies on how to secure it and what was missing for that, I can say that Androids still dream of electric blowfishes - or rather ;) - and will do so for a while, especially now that the only part that was open seems is no more. By that virtue, it lost the biggest  advantage it had versus the better polished iOS. And doing that helps red-scarfed black-hats, who can hack into most of the open-source Android variants, which would not be the case if the latter had access to up to date, well-vetted security infos (unlike that late fix that made it even more vulnerable), and that extends to linux-distros by the by. Embargoes are bad. Sure, that made me buy an iPhone, which is good commercially for Apple and I salute their privacy makeup*, but being forced to do so as the collateral victim of a trade war is less cool. *as in definition 6 of the wordreference entry for that word, "A special examination for a student who has been absent ...".  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ Original Message ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ On Friday, October 25, PM, Moritz Mühlenhoff <jmm@...til.org> wrote:  > Android advisories used to contain commit references to AOSP change sets, but > that's not the case for https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/android-10. >   > Typically most of these issues are specific to Android, but there are a few which > per the CVE description are possibly affecting software packaged/used by Linux > distros as well, one example: >   > > "In libvpx, there is a possible out of bounds read due to a missing bounds check. > This could lead to remote information disclosure with no additional execution > privileges needed.
