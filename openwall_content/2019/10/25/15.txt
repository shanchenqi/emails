Hi!  As we keep getting more USB bugs reported by syzbot [1], I'd like to figure out what to do with those in regards to CVEs. Last time I requested a bunch of CVEs for USB bugs, there was a long discussion about whether that is the right thing to do, see the full thread here [2].  I don't want to argue now whether CVEs are useful for the upstream Linux kernel. My question is: with CVEs as they work today, do Linux distros want to see CVEs filed for Linux kernel bugs that are triggerable by a malicious USB device?  Since not all USB bugs are the same, let's bucket them into:  1. Different kinds of DoS (e.g. null-ptr-deref). 2. Info / uninitialized memory leaks. 3. Bugs that lead to arbitrary code execution. 4. Non-triaged memory corruptions (UAF/OOB).  Points 1-3 refer to the bugs that have been assessed for the impact that they cause, while point 4 refers to the bugs that haven't been looked at closely.  Keep in mind that:  1. Most of the time physical access to the USB port is required to trigger these bugs. 2. Sometimes, in cases of e.g. exposed USB/IP or USBAnywhere like vulnerabilities [3] these bugs can be triggered remotely.  Thanks!
