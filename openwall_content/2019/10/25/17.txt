Android advisories used to contain commit references to AOSP change sets, but that's not the case for https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/android-10.  Typically most of these issues are specific to Android, but there are a few which per the CVE description are possibly affecting software packaged/used by Linux distros as well, one example:  "In libvpx, there is a possible out of bounds read due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to remote information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed. "  Similar for (also libexif and opencv)  Is there anyone from Android/Google on the list, who can comment on this? Can these references be added again for the benefit of non-Android distros?
