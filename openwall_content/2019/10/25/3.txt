ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  changes required, among other things, making any PTE updates restartable.  The changes making PTE updates restartable assumed that L2 pagetables would always be promoted preemptibly; but this turns out not to be the case when using the 'linear pagetable' feature; the result was that interrupted operations are not handled properly in certain cases.  Furthermore, previous security work making pagetable update preemptible failed to account for 'linear pagetables' at L3 and L4 levels, making it possible for operations to run for longer than acceptable times.  IMPACT ======  Malicious or buggy x86 PV guest kernels can mount a Denial of Service (DoS) attack affecting the whole system.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen versions are vulnerable.  Only x86 systems are affected.  ARM systems are not affected.  Only Xen versions which permit linear page table use by PV guests are vulnerable.  Only x86 PV guests can leverage this vulnerability.  x86 HVM guests cannot leverage this vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  Not permitting linear page table use by PV guests avoids the vulnerability.  This can be done both at build time, by turning off the PV_LINEAR_PT configure option, or at runtime, by passing specifying "pv-linear-pt=0" on the hypervisor command line.  Doing so would, however, render PV guests using the functionality, like NetBSD, unusable.  On systems where the guest kernel is controlled by the host rather than guest administrator, running only kernels which only issue sane hypercalls will prevent untrusted guest users from exploiting this issue.  However untrusted guest administrators can still trigger it unless further steps are taken to prevent them from loading code into the kernel (e.g by disabling loadable modules etc) or from using other mechanisms which allow them to run code at kernel privilege.  Running only HVM guests will avoid this vulnerability.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Manuel Bouyer.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate pair of attached patches resolves this issue.          xen-unstable             Xen             Xen              Xen 4.9.x              Xen 4.8.x              Xen 4.7.x  $              $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or the HVM-only as well as host controlled kernel mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  HOWEVER deployment of the "pv-linear-pt=0" mitigation described above is NOT permitted (except where all the affected systems and VMs are administered and used only by organisations which are members of the Xen Project Security Issues Predisclosure List).  Specifically, deployment on public cloud systems is NOT permitted.  This is because in that case the configuration change is visible to the guest, which could lead to the rediscovery of the vulnerability.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
