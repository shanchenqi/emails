ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Virtual device backends and device models running in domain 0, or other backend driver domains, need to be able to map guest memory (either via grant mappings, or via the foreign mapping interface).  Inside Xen, mapped grants are tracked by the maptrack structure.  The size of this structure is chosen during domain creation, and has a fixed upper bound for the lifetime of the domain.  For Linux to keep track of these mappings, it needs to have a page structure for each one.  In practice the number of page structures is usually limited.  In PV guests, a range of pfns are typically set aside at boot ("pre-ballooned") for this purpose.  For HVM/PVH and Arm guests, no memory is set aside to begin with.  In either case, when more of this "foreign / grant map pfn space" is needed, Linux will balloon out extra pages to use for this purpose.  Unfortunately, in Linux, there are no limits, either on the total amount of memory which the domain will attempt to balloon out, nor on the amount of "foreign / grant map" memory which any individual guest can consume.  For Linux userspace backends (e.g. QEMU) which use /dev/xen/gnttab or /proc/xen/gnttab, there is an arbitrary mapping limit which, if hit, will prevent further mappings from being established.  As a result, a malicious guest may be able to, with crafted requests, cause a backend Linux domain to either:   1) Fill the maptrack table in Xen and/or hit the userspace limit.     This will starve I/O from other guests served by the same backend.   2) Balloon out sufficient RAM to cause it to swap excessively, or run     completely out of memory.  This may starve all operations from the     domain, including I/O from other guests, or may cause a crash of     the domain.  IMPACT ======  Guest may be able to crash backend Linux domains, or starve operations inside the domain, including the processing of guest I/O requests (Guest Denial-of-Service).  If the backend is domain 0, which is the most common configuration, then host-wide operations may be starved, or the host may crash (Host Denial-of-Service).  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All versions of Linux are vulnerable.  Only Linux guests acting as backend domains for other guests may be exploited.  All Arm domains are vulnerable, as are x86 PVH/HVM guests.  The vulnerability of x86 PV guests depends on how they were configured at boot.  MITIGATION ==========  PV guests can be constructed with "pre-ballooned" memory, by building it with maxmem > memory.  See `man 5 xl.cfg` for full details of these two parameters.  For PV dom0, these are controlled by Xen's "dom0_mem=$X,max:$Y" command line parameter.  The larger the difference between memory and maxmem, the more space Linux has to fill with grant/foreign mappings before it will start ballooning out real memory to satisfy further mapping requests.  This makes the attack more difficult to accomplish.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Julien Grall of ARM.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves the backend memory exhaustion issue.  NOTE: This does NOT fix the guest starvation issue.  Fixing fixing this issue is more complex, and it was determined that it was better to work on a robust fix for the issue in public.  This advisory will be updated when fixes are available.      Linux 4.4 ... 5.2  $  $  NOTE ON LACK OF EMBARGO =======================  The lack of predisclosure is due to a short schedule set by the discoverer, and efforts to resolve the advisory wording. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----  =rVDQ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
