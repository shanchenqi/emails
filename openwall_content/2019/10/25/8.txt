CVE assigned.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  On hardware supporting the fsgsbase feature, 64bit PV guests can set and clear the applicable control bit in its virtualised %cr4, but the feature remains fully active in hardware.  Therefore, the associated instructions are actually usable.  Linux, which does not currently support this feature, has various optimisations in its context switch path which justifiably assume that userspace can't actually make changes without a system call.  Xen's behaviour of having this feature active behind the guest kernel's back undermines the correctness of any context switch logic which depends on the feature being disabled.  Userspace can therefore corrupt fsbase or gsbase (commonly used for Thread Local Storage) in the next thread to be scheduled on the current vcpu.  IMPACT ======  A malicious unprivileged guest userspace process can escalate its privilege to that of other userspace processes in the same guest, and potentially thereby to that of the guest operating system.  Additionally, some guest software which attempts to use this CPU feature may trigger the bug accidentally, leading to crashes or corruption of other processes in the same guest.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen versions 4.4 and later are vulnerable.  Xen 4.3 and earlier are not vulnerable.  Only x86 hardware with the fsgsbase feature is vulnerable.  This is believed to be Intel IvyBridge and later hardware, and AMD Steamroller and later hardware.  ARM hardware is not affected.  Only 64bit PV guests can exploit the vulnerability.  32bit PV guests, and HVM/PVH guests cannot exploit the vulnerability.  Whether the bug is exploitable, and whether it will be triggered by accident, depend in a complicated way on the guest operating system and its configuration.  Most guests are vulnerable to malicious userspace processes.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only 32bit PV or HVM/PVH guests will avoid this vulnerability.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Andy Lutomirski.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patches resolves this issue.          xen-unstable             Xen             Xen              Xen 4.9.x              Xen 4.8.x              Xen 4.7.x  $                $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.   (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
