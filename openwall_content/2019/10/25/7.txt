ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Use of Process Context Identifiers (PCID) was introduced into Xen in order to improve performance after (and in particular its Meltdown sub-issue).  This enablement implied changes to the TLB flushing logic.  One aspect which was overlooked is the safety of switching between shadow pagetables, which previously relied on the unconditional flushing of a write to CR3.  With PCID enabled, a switch of shadow pagetable for a 64bit PV guest fails to invalidate the linear mappings of the previous shadow pagetable.  As a result, subsequent accesses to the shadow pagetables may be deemed to be safe by the shadow logic (based on the old shadow pagetable) but fault when made in practice.  IMPACT ======  Malicious 64bit PV guests may be able to cause a host crash (Denial of Service).  Additionally, vulnerable configurations are unstable even in the absence of an attack.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Only x86 systems are vulnerable.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.  Only systems running 64-bit x86 PV guests are vulnerable.  Systems running only x86 HVM or PVH or 32bit PV guests are not vulnerable.  Only systems with at least one PCID-enabled PV guest are vulnerable.  Systems where PCID or INVPCID are unavailable or entirely disabled are not vulnerable.  Note that PCID is enabled by default for both 64-bit dom0 and 64-bit domU when hardware supports it.  PCID acceleration has been backported to the following versions:  - Xen  - Xen and onwards,  - Xen and onwards,  - Xen and onwards,  - Xen  MITIGATION ==========  Running only HVM or PVH guests will avoid this vulnerability.  Disabling use of PCID entirely, by passing "pcid=0" or "invpcid=0" as a command line option to the hypervisor, will also avoid this vulnerability (albeit re-introducing the XPTI performance regression use of PCID was intended to reduce).  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            xen-unstable               Xen               Xen                Xen 4.9.x                Xen 4.8.x                Xen 4.7.x  $       $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.   (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
