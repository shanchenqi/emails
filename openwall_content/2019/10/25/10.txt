ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  In order for a PV domain to set up DMA from a passed-through device to one of its pages, the page must be mapped in the IOMMU.  On the other hand, before a PV page may be used as a "special" page type (such as a pagetable or descriptor table), it _must not_ be writable in the IOMMU (otherwise a malicious guest could DMA arbitrary page tables into the memory, bypassing Xen's safety checks); and Xen's current rule is to have such pages not in the IOMMU at all.  Until now, in order to accomplish this, the code has borrowed HVM domain's "physmap" concept: When a page is assigned to a guest, guess_physmap_add_entry() is called, which for PV guests, will create a writable IOMMU mapping; and when a page is removed, guest_physmap_remove_entry() is called, which will remove the mapping.  Additionally, when a page gains the PGT_writable page type, the page will be added into the IOMMU; and when the page changes away from a PGT_writable type, the page will be removed from the IOMMU.  Unfortunately, borrowing the "physmap" concept from HVM domains is problematic.  HVM domains have a lock on their p2m tables, ensuring synchronization between modifications to the p2m; and all hypercall parameters must first be translated through the p2m before being used. Trying to mix this locked-and-gated approach with PV's lock-free approach leads to several races and inconsistencies.  IMPACT ======  An untrusted PV domain with access to a physical device can DMA into its own pagetables, leading to privilege escalation.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Only x86 systems are vulnerable.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.  Only systems where PV guests are given direct access to physical devices (PCI pass-through) are vulnerable.  Systems with only HVM guests, or systems which do not use PCI pass-through, are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  Only assigning devices to HVM guests will avoid these vulnerabilities.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Paul Durrant of Citrix.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            xen-unstable      Xen Xen       Xen 4.9.x       Xen 4.8.x       Xen 4.7.x  $       $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.   (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
