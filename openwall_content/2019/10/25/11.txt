IIRC there was kernel verified by the Isabelle prover.  >From experience, I am skeptical about bugs in provers and had false proofs in CBMC and Coq (long ago).  PS: I am looking for remote job. Probably you don't I want to sell out to the communist party of People's Republic of China or the NORKs ;) CV: https://j.ludost.net/resumegg.pdf  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
