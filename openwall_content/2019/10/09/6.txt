We handle security reports for Nix, NixOS, and the Nix ecosystem.  > Bug report: Reported privately to the NixOS security team on  I can confirm we received, validated, and improperly handled this report.  I took lead on this issue and began authoring a patch to fix it. We had a partial fix, and I dropped the ball. I have opened up my partial patch to the greater NixOS security community[1] to get help in finishing this off.  Unfortunately, the problem is in a challenging spot: the code must be authored very carefully to not fail. More unfortunately, the root of this issue has been known for some time[2].  As soon as we are comfortable with a fix, we will release a new version of Nix.  We will also examine how we handle security issues, and publish a post-mortem of how this happened and how our processes will be changed to prevent this from happening again.  Thank you, Michael for bringing this issue to the public eye.
