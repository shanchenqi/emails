In the guest, we use the reproducer patch that you provided for But it doesn't work for us, and it is either crashing the guest or not able to crash the host during the migration. 1. If we ssh to the guest, and run the echo command to trigger the bug. Then the guest kernel crashes, even before the modprobe command is executed. 2. If we use the console to access the guest, then we can run echo/modprobe -r /modprobe commands successfully. But later the live migration is always successful, and the host is not crashed.  So, as described above, we are not able to reproduce the host crash with the provided patch because either the guest crashes with the patch or live migration succeeds when the guest is not crashing. Would it be possible for you to have another look at the patches that you used to reproduce and probably post if the patches that you have differs from the posted one? Thanks a lot!
