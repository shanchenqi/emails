ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  hypercall_create_continuation() is a variadic function which uses a printf-like format string to interpret its parameters.  Error handling for a bad format character was done using BUG(), which crashes Xen.  One path, via the VCPUOP_initialise hypercall, has a bad format character.  The BUG() can be hit if VCPUOP_initialise executes for a sufficiently long period of time for a continuation to be created.  IMPACT ======  Malicious guests may cause a hypervisor crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (Dos).  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen versions 4.6 and newer are vulnerable.  Xen versions 4.5 and earlier are not vulnerable.  Only x86 PV guests can exploit the vulnerability.  HVM and PVH guests, and guests on ARM systems, cannot exploit the vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  There are no mitigations.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Andrew Cooper of Citrix.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            Xen 4.9 ... unstable       Xen 4.7 ... 4.8  $    $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.   (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
