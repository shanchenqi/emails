The patches are broken on ARM (which is not affected by the issue). Don't apply the patches on ARM.  See Resolution.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  When a PCI device is assigned to an untrusted domain, it is possible for that domain to program the device to DMA to an arbitrary address. The IOMMU is used to protect the host from malicious DMA by making sure that the device addresses can only target memory assigned to the guest. However, when the guest domain is torn down, or the device is deassigned, the device is assigned back to dom0, thus allowing any in-flight DMA to potentially target critical host data.  IMPACT ======  An untrusted domain with access to a physical device can DMA into host memory, leading to privilege escalation.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Only systems where guests are given direct access to physical devices capable of DMA (PCI pass-through) are vulnerable.  Systems which do not use PCI pass-through are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  In some configurations, use of passthrough can be replaced with a higher-level protocol such as Xen PV block or network devices.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Paul Durrant of Citrix.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patchset should resolve this issue. For Xen 4.9 and earlier at least the first patch of (whitespace cleanup) is also needed for to apply.  Unfortunately, at the time of writing, these patches have not been tested to our satisfaction.  The patches are known to break on ARM.  ARM is not affected by the issue, so do not apply these patches on ARM systems.  (On x86, there is a latent bug but the patches are good to use.)          xen-unstable    Xen    Xen    Xen     Xen 4.9.x, Xen 4.8.x  $           $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the *patches* described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Also: deployment of the reconfiguration *mitigation* is NOT permitted (except where all the affected systems and VMs are administered and used only by organisations which are members of the Xen Project Security Issues Predisclosure List).  Specifically, deployment on public cloud systems is NOT permitted.  This is because this reconfiguration reveals that a PCI passthrough vulnerability is involved.  Deployment of that migitation is permitted only AFTER the embargo ends.  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
