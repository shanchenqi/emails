ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  p2m->max_mapped_gfn is used by the functions p2m_resolve_translation_fault() and p2m_get_entry() to sanity check guest physical frame.  The rest of the code in the two functions will assume that there is a valid root table and check that with BUG_ON().  The function p2m_get_root_pointer() will ignore the unused top bits of a guest physical frame.  This means that the function p2m_set_entry() will alias the frame.  However, p2m->max_mapped_gfn will be updated using the original frame.  It would be possible to set p2m->max_mapped_gfn high enough to cover a frame that would lead p2m_get_root_pointer() to return NULL in p2m_get_entry() and p2m_resolve_translation_fault().  Additionally, the sanity check on p2m->max_mapped_gfn is off-by-one allowing "highest mapped + 1" to be considered valid.  However, p2m_get_root_pointer() will return NULL.  The problem could be triggered with a specially crafted hypercall XENMEM_add_to_physmap{, _batch} followed by an access to an address (via hypercall or direct access) that passes the sanity check but cause p2m_get_root_pointer() to return NULL.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest administrator may cause a hypervisor crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen version 4.8 and newer are vulnerable.  Only Arm systems are vulnerable.  x86 systems are not affected.  MITIGATION ==========  There are no mitigations.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Julian Grall of Arm.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.   xen-unstable to Xen    Xen to Xen 4.8  $        $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
