Public release.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  When an exception occurs on an ARM system which is handled without changing processor level, some interrupts are unconditionally enabled during exception entry.  So exceptions which occur when interrupts are masked will effectively unmask the interrupts.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest might contrive to arrange for critical Xen code to run with interrupts erroneously enabled.  This could lead to data corruption, denial of service, or possibly even privilege escalation. However a precise attack technique has not been identified.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All ARM systems are vulnerable.  x86 systems are not vulnerable.  On some platforms this issue could possibly be exploited by an unprivileged userspace attacker.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Julian Grall of Arm.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.          xen-unstable .. Xen 4.9     Xen 4.8  $           $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
