ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  When emulating certain PV guest operations, descriptor table accesses are performed by the emulating code.  Such accesses should respect the guest specified limits, unless otherwise guaranteed to fail in such a case.  Without this, emulation of 32-bit guest user mode calls through call gates would allow guest user mode to install and then use descriptors of their choice, as long as the guest kernel did not itself install an LDT.  (Most OSes don't install any LDT by default).  IMPACT ======  32-bit PV guest user mode can elevate its privileges to that of the guest kernel.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen versions from at least 3.2 onwards are affected.  Only 32-bit PV guest user mode can leverage this vulnerability.  HVM, PVH, as well as 64-bit PV guests cannot leverage this vulnerability.  Arm systems are unaffected.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only HVM, PVH, or 64-bit PV guests will avoid this vulnerability.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Andrew Cooper of Citrix.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.            xen-unstable, Xen      Xen      Xen       Xen 4.9.x, Xen 4.8.x, Xen 4.7.x  $      $  DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO =========================  Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.  But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other members of the predisclosure list).  Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  (Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
