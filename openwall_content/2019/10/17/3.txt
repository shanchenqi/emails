Similar to what Michael Orlitzky reported for Nix the profile directory in GNU Guix would be world-writable, allowing a malicious user to populate the profile of a user that has never logged in on the machine.  This issue has been assigned and affects all versions of Guix up to included.  The fix is similar to that written for Nix by Eelco Dolstra (the build daemon of Guix derives from that of Nix). It can be deployed via ‘guix pull’ as specified in the announcement below.  Announcement:  Issue:  Commit:  Ludo’.
