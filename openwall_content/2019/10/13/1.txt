Adding the median is not done at this point to make sure the updated figures are available. It turns out to not be quite as easy as I first projected given LibreOffice doesn't have a median counterpart to [AVERAGEIFS] so I likely need to use some array formula instead, so I'll do that as a separate update when I get around to it.
