The sPAPAR(hw/ppc/spapr.c) emulator  populates the device tree for the guest with two fields "host-serial" and  "host-model". The values for these fields are taken via hypervisor from the  host device tree data exposed in "/proc/device-tree/system-id" and  "/proc/device-tree/model" file respectively.
