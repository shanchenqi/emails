Do you really need sealing?  It's a bit odd to add a new system call dependency in a security update.  The ability fexecve a memfd descriptor is also rather odd.  I wouldn't have expected execute permissions on memfd descriptors, so this sounds like a kernel bug (which now can't be fixed).  I saw some other patch with a O_TMPFILE replacement.  Does this really work?  It's possible to create a new name with linkat, so that's not a real win security-wise.  Could you just make a copy, under a different owner, and not care how it is going to be modified?
