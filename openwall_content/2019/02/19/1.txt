D-Bus is a protocol and dbus is the reference implementation of the D-Bus protocol, so it's really the D-Bus specification.  The limit also comes from the D-Bus Specification, which isn't always as good as it might be about taking a rule from one part of the spec and noting its consequences in another part (patches welcome). The intention is that wherever rules rule1 and rule2 overlap, messages must obey (rule1 && rule2) - so for instance when a string or path can be any 32-bit length, a string or path is part of a message, and a message is up to the practical result is that the longest possible string or path is a bit less than  > From testing on Ubuntu it seems that the > real limit is actually much less than this - dbus-daemon drops the > connection when I try to send a message with an object path greater than > about 32MB.  This lower limit is `dbus-daemon --system` policy/configuration to mitigate/limit denial-of-service attacks by resource exhaustion (and accidentally also mitigation for attacks like this one, although I don't think that was ever intentional) - part of dbus, the reference implementation of D-Bus, rather than part of the D-Bus spec. It can differ in other implementations like dbus-broker and gdbus-daemon, and it can also be changed by distros or sysadmins.      smcv  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
