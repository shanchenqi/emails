A local attacker with permission to execute i2c commands could exploit this to read stack memory of the qemu process on the host.  This was fixed upstream in commit  Systems without a monitor connected are affected, as are virtual monitor is presented to virtual guests.  Systems with no graphics cards attached to the virtual host are not affected.  This seems to be an information leak of stack contents which can be used to defeat some kernel level protections and simplify further attacks.
