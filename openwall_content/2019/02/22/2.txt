This is because, on further analysis, we have determined that the advisory was issued in error: there is no security issue.  UPDATES IN VERSION 2 ====================  Advisory withdrawn.  DESCRIPTION ===========  stated:          VT-d: Incorrect accesses into the Interrupt Remapping table     A VT-d IOMMU has several tables in main RAM, which are configured by the    driver when it starts.  The tables are required to be aligned on a 4k    boundary, and the control registers in the IOMMU which point to them use    the bottom 12 bits for additional metadata.     Unfortunately, Xen's VT-d driver includes this metadata in its base    pointer to the table, resulting in incorrect calculations when indexing    into the table.  Upon closer inspection, due to the particular way the calculations are implemented, the "metadata" components end up being eliminated without affecting the final result.  IMPLICATIONS ============  does not describe any security or functional issue.  The previously declared embargo for is vacated. Anyone who has information relating to may publish it.  NB: there are other advisories are with the same embargo date. Those advisories stand, and their embargoes REMAIN IN FORCE.  STATUS OF THE PATCHES =====================  The patch previously published under embargo in is not necessary.  However, it is harmless; indeed it improves code clarity and is likely to be included in future Xen releases in some form.  In the interests of transparency, the patch is attached:  $  $  There is no need to apply this patch. If you have already applied it, there is no need to revert it.  CREDITS =======  Thanks to Pawel Wieczorkiewicz and Uwe Dannowski, both of Amazon, for pointing out that there was no actual security issue. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----  =+3TC -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Download attachment of type "application/octet-stream" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
