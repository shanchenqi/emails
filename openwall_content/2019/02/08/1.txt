The vulnerability was introduced in There was a partial fix applied in [1], but that fix still leaked partial keys.  At the time of this writing, a fix is proposed at [2].  There is not yet a released version of Pagure with a fix, but Pagure administrators can work around this issue by disabling the cron job. It may be wise to delete all API tokens that may have been e-mailed after disabling the cron job as a precautionary measure.
