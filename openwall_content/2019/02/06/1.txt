The function handling incoming NTLM type-2 messages (`lib/vauth/ntlm.c:ntlm_decode_type2_target`) does not validate incoming data correctly and is subject to an integer overflow vulnerability.  Using that overflow, a malicious or broken NTLM server could trick libcurl to accept a bad length + offset combination that would lead to a buffer read out-of-bounds.  We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.  INFO ----  This bug was introduced in [commit January  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name to this issue.  Out-of-bounds Read  Severity: 5.3 (Medium)  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  - Affected versions: libcurl to and including - Not affected versions: libcurl < and >=  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such.  THE SOLUTION ------------  A [patch for  RECOMMENDATIONS ---------------  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:    A - Upgrade curl to version    B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild    C - Turn off NTLM authentication  TIME LINE ---------  It was reported to the curl project on December 30, We contacted distros@...nwall on January 28.  curl was released on February 6 coordinated with the publication of this advisory.
