The function creating an outgoing NTLM type-3 header (`lib/vauth/ntlm.c:Curl_auth_create_ntlm_type3_message()`), generates the request HTTP header contents based on previously received data. The check that exists to prevent the local buffer from getting overflowed is implemented wrongly (using unsigned math) and as such it does not prevent the overflow from happening.  This output data can grow larger than the local buffer if very large "nt response" data is extracted from a previous NTLMv2 header provided by the malicious or broken HTTP server.  Such a "large value" needs to be around bytes or more. The actual payload data copied to the target buffer comes from the NTLMv2 type-2 response header.  We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.  INFO ----  This bug was introduced in [commit January  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name to this issue.  Stack-based Buffer Overflow  Severity: 7.3 (High)  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  - Affected versions: libcurl to and including - Not affected versions: libcurl < and >=  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such.  THE SOLUTION ------------  A [patch for  RECOMMENDATIONS ---------------  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:    A - Upgrade curl to version    B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild    C - Turn off NTLM authentication  TIME LINE ---------  It was reported to the curl project on December 30, We contacted distros@...nwall on January 28.  curl was released on February 6 coordinated with the publication of this advisory.  CREDITS -------  Reported by Wenxiang Qian of Tencent Blade Team. Patch by Daniel Stenberg.
