Even though you had a disclaimer I feel I want to give a short answer. That quote probably comes from a page that I removed a while ago and now says " I'm no longer maintaining this list, as it was extremely outdated."  It's at least 3 years old and back then we were in a state where you could pick a random command line tool, run afl+asan against it and crashes would fall out within seconds. My intent back then was to establish some baseline robustness, so take my words there as "it's not that easy any more to find bugs in IM/GM within very short timeframes and very simple methods". Which I guess is still true and not in contradiction that with more involved methods you'll find more.   These days my remaining worries about fuzzing-related bugs are primarily targets that don't fit into the libfuzzer/oss-fuzz framework, e.g. networking-software that has no easy way to abstract their parser code into a function call.  --  Hanno Bรถck https://hboeck.de/  mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
