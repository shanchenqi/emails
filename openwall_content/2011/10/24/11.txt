Indeed, the text on the CVE page is entirely bogus.  I'd recommend using this text, from our advisory: > When a UNIX-domain socket is attached to a location using the bind(2) > system call, the length of the provided path is not validated.

The places where the FreeBSD advisory mentions linux emulation relate only to the non-security bugfix which we rolled into the patch for the sake of avoiding breakage.  (Is there anyone on the list who can fix the CVE description?  If not, I'll poke the CVE folks directly.)  --  Colin Percival Security Officer, FreeBSD | freebsd.org | The power to serve Founder / author, Tarsnap | tarsnap.com | Online backups for the truly paranoid  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
