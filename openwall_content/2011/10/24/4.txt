When that configuration file was loaded from remote WebDAV  or Samba CIFS share, it could lead to arbitrary security module load, potentially leading to execution of arbitrary code (execution of code from untrusted security module).  Upstream bug report: [1]  Other references: [2] [3] [4] [5]  Could you allocate a CVE id for this? (as it looks there isn't one for this deficiency yet)  Thank you && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
