Facts:  - Affect all Piwik users that have let granted some access to the "anonymous" user - Remotely exploitable vulnerability that could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code - Versions affected Piwik 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4 - Credits: Neal Poole  These details should be enough information for CVE assignment. I can also verify this issue if you want for every version? If there isn't enough details I can dig more :)  Best regards, Henri Salo  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
