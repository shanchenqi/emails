Besides the strcpy() and strcat() with obviously known target buffer size, there are also:            strcpy (stpcpy (nambuf2, n2), ".$$$___cleanit___$$$");  and:        strcpy (p, di->d_name);  where "p" points somewhere inside nambuf1.  These will just need different reproducers.  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
