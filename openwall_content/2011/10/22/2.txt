Actually, I think my proposed reproducer (many nested dirs) triggers this one and not the strcat().  On one build, hardlink then crashes after dereferencing the "dirs" pointer, which happens to be overwritten with a directory name.  On another build (different gcc version and arch), hardlink does not crash (although I think it would on even more nested directories), but reports a ridiculous directory count (so "ndirs" is overwritten).  -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 didn't make a difference here (different program binary, same observed behavior).
