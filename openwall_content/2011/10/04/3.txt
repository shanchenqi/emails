Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> CC: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: being duplicate of  Hello Steve, Josh,     originally the CVE identifier of has been assigned:    [1]  has been assigned to the following flaw: [2] [3] https://www.htbridge.ch/advisory/xss_in_zikula.html  Later has been assigned:  Name: Status: Candidate URL: [Open URL] Final-Decision: Interim-Decision: Modified: Proposed: Assigned: Category: Reference: XSS in Zikula Reference:   [Open URL] Reference: MISC:https://www.htbridge.ch/advisory/xss_in_zikula.html  [Open URL] Reference:   [Open URL] Reference: Reference: [Open URL] Reference: Reference: [Open URL] Reference: Reference: [Open URL] Reference: Reference: [Open URL]  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in ztemp/view_compiled/Theme/theme_admin_setasdefault.php in the theme module in Zikula Application Framework build and probably other versions allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the themename parameter in the setasdefault action to index.php.  The security focus link URL in the second assignment is slightly different, but the content of that post seems to be the same.  suggests there are three ways / attack vectors, how to exploit this: a) via specially-crafted 'themename' parameter in 'setasdefault.php'     script, b) via specially-crafted 'themename' parameter in modify theme script     and, c) via specially-crafted 'themename' parameter in delete theme script.  So since description explicitly mentions 'set as default', should this identifier be considered to refer only to 'set as default' case (a) in the above) or are the and just CVE duplicates for the same issue?  If the latter holds, which is the correct one (assuming the higher one is valid, thus to use for issue referencing purposes?
