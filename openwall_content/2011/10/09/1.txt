The issue exists in the fact that admin.php may possibly include PHP files not used for the UseBB admin control panel (ACP).  The faulty code in question is only executed for logged in administrator accounts, and can only include non-relevant PHP files if a directory "sources/admin_" exists, which is not the case in UseBB 1. Therefore, the issue does not pose a direct threat to an existing UseBB set-up, but is classified a security issue anyway and has been fixed in UseBB  Vulnerability Multiple CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) in UseBB"  High-Tech Bridge SA also discovered possibilities of executing CSRF attacks in UseBB and earlier. This way, when a user is given a malicious URL or visits a web page containing such URL or JavaScript, requests may be executed that add, edit or delete data on the forum, including topics, posts, account information and settings in the ACP (if the user has logged in into the ACP).  As a solution, UseBB has implemented URL and form tokens for sensitive actions. Accessing or executing above URLs or scripts now doesn't have an effect on the data.   --  Hanno Bรถck		mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
