OVERVIEW  Joomla! (stable version) is vulnerable to multiple Cross Site Scripting issues.   2. BACKGROUND  Joomla is a free and open source content management system (CMS) for publishing content on the World Wide Web and intranets. It comprises a modelâviewâcontroller (MVC) Web application framework that can also be used independently. Joomla is written in PHP, uses object-oriented programming (OOP) techniques and software design patterns, stores data in a MySQL database, and includes features such as page caching, RSS feeds, printable versions of pages, news flashes, blogs, polls, search, and support for language internationalization.   3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION  Several parameters (searchword, extension, asset, author ) in Joomla! Core components are not properly sanitized upon submission to the /index.php url, which allows attacker to conduct Cross Site Scripting attack. This may allow an attacker to create a specially crafted URL that would execute arbitrary script code in a victim's browser.   4. VERSION AFFECTED  <=   5.
