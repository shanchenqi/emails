Petr Lautrbach (Cc-ed) commented on Red Hat Bugzilla bug [1], that:  <quote>  > URL redirection abuse:  >  >   awredir.pl is url redirector so this is its main/only feature and it is/can be secured by $KEYFORMD5. So I don't think this is flaw. </quote>  Thus explicitly mentioning it here too, so this would not fall out of the radar and just five CVE ids would be assigned.  Thank you && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team  P.S.: Petr, if you have more comments on the rest of the issues,        feel free to do so in order to proper set of CVE ids would        be assigned to these.
