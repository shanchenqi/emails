You asked about 6 CVE for holes, but there are 7 holes (with two variations  for holes #2 and #3), which I disclosed (but it's possible to make one CVE  entry for #4 with two XSS holes). Here is few moments concerning your asking  about CVE.  1. The holes #1 and #2 was already disclosed earlier, as I stated in my advisory. I just remind about them for fullness of my advisory and to show differences between versions of AWStats (that protecting parameter key was added in version 1.2) and that this parameter can be bypassed. As I show in examples for holes #2, #3, #5 and #6.  2. As I stated in my advisory, as I tested, for hole #1 (XSS) was vulnerable version 1.1 build 1.6, but was not vulnerable 1.1 build 1.5 (which shipped with AWStats 6.0 - from this version I've started using AWStats in  3. There are CVE entries already for #2 (and should be for #1, but I don't know about such CVE and I've not found it in CVE database).  Open redirect vulnerability  But as I showed in my advisory in case of #2, this fix can be bypassed, so there can be made update for this CVE entry or made new entry.
