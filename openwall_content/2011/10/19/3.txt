Seems piwik decided to jump in to the projects that try to hide security issues instead of being transparent. The Changelog for piwik 1.6 lists the names of people disclosing security issues, but it doesn't give any hint of the issues itself.  Cite from "Security: we would like to thank the following people for their responsible disclosure: Alexandru Pitis, Alexander Schmid, Secure Business Austria, Krzysztof Kotowicz, David Vieira-Kurz, Szymon Gruszecki, Mateusz Goik, Mauro Gentile."  Although they have a section on their webpage with security advisories, there's none for 1.6. (reminds me of clamav, they've been doing that for years)  Regarding CVEs, i suggest adding one for every name, e.g. "Unknown security vulnerability in piwik before 1.6 discovered by Alexandru Pitis" etc., until we know more about it.   If anyone knows any piwik devs, please tell them that it'd be a good idea to get back to a transparent handling of security issues.  --  Hanno Bรถck		mail/jabber: hanno@...eck.de GPG:  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
