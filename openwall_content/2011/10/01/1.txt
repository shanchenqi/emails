The original identification of the vulnerability and bug report was made by Diego Bauche Madero from IOActive <diego.madero@...ctive.com>, and can be seen on the Pidgin bug tracker as Bug       The vulnerability lies in calling g_markup_escape_text() on strings which have not been verified as valid UTF-8.  This function is not required to do anything reasonable with invalid UTF-8, and indeed reads past the end of the string and will eventually segfault for certain sequences in some versions of Glib 2.  Because the behavior of this function is undefined, and depends on the particular version of Glib 2 in use, the complete ramifications of this bug are unknown. Remote crashing of a libpurple client by untrusted users via specifically crafted SILC messages is a verified vulnerability.  This bug is believed to affect all releases of libpurple up to and including version  The correct fix for this bug is UTF-8 validation (and correction if necessary) of the incoming string before passing it to Glib.  A patch which provides this fix has been applied to the Pidgin sources in revision and will appear in all future Pidgin releases.  For reference, it is:       All packagers of libpurple (including monolithic Pidgin and/or finch packages) who have not already done so are encouraged to apply this change to their packages immediately.  We would also like to request a CVE number for this issue.  Any sensitive follow-ups to this issue, or any other Pidgin, finch, or libpurple issue, may be directed to security@...gin.im.
