FWIW, here's how this is implemented in OpenVZ, at least in RHEL5 branch kernels:  # id uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) # sysctl -a|fgrep dmesg kernel.dmesg_restrict = 1 # sysctl -w kernel.dmesg_restrict=0 error: "Operation not permitted" setting key "kernel.dmesg_restrict" # uname -mrs Linux # dmesg klogctl: Operation not permitted  This is OpenSUSE (arbitrary, whatever I happened to have as a result of some other testing) inside an OpenVZ container on Owl. ;-)  I was actually thinking of making dmesg_restrict tri-state in OpenVZ, to have a setting that would allow dmesg to work in containers but not on host.  With OpenVZ, containers have their own dmesg buffers anyway, with very little info getting in there (e.g., output from virtualized iptables logging goes in there, but I've never seen any kernel pointer exposed in an in-container dmesg).  Fully disabling dmesg in containers just because we want it disabled for non-root on host seems overkill for some uses, but that's what is currently implemented when a host admin sets dmesg_restrict to 1.  There's room for improvement here, from a usability standpoint.  As to security, this shows that OpenVZ is mature and LXC is not. ;-)  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
