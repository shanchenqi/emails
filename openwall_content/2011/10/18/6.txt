This is caused by the fact that the X server is behaving differently   if the lock file already exists as a symbolic link pointing to an   existing or non-existing file.  o : File permission change vulnerability:   It is possible for a non-root user to set the permissions for   all users on any file or directory to giving unwanted read   access or causing denies of service (by removing execute permission).   This is caused by a race between creating the lock file and setting   its access modes.  Affected Versions - -----------------  All X.Org Xserver versions are vulnerable to when running with root privileges.  X.Org Xserver version 1.4 and later are vulnerable to when running with root privileges.  Workaround - ----------  Removing the setuid bit on the Xorg binary (and using a display manager to start it with controlled parameters) makes the issues harder to exploit, but not impossible.  Fix - ---  Those issues have been fixed by the following two git commits:    A fix of this vulnerability will be included in xserver and xserver  The X.Org Foundation thanks vladz (http://vladz.devzero.fr) for bringing this issue to our attention and helping testing the fixes.  - --  Matthieu Herrb -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =LvrS -----END PGP SIGNATURE----- _______________________________________________ xorg-announce mailing list xorg-announce@...ts.freedesktop.org http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/xorg-announce  ----- End forwarded message -----  --  Matthieu Herrb  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
