For consistency's sake, it makes sense that it should require CAP_SYS_ADMIN to modify this sysctl, and it's certainty not a bad idea to move towards a more well-defined security boundary for LXC for the future.  That's why I ack'ed the patch.  I simply meant that assigning a CVE for this case was silly because it doesn't represent a violation of a real security boundary.  -Dan  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
