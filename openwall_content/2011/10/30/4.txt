FWIW, the counter overflow could be fixed by simply using uint_64, which would overflow in 20 billion years :)   > As for the second issue, I do not think it is worth the effort to > implement SSL certificate handling in obby.

Some distros probably don't want to switch to the development version of Gobby (which also uses a different dependency), but to fix the bugs of their own stable versions.  As personally I am not a maintainer of a distro with the official Gobby support, I don't care about maintaining old versions much, though.  I'm happy with the fixes in the dev version.   > We would be pleased if you could check for similar flaws in libinfinity > though I admit that it is much more code and probably more complicated > to analyze.  OK, I'll probably look at libinfinity at my spare time as I did it with obby.
