This allows any contact to intercept your audio and video calls (as opposed to only attacker who can passively intercept your network traffic, which is the normal state of affairs for unencrypted calls).  If you think any of the others deserve an ID, let me know.  Thanks.  --      JB  ----- Original Message ----- > Can I get a CVE id for: > >  > Thanks! >  > -- > Nico Golde - http://www.ngolde.de - nion@...ber.ccc.de - GPG: > > For security reasons, all text in this mail is double-rot13 encrypted.
