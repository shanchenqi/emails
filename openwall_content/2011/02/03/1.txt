Zikula has > received praise for many things, but we belive the highlights are ease > of use, quick and easy development, security and performance and > lastly flexibility. >  >  > 3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION >  > Zikula CMS and lower versions contain a flaw that allows a > remote Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF / XSRF) attack. The flaw > exists because the application does not require multiple steps or > explicit confirmation for sensitive transactions for majority of > administrator functions such as adding new user, assigning user to > administrative privilege. By using a crafted URL, an attacker may > trick the victim into visiting to his web page to take advantage of > the trust relationship between the authenticated victim and the > application. Such an attack could trick the victim into executing > arbitrary commands in the context of their session with the > application, without further prompting or verification. >  >  > 4.
