If it couldn't update mtab, it would unmount the directory while resolving symlinks this time, resulting in a different directory being unmounted.   This prevents local users from changing the location of the current directory from under fuse using a timing attack.   Fuse uses the --no-canonicalize mount option to prevent a symlink attack on the mount point written to mtab. For backwards compatibility reasons, it would fallback to using mount in an insecure way. This fallback could get triggered by a user when an entry already existed in mtab.   All three of these issues allowed local users to trick fuse into unmounting arbitrary directories.  Marc.
