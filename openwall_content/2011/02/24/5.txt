The whole reason I lock my phone is because it's so easy for an attacker to get access to it. The thoughts of someone grabbing your desktop and running down the street with it is laughable, but I suspect this happens with phones many times every single day.  I'm expecting the whole mobile security paradigm to change quite a lot in the near future as people start to focus there. There's a lot of low hanging fruit.
