The advisory Timo posted mentioned ldm_frag_add() so it's public for all practical purposes at this point:  static bool ldm_frag_add (const u8 *data, int size, struct list_head *frags) { ...         f = kmalloc (sizeof (*f) + size*num, GFP_KERNEL);         if (!f) {                 ldm_crit ("Out of memory.");                 return false;         } ...         memcpy (f->data+rec*(size-VBLK_SIZE_HEAD)+VBLK_SIZE_HEAD, data, size);         return true; }  Regards, Jon Oberheide  --  Jon Oberheide <jon@...rheide.org> GnuPG Key: Fingerprint: DA66 6EDD  F47C 17FE  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
