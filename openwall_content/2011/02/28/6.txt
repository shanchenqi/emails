Leakage of file/directory existence via stat() calls (e.g. determining if a file exists regardless of search permissions on directories)  2. Leakage of directory existence via realpath()  3. Arbitrary MD5 comparison (e.g. ability to determine if any two files have identical MD5 hashes, regardless of read permissions on those files)  No preference for single vs. multiple CVEs.  -Dan  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
