Checking for existence of a symlink and then opening the resource leaves open a window during which a legitimate file can be replaced with a symlink.  Also, I don't see a reason why a hard link couldn't be used for exploitation instead.  -Dan  Helgi Þormar Þorbjörnsson <helgi@....net>: > The lack of symlink checks in the PEAR installer <= while doing > installation and upgrades, which initiate various system write > operations, can cause privileged users unknowingly to overwrite > critical system files. > > Further information can be found in this temporary advisory > and the > > Fixes can be found at > > - Helgi >  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
