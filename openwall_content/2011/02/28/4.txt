Local variable cinfo of type sco_conninfo is copied to userspace with this uninizialized one byte, leading to old stack contents leak."    "Struct ca is copied from userspace.  It is not checked whether the "device" field is NULL terminated.  This potentially leads to BUG() inside of alloc_netdev_mqs() and/or information leak by creating a device with a name made of contents of kernel stack."    "Struct tmp is copied from userspace.  It is not checked whether the "name" field is NULL terminated.  This may lead to buffer overflow and passing contents of kernel stack as a module name to try_then_request_module() and, consequently, to modprobe commandline. It would be seen by all userspace processes."    The vulnerable code was written before the "git epoch".  One needs CAP_NET_ADMIN to exploit the 2nd and the 3rd.   JFI, the patch to prevent the panic inside of alloc_netdev() (to prevent analogues of #2) was rejected by upstream:    Thanks,  --  Vasiliy Kulikov http://www.openwall.com - bringing security into open computing environments  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
