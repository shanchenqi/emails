While the stack guard page and the fixes[2] for certainly improved things, argv expansion can still be tricked into OOM-killing the entire system. Solutions were discussed on the original thread, but were not finished. Recently a set of patches[3] has been re-proposed to fix this issue. Regardless, it should probably get its own CVE assigned.
