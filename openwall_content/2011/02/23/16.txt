The code for evaluating LDM partitions (in fs/partitions/ldm.c) contains a bug that allows to overflow the kernel heap. It may be possible to escalate privileges by exploiting this bug.  (This bug is distinct from the LDM bug reported by Eugene Teo on  This should affect both, 2.4 and 2.6 kernel. As a prerequisite, CONFIG_LDM_PARTITION needs to be set.
