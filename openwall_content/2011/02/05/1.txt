However, I've found a lot of the security issues were published without sufficient detail to be able to review the problems.  I would really appreciate help resolving the status of the following issues.  You can see the current state of what we know in the Debian security tracker [0].  - This is a case of apple providing no useful info, but are two redhat bug reports; both of which are claim the issues fixed as of unfortunately, there is no info about the actual problems to be able to check. I suppose there is no reason to believe these are still open, but I would feel more comfortable if there were some concrete info about the problems to be able to check.  - This issue was assigned based on an academic paper, and there are no patches or fixes for reference in the CVE references. Chrome claims the issue is fixed as of version  Was webkit itself ever affected by this issue, and when was it fixed?  - According to redhat, both of these issues were fixed in the same webkit commit.  That seems a bit surprising, but may be true.  I was just wondering if anyone can confirm that the info is correct?  - This issue sounds like an iphone-specific duplicate of  If that is the case, can the two CVEs be merged?  If its a different problem, is it in iphone-specific or is webkit itself affected?  - This is claimed fixed by Vincent Danen in webkitgtk but there is no redhat bug report about it and no info available to check whether this is indeed fixed or not.  Does anyone have any info on this?  - According to redhat's info webkit commit fixes this, which is believed to be the same commit that fixes but google is still embargoing the bug report for that.  Does anyone have any info?  - This is claimed to fixed in webkitgtk but wasn't noted until after the fact. There is no info anywhere to be able to check that this statement is true.   - These are all recent apple webkit announcements without any relevant details :( Does anyone have any info to be able to check this deluge of issues?  Thanks so much for any help in advance.
