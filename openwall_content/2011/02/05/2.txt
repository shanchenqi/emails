Please merge and reject these as appropriate.  and webkit commit  and webkit commit  and webkit commit  and webkit commit and  and webkit commit  and webkit commit and  and webkit commit  and webkit commit  and webkit commit both are apple announcements, and the only difference in the CVE descriptions is "itunes" vs "safari"  and webkit commit i'm not sure about this one since there is no useful info in the descriptions sound very much the same issue, but descriptions differ by "webkit on apple" vs "webkit"  and webkit commit  and webkit commit  Would it be possible to force Google and Apple to coordinate better to avoid these dupes?  This is creating unnecessary work and making it appear that webkit has a lot more issues than it really does.
