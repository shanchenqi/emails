The OSS model more-or-less  means that all code is public.  In the ancient days of early CVE, we  considered excluding code that was only in beta, but then you had software  with extremely large user bases (sometimes in the millions)  that were in  permanent "beta," and that still happens today.  Add on the rapidly-changing nature of the Linux kernel and the fact that  so many different versions are used in so many distros and other  environments, and the amount of research that the distros seem to have to  conduct to figure out if their local kernel version is affected or not,  and the impossibility of an outsider (CVE) having full knowledge of which  code is being used where, means that CVE assignment even for release  candidates is a reasonable thing to do (the analytical expense of studying  the kernel, affected versions, and related distributions is just too high  - creating a CVE for a reported issue is much less expensive).  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
