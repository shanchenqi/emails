Correct me if I'm wrong, but it looks like all versions of xpdf and poppler <= should not be affected by this issue (since graphics states are not tracked via stackheight in those versions).  Also, according to redhat, poppler in rhel5 does not crash when tested with your poc.  Would you be willing to share so we can test that?
