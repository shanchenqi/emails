It was working since version. If in a terminal we run : echo $USER, we get the real login name.  example below :  If I put those 3 lines in /etc/gdm/PostLogin/Default:  echo $USER > /tmp/aaa.txt echo $USERNAME >> /tmp/aaa.txt echo $LOGNAME >> /tmp/aaa.txt  after every login I get this result:  $ cat /tmp/aaa.txt gdm gdm gdm  I would expect to get my real login name in those 3 variables instead of "gdm", which is of no use to take specific action based on which user is logging in. This was working as expected with at least the 3 previous versions of Ubuntu. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Cheers, Thomas  --   Thomas Biege <thomas@...e.de>, SUSE LINUX, Security Support & Auditing  SUSE LINUX Products GmbH, GF: Markus Rex, HRB (AG Nuernberg) --   Wer aufhoert besser werden zu wollen, hoert auf gut zu sein.                             -- Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
