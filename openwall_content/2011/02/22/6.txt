This prevents possible back button attacks after a user logs out.        Further issue details:       A security flaw was found in the way the RT3 ticketing       system handled resubmitting of form data after the user       has logged out of the browser (but not closed it).       A local attacker could use this flaw to access the user       account of the victim (login without providing a password       or obtain user credentials).        References:       [a]       [b]        Upstream bug report:       [c]        Upstream changeset:       [d]        Thomas, could you please confirm [d] is the proper fix for 2) issue? Thank you.       (* Redirect users to their desired pages after login.)     3) * Clone Scrip's TicketObj since we change the CurrentUser and it can leak       information (Custom field values, etc)        Further issue details:       A security flaw was found in the way the RT3 ticketing       system handled logging of SQL queries during performing       of user account transition. A remote, authenticated RT3       user could use this flaw to obtain sensitive information.        References:       [i]        [ii]        Upstream changeset (needs confirmation from upstream if it's       real fix for the issue yet):       [iii]        Shawn, could you please confirm [iii] is the proper fix for 3) issue?       (* Clone Scrip's TicketObj since we change the CurrentUser and it can leak)        If [iii] not being the correct one for 3) issue, could you point us       to the right one? Thank you.   Steve, once patches confirmed, could you allocate CVE ids for the 2), and 3) issues?
