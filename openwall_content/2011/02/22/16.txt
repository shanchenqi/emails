In all future security mail, please use our security contact address security@...tpractical.com, not developer email addresses pulled from commits.  Details for our security contact are at: http://bestpractical.com/security/  We have no context for Redhat's (and Debian's?) involvement here.  Can you bring us up to speed on your plans regarding CVEs and/or security releases in your distributions?  On 22 Feb Jan Lieskovsky wrote: >   2) * Redirect users to their desired pages after login.

Thank you. >      (* Redirect users to their desired pages after login.)  The commit you linked to is not the full fix.  As noted in our own bug report you also link to above, the fix was merged into 3.8-trunk with commit  That said, what are your plans for the diffset?  The commit itself can't be used as a standalone patch for the issue.  It introduced a few other bugs in core RT and broke the current stable versions of RT-Authen-ExternalAuth (a very popular, critical extension).  The bugs have been fixed by other commits and there are development releases of a fixed ExternalAuth.  Are you trying to package a patch in a security update?  >   3) * Clone Scrip's TicketObj since we change the CurrentUser and it > can leak >      information (Custom field values, etc) >  [snip] >      Upstream changeset (needs confirmation from upstream if it's >      real fix for the issue yet): >      [iii] > >  >  >      Shawn, could you please confirm [iii] is the proper fix for 3) issue? >      (* Clone Scrip's TicketObj since we change the CurrentUser and it > can leak)  The above commit is an unrelated bug fix.  The correct commit is however we've never tested it as a standalone fix.  Again, what are your plans?
