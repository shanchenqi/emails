They don't sound like security flaws.  There is more information on these here:   # Fix XSS bug: Properly encode title used in Quick/Bulk Edit, and offer   additional sanitization to various fields. Affects users of the Author or   Contributor role. # Fix XSS bug: Preserve tag escaping in the tags meta box. Affects users of   the Author or Contributor role.  Use for the XSS flaws.   # Fix potential information disclosure of posts through the media uploader.   Affects users of the Author role.  Use for the information disclosure.
