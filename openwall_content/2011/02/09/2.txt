Since they were all introduced at once and fixed at the same time, one CVE should suffice.  Due to integer truncation or a signedness error in a typecasted comparison, an integer overflow in an allocation size calculation, and a failure to properly check bounds when copying data, it was possible for an unprivileged user to cause a denial-of-service due to writing to an invalid pointer (ZERO_SIZE_PTR) or cause a kernel heap overflow.  -Dan  [1]  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
