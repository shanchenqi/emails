But according to latest and description  assignment, there seems to be a type (rounded / cycled definition of both):  ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: [Open URL] Final-Decision: Interim-Decision: Modified: Proposed: Assigned: Category:  ** REJECT **  DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER. ConsultIDs: Reason: This candidate is a duplicate of Notes: All CVE users should reference instead of this candidate. All references and descriptions in this candidate have been removed to prevent accidental usage.  This one should mention in the body (based on the reply below).  ====================================================== Name: Status: Candidate URL: [Open URL] Final-Decision: Interim-Decision: Modified: Proposed: Assigned: Category:  ** REJECT **  DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER.

All references and descriptions in this candidate have been removed to prevent accidental usage.  This one should use in the body, based on:  Could you correct these two yet?
