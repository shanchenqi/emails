The rbtdb.c part of the patch uses RDATASET_ATTR_NEGATIVE attribute but this attribute is never set. However the query.c part of the patch is correct and in my opinion it's sufficient to prevent the crash."  This confirms my understanding that the changes to rbtdb.c were a no-op in 9.3.x and it adds the opinion that the changes to query.c are both needed and sufficient to prevent the crash.  So do we (distro vendors) choose to go ahead and release updates with just those changes for now?  So far, I haven't heard a single report of 9.3.x crashing in the wild (ours are running fine, too, but most of them are built without DNSSEC), and several reports regarding newer versions crashing.  It's a pity that we do not have a reproducer even though the crashes are happening in the wild.
