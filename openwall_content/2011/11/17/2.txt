So I downloaded and verified signatures, diff'ed these two trees, and then tried to apply the resulting patch to (just whatever version we happen to need a patch for - obviously, only in case it is actually affected).  The result of this is inconclusive.  On one hand, the code being patched is mostly present in as well, but on the other the checks that the patch adds to lib/dns/rbtdb.c use the NEGATIVE() macro, which is not present in  While back-porting this macro definition is trivial, and I've done just that, this source file in lacks other likely relevant pieces of code, including this one present in lib/dns/rbtdb.c: addrdataset():  			newheader->attributes |= RDATASET_ATTR_NEGATIVE;  If can't set this flag, then perhaps not checking for it was not a problem.  Then the question becomes whether the fixes to bin/named/query.c are required even when lib/dns/rbtdb.c did not have the problem.  In other words, are these a security fix for a separate attack vector (even if a similar one) or merely a hardening measure? Or are the changes to lib/dns/rbtdb.c merely a hardening measure?  I am not familiar with this code and with the specific attack(s), so I don't know the answers.  I've attached the to diffs, and a "patch" against - even though in the latter the changes to lib/dns/rbtdb.c are almost certainly not needed, as I explained above.  Also, is BIND built without DNSSEC support affected?  The ISC advisory does not mention DNSSEC and RRSIG, but mentions RRSIG, which is a DNSSEC thing.  (Yes, we build BIND without DNSSEC on Owl currently since DNSSEC proved to be more of a risk than a solution so far - and it looks like we have yet another example here. This is going to change, though, as DNSSEC gets deployed in more places. So we might have to revert that temporary decision and re-include DNSSEC support already in our next release.)  I am still looking for more conclusive info and more detail on this.
