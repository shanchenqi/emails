This has been demonstrated to be exploitable to escalate privileges to root on all Froyo (2.2.x) and Gingerbread (2.4.x)  devices via freeing an arbitrary heap object and triggering a use-after-free condition [1]. It appears the bug was silently patched in Honeycomb (3.x), but note that since Honeycomb is not open source, it does not fall within the scope of this list.  Bug discovered and exploited by the Revolutionary team [2].  -Dan  [1] https://github.com/revolutionary/zergRush/blob/master/zergRush.c [2] http://revolutionary.io/  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
