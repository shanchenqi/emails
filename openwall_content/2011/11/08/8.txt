This can lead to a root compromise. Note that Linux-PAM is entirely different as forbids anything with '/' inside.  Please see    for more discussion and PoC. This most likely affects FreeBSD and Solaris via the kcheckpass vector.  regards, Sebastian   --   ~ perl self.pl ~ ~ krahmer@...e.de - SuSE Security Team  --- SUSE LINUX Products GmbH, GF: Jeff Hawn, Jennifer Guild, Felix Imendörffer, HRB (AG Nürnberg) Maxfeldstraße 5 Nürnberg Germany   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
