The information about keyboard interrupts number may be used to learn the precise number of characters in users' passwords by simply watching the changes of number of emitted interrupts during the life of gksu-like programs."  PoC:  Vulnerable: all Linux versions, all distros with procfs mounted.  (The patch misses the same infoleak via /proc/stat, which must be closed too.)   2)  The same as (1), but via tty devices' atime and mtime.  "You can still figure it out by watching the files in /dev/pts/ and /dev/tty* for changes in last-modify time."  Vulnerable: all Linux versions, all distros with world readable directories containing tty and pts device files.   3)  "/proc/$PID/{sched,schedstat} contain debugging scheduler counters, which should not be world readable.  They may be used to gather private information about processes' activity.  E.g. it can be used to count the number of characters typed in gksu dialog."  PoC:  Vulnerable: all Linux >= all distros with procfs mounted.   These are not fixed yet, the solution might be introducing revoke() with permission restrictions, see the first link in (1) with the discussion.   Also, security@...nel.org is unavailable, is there any substitution of this email?
