So this can't really be backported to v1.x.  My v2.0 change keeps this backwards compatible with existing setups that use IP addresses, so that the hostname check is skipped when connecting with IP.  Upcoming v2.1 is stricter and doesn't skip the check, which basically means that ssl=yes with IP address as destination always fails.
