Of course, it'd be non-obvious where to stop (do we add Microsoft if they ask to join?), but for now I'd like to see who is interested in joining - and be liberal in accepting them.  I'd expect to add *BSD's, Apple, Solaris - but we need to hear from specific people that they're interested.  So please reply to this message to indicate your interest and we'll proceed.  I intend to include the linux-distros members on this new list as well. I have difficulty imagining an issue that would affect several diverse distros, but obviously (to the sender) not affect any Linux distros. I don't mind setting up a third list that would exclude Linux if there's demand, though.  I'd appreciate any comments.  Thanks,  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
