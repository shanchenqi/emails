A remote attacker could use this flaw to conduct man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks via specially- crafted certificate.  References: [1] [2] [3] [4] http://wiki.dovecot.org/PasswordDatabase/ExtraFields/Proxy  Relevant upstream patch: [5]  Could you allocate a CVE id for this?  Note: This isn't a 'direct security flaw', in the sense it would be discovered / reported at some time point. This behaviour (do not check cert CN against remote server hostname), when TLS/SSL protocols are configured, and the danger of MITM is already described on relevant Dovecot's page: http://wiki.dovecot.org/PasswordDatabase/ExtraFields/Proxy  thus one could say, for those administrators, who are aware of [4] page and configured Dovecot in safe way there is no trust boundary crossing and this upstream change is just security hardening.  But on the other hand, this change is important enough, to be backported to all affected versions, (regardless to the fact if particular administrator has or hasn't read [4]). Thus I would vote for a CVE identifier to be assigned to this issue. But opened for discussion if someone else (MITRE?) thinks this should be dealt with rather as with security hardening, than with a real security flaw.
