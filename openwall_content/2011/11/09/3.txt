Due to a deficiency in a way the libsocialweb service was initialized, an untrusted (non-SSL) network connection has been opened to remote Twitter service servers without explicit approval of the user, running the libsocialweb service on the local host. A remote attacker could use this flaw to conduct various MITM attacks and potentially alter integrity of the user account in question.  References: [1]  Could you allocate a CVE id for this?  Thank you && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team  P.S.: This one being on the border a bit (since clear security        consequences of this deficiency not completely investigated),        but in any case it's a bad programming practice to open        untrusted connection to remote servers by default without        particular users' approval (trust boundary crossing).
