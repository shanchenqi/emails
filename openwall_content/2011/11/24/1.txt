Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: kernel: nfsv4: mknod(2) DoS  This only affects the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. It is possible to trigger the BUG() in fs/nfs/nfs4xdr.c on a NFSv4 mount. This patch fixed the problem, although we only backported the relevant parts of the patch,   Thanks, Eugene  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
