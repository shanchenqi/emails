I was under the impression that there was general agreement that NULL derefs that are handled gracefully are not security bugs any more.  Is this because you're setting panic_on_oops?  I wonder if we should create a separate panic_on_null, as I agree panic_on_oops is probably the correct default so as to avoid transitioning into a potentially exploitable state. I think I'm reasonably confident in the handling of NULL derefs (or am I deluded? I havn't thought about it a great deal).
