Volkerding" <security@...ckware.com> To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com CC: solar@...nwall.com Subject: linux-distros Slackware membership  Hello Alexander,  I believe I was supposed to be subscribed with my security at slackware  dt com address (only read by me), but have never received any messages  from the list.  Unless there's some reason that Slackware was not  included (and in that case I would be curious why, and how the situation  could be rectified), could you subscribe me?  My GPG key is:  pub   [expires: uid                  Slackware Linux Project <security@...ckware.com>   Thanks!
