Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> CC: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: CVE Request -- python-celery / Celery v2.4 -- Privilege escalation  due improper sanitization of --uid and --gid arguments in certain tools  Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,     a privilege escalation flaw was found in the way 'celeryd-multi', 'celeryd_detach', 'celerybeat' and 'celeryev' tools of the Celery, an asynchronous task queue based on distributed message passing, performed sanitization of --uid and --gid arguments, provided to the tools on the command line (only effective user id was changed, with the real one remaining unchanged). A local attacker could use this flaw to send messages via the message broker or use the Pickle serializer to load and execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.
