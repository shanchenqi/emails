I work for the Gentoo security team, and I am not sure whether it would be beneficial for me to be on the closed list or not. It is my presumption that the release of non-Linux vulnerabilities might better help us identify vulnerabilities across the board. If you do not believe this is the case, please disregard my request to be on the closed. I apologize for any extra work my request caused you. I caught the middle of the thread, and may have missed something along the way.
