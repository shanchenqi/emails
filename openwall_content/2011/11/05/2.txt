Use of env vars is unsafe in a potentially SUID script, but I don't know what the current policy regarding this is in CPAN.  Are CPAN modules by default supposed to be safe for use in SUID Perl scripts or not - I guess not, or we'd have plenty of CVE ids for those issues by now?  An alternative would be to find the home directory path from the real UID.
