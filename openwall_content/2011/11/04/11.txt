Everybody should check out for a good example of how * not* to respond to security bug reports. Quite amusing. It's been a fun couple of days writing weaponized exploit after exploit.<http://git.zx2c4.com/calibre-mount-helper-exploit/tree/>  In the end though, it looks like he agreed to fix it, "@Jason: Well, if you do not wish to help, that leaves me with no choice but to remove the mount helper."  So where does that leave us with the CVEs? Well, there are the issues that were "released" with a "version" of Calibre, and then the trove of bugs he introduced in the middle. I'll try to recap and separate which is which:  1. Ability to create root owned directory anywhere. The mount helper calls mkdir(argv[3], ...).  2. Ability to remove any empty directory on the system.  3. Ability to create user_controlled_dir/.created_by_calibre_mount_helper anywhere on the filesystem.  4. Ability to delete user_controlled_dir/.created_by_calibre_mount_helper anywhere on the filesystem.  5. Ability to inject arguments into 'mount' being exec'd. On lines 78, 81, and 83, the final two arguments to mount are user controlled. On lines and the last argument to unmount/eject is user controlled. The "exists()" check can be subverted via race condition or by creating an existing file in the working directory with a filename equal to the desired injected argument.  6. Ability to execute any program as root. The mount helper makes use of execlp on lines 78, 81, 83, and and the first argument does not start with a / character. Because of this, execlp will search PATH for the executable to run. PATH is user controlled, and thus it is trivial to write a program that spawns a shell and give it "mount" as a filename, and direct PATH to its directory.  7. Ability to mount any device to anywhere. This leads to local root, since you can mount over /etc/ or /etc/pam.d/ or choose-your-own-adventure.  --- bugs introduced along the saga: ---  8. Race with checking for /dev  9. Race with checking for /media  10. Race with symlinks  11. Another race with symlinks  12. Another race with symlinks  13. ...  14. Probably more things.   Probably CVEs are only assigned for issues 1-7, though? Should these be grouped together in anyway, or should there be 7 CVEs assigned?
