Symlink A points to foo/bar Symlink B points to /some/real/directory  Code asks for /tmp/parent/childXXXX  Attacker hardlinks symlink A to /tmp/parent Attacker creates /tmp/foo directory Attacker hardlinks symlink B to /tmp/foo/bar  Now everything looks safe, but it relies on the attacker controled /tmp/foo directory.  It'd probably be simplest if File::Temp::_is_safe() didn't allow any symlinks at all. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org/  =B77I -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
