Add repeated crashes and  you can have a substantive DoS on your hands.  For "passive" intermediaries like IDS and sniffers that just monitor  traffic, a crash/DoS can lead to loss of visibility/awareness (passing  traffic doesn't get captured), which can allow an attacker to hide  activities.  - Steve   On Mon, 31 Oct Henrik Nordström wrote:  > mĂĽn klockan skrev Kurt Seifried: > >>> Could you allocate a CVE id for this?
