One has a CVE assigned (rather, it moodle repackages phpMyAdmin which has a CVE assigned), several are security hardening fixes (so no CVE) and several require admin access (so they don't cross a security boundary, so no CVE). Notes are included.  I also found I'm unable to confirm this issue (I just get a internal server error) but would indicate it's been fixed.  P.S. could someone from moodle maybe request CVE's when they assign a security advisory (just forward a copy of the MSA to the OSS list would do the trick), barrnig that if a community member could take it upon themselves that would be nice (then CVE's can be assigned promptly).  =====================  ALREADY ASSIGNED Customised phpMyAdmin upgraded to and  Cross-site request forgery vulnerability in RSS block  Cross-site scripting vulnerability in tag autocomplete  $CFG->forceloginforprofiles setting ignored in course profiles  Cross-site scripting vulnerability in spikephpcoverage  Cross-site request forgery and missing access control in course completion  Cross-site scripting vulnerability in course tags  IMS enterprise enrolment file may disclose sensitive information  My profile block may disclose private information if used in user context  Incorrect default for mod:course/delete capability in teacher role  Multiple cross-site scripting problems in media filter  Authentication issue  Group/Quiz permissions issue  Personal details displayed without permission  Cross Site Scripting through URL encoding  Ability to fill a database with invalid records through ratings  Ability to generate invalid records in the comments table in the database  NO CVE Lacking capability controls over cohorts (hardening)  Themes writing to files outside Moodle data directory  Continue links in error messages can lead offsite  Role assignment web service function not following restrictions  Course creators could change filters at course level  Guests can add comments to front page activities  NO CVE Recaptcha images were being authenticated from an older server (hardening)  NO CVE Group names in user upload CSV not being escaped (need to be admin)  NO CVE Fields in user upload CSV not being escaped (need to be admin)  Wiki pages reference forgery issue  Wiki comments cross site scripting issue  File visibility issue  NO CVE Box.net repository integration authentication issue (hardening)  Forms API constant issue  MNET SSL validation issue  Site-hub registration identity issue  Chat module information leak  NO CVE Cookie-less session vulnerability (hardening)  Messaging refresh vulnerability  Course section editing injection vulnerability  NO CVE Database injection protection strengthened (hardening)  Wiki section vulnerability  Potential personal information leak  Global search authentication issue  --  Kurt Seifried / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
