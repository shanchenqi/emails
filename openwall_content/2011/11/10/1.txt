Google is a CNA (CVE Numbering Authority), and we've already assigned this vulnerability To avoid confusion, I would appreciate it if would be considered the authoritative CVE for this vulnerability, and should be marked as a duplicate. More information on the vold vulnerability, including a patch, can be found at  For the record, Google maintains several security contact mailing lists.  In general, you can reach Google security by e-mailing security@...gle.com or visiting http://www.google.com/about/corporate/company/security.html  For Android specific security issues, the preferred e-mail address is security@...roid.com, or you can visit http://developer.android.com/resources/faq/security.html#issue  For Chrome specific security issues, the preferred e-mail address is security@...omium.org, or you can visit http://dev.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/reporting-security-bugs  In general, e-mailing security@...gle.com will eventually get to Chrome or Android, although it's faster to contact the product specific security alias first.  Because Google is a CNA, we maintain our own pool of CVEs from Mitre. Any of the addresses above can issue CVEs for Google related vulnerabilities.
