Currently in FreeBSD, crypt-md5.c: crypt_md5() has extra static declarations (not only the output buffer, but also three pointers), and it forgets to zeroize ctx and ctx1 (even though it does zeroize final).  md5crypt.c: __md5crypt() in NetBSD no longer has the extra statics, but it does forget to zeroize ctx and ctx1.  md5crypt.c: md5crypt() in OpenBSD has the weird static pointers and forgets to zeroize ctx and ctx1.  Not a big deal, but worth fixing, I think.  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
