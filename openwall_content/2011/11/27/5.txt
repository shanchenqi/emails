I have mixed > feelings about these advance notification lists myself.  Oh, I think I need to clarify.  By "these messages" above, I mean closed list membership requests that lack justification.  I can see how my positive reply to Tim's message might have created the false impression that no justification was required.  In fact, NetBSD/pkgsrc had previously expressed interest in being on such a list (during the "closed list" thread from half a year ago), Tim posted from his @pkgsrc address, and I verified that he was credited for pkgsrc security work just recently:   "pkgsrc security: OBATA Akio, Guillaume Lasmayous, Fredrik Pettai, Tim Zingelman"  None of these things were true for Joost's and Michael's requests - so I had no better choice than to ask them for justification.  It'd help avoid any confusion like that if further requests include justification in a more explicit form, even when the sender can reasonably expect that I'd recognize their OS and themselves and their involvement in security work for their OS.  While I did recall past discussions and notice the @pkgsrc address, not everyone did, which clearly caused confusion.
