Patrick I only report here on the list because I sent an email to 30 days and getting no return. It would be a bug that affected the slackware developers.  But if you want to play a scenario, okay. Simply just change the variable mount point to a directory other than / mnt and try to run the default installation of Slackware, so you have a broken installation.  Thank you for your attention.
