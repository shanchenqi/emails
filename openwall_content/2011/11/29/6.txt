Alexandre Emsenhuber discovered an issue where page titles on private wikis could be exposed bypassing different page ids to index.php. In the case of the user not having correct permissions, they will now be redirected to Special:BadTitle.  For more details, see  The second issue was found by Tim Starling, who discovered that action=ajax requests were dispatched to the relevant function without any read permission checks being done. This could have led to data leakage on private wikis.
