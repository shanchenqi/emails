Volkerding" <security@...ckware.com> To: Raphael Bastos <tecnologia@...tosservice.com.br> CC: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: Re: Fwd: Bug script install slackware  Hello,  While I'm sure there are a number of bugs in the crufty old installer  scripts, I'll need to know how there's a security impact before  notifying everyone that the sky has fallen.  I'd also like to note that  if running the installer requires physical access to the machine I'm  liable to consider security to already be non-existent at that time.  Please clarify what is wrong with examples of how to reproduce the  issue, and I'll look into it.  Thanks.
