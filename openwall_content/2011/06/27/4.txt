Hmm. Should we just round them down to 1kB boundaries or something? People *do* want to know about IO accounting, but I agree that giving things at a byte granularity ends up giving way too much information. When you can see how many bytes something read off a tty, that's a problem.  Returning accounting information at a 1k granularity should make it impractical to use that to guess keys etc. It still gives *some* information (and enough for rough statistics), but it doesn't give the level of detail required for any simple attack.  Sometimes excessive precision isn't a good thing.  Andrew - the IO_ACCT stuff went through you (back in the taskstats did too, methinks. Comments?
