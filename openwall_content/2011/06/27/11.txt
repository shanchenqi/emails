We're considering the state we'll be in after upgrade to fixed code. 0xff is the only known practical way to have a correctly computed hash match one computed by the buggy code in cases where the latter was in fact computed incorrectly.  Since a large subset of such incorrectly computed hashes had some of the original passwords' characters ignored, some working passwords for them are too easy to find, including in some cases passwords that will work even after the bug in the code is fixed. Those passwords will contain specifically the 0xff character.  This is why we may want to treat the 0xff character specially.
