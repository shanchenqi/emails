Ok, so taking a quick look at php-suhosin, we have:  ...   61 typedef unsigned int BF_word; ...     BF_word tmp;      for (i = 0; i < BF_N + 2; i++) {         tmp = 0;         for (j = 0; j < 4; j++) {             tmp <<= 8;             tmp |= *ptr;  I'm assuming the above means it is vulnerable (unsigned int vs unsigned char).  --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
