Are you considering this a flaw, or just an interesting security exercise? Nothing currently comes to mind, but it's possible there could be other data where knowing it exists and the size would be useful. I'm thinking this isn't terribly dangerous for something like ssh.  This is very interesting either way. Well done.  --      JB  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
