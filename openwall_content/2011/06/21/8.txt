I only did a code review, I didn't test the actual functionality to make that determination.  So Crypt::Eksblowfish uses the same code but wasn't affected?

I'd appreciate any help with those reviews/testing.  I can't promise I will have time to look at it, but I will try if I can find the time.  --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
