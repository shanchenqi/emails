It's really one issue, which isn't actually fixed in su.  The fundamental issue is that tools like su and sudo keep the tty open. The patch in question closes the tty for the case of su -c, but not for just running su by itself. It is incomplete.  It should get a ID at the very least, MITRE will have to do that. Perhaps two IDs? One for the issue, the second for the incomplete fix (which is still not fixed)?  I think the bigger issue is it needs to be decided what is proper behavior and document that. I'm not smart enough to know if this can be fixed properly without crippling these tools.  Thanks.  --      JB  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
