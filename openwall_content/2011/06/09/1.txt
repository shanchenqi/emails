Note that you already have the setsid() patch in Fedora since so it actually didn't break that much I guess :-) You also have the runuser program with is basically su without authentication. runuser is specifically intended for use by root to run programs as unprivileged user.  FWIW I've found ikiwiki-mass-rebuild to be vulnerable to the tty hijacking issue too. Upstream was rather quick to switch to using su¹ now. ikiwiki-mass-rebuild is also intended to be called in package post scripts. I wouldn't be surprised if there are other packages that run su to perform some operation as unprivileged user in %post.  So we would like to release a coreutils security update which adds the setsid patch.  cu Ludwig  [1]  --   (o_   Ludwig Nussel  //\  V_/_  http://www.suse.de/ SUSE LINUX Products GmbH, GF: Jeff Hawn, Jennifer Guild, Felix Imendörffer, HRB (AG Nürnberg)   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
