That's great.  However, fix > information is missing.

Yes, having the cve listed means it is fixed.

I will put that on my list for version 2 requirements.  >  > Also, no info on CVEs yet.  Does this mean we'd have to wait > until to get an idea on how you're handling security issues?  Correct. I have an internal business requirement to delay public notifications for 6 months in order to give our customers time to propagate our fixes to their customers. If our internal processes are working, then CVE's should start showing up sometime this month.  >  > That said, you do look like a security-conscious Linux distro vendor > now (and you meet some other requirements), so you're on the list. >  Many thanks.
