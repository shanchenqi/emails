Just so that the list archives reflect the actual fix:  The fixed fetchmail version runs the SSL_connect() [OpenSSL] under a real-time setitimer() that triggers SIGALRM after a user-configurable setting (default s).  SO_KEEPALIVE takes more than two hours on some systems' defaults before even sending the first TCP keepalive probe, which is too long, but can be tuned through sysctl or ndd on many relevant systems -- and, more importantly, bears no relation to what happens up in the application layer. That's what I meant with "does not defend against malice" (for instance, a server deliberately keeping the TCP connection open without responding), and that situation is what the real-time setitimer() will signal.  --  Matthias Andree  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
