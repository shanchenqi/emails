Released with VulnDisco 8.8 pack (release date   Hello, Josh, Steve, vendors,     A new security flaw, potentially allowing execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the OpenOffice.org suite tools has been reported by the InteVyDis security researchers team: [1] http://intevydis.com/oo_0day.html [2]  References: [3]  Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be further detailed information available right now. But from the Twitter post, looks this issue is still valid against OpenOffice.org v3.3.  Hopefully Evgeny Legerov of InteVyDis security researchers team (Cc-ed) could provide further background information about this issue, i.e. if it is an old issue (like date of would suggest) and thus a CVE identifier has been already assigned to this issue or is this completely new issue (which did not get fixed from till now) and thus it  requires a new CVE id.  Evgeny, any further information you could provide here, to clear the CVE doubt is really appreciated.  Once the CVE doubt cleared, could you allocate a CVE id for this issue?
