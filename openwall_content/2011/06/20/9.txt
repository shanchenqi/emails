No, I agree your proposed approach lends a more general solution which could be applied to the use cases I was considering. I saw you mention it over on the crypto list as well, but it sounded like you were trying to find ways to avoid a new hash encoding identifier in the wild which could conflict with something OpenBSD might consider assigning for some other purpose at a later date (though assuming this workaround makes it onto their radar, that seems an unlikely situation anyway). --  { IRL(Jeremy_Stanley); WWW(http://fungi.yuggoth.org/); WHOIS(STANL3-ARIN); SMTP(fungi@...goth.org); FINGER(fungi@...goth.org); IRC(fungi@....yuggoth.org#ccl); YAHOO(crawlingchaoslabs); AIM(dreadazathoth); }  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
