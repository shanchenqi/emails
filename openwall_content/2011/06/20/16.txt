So while unaligned accesses like this should be avoided, I don't think there's a security impact.  Anyone who knows better, please correct me if I'm wrong.  -Dan  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
