Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE request: kernel: thp: madvise on top of /dev/zero private  mapping can lead to panic  Description of problem: The huge_memory.c THP page fault was allowed to run if vm_ops was null (which would succeed for /dev/zero MAP_PRIVATE, as the f_op->mmap wouldn't setup a special vma->vm_ops and it would fallback to regular anonymous memory) but other THP logics weren't fully activated for vmas with vm_file not NULL (/dev/zero has a not NULL vma->vm_file).  Unprivileged local user could use this flaw to crash the server.
