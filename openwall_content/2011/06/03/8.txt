A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a hang of an end-user application, relying of the proper services of the dirmngr daemon, via a request to verify a specially-crafted certificate."  But simultaneously with filling that Red Hat Bugzilla issue tracking system entry performed some basic investigation, results of which can be seen at: [6]  IOW was not able to reproduce the complete / indefinite dirmngr-client hang (thus blocking other clients from access). As noted in [6], it is true that during small time period running 'dirmngr' daemon instance is unresponsive also for '--ping' (dirmngr-client --ping) commands, but after finite time (~21 seconds in my test) the connection ends up with timeout.  Though Bernard in: [7]  mentions "For example the KMail hung when trying to verify a signature which has the certificate in the chain." which would suggest there may exist clients / end-user application not able to recover from this bug properly. Bernhard, hopefully here, you could clarify / list such applications and provide also time details, how long that hang of such applications took.  Based on your reply, this may not / may be worthy (in case there are such end-user applications) of an CVE identifier.
