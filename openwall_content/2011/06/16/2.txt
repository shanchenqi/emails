The behavior of -c changed and since dependencies to this tool are not traced, there were no other ways than grep'ing the whole distro for those two letters 'su' to prepare the transition.  One first step could be to compare their features and behaviors   PS: regarding the original issue, was the CVE requested? I would need the     number for documentation purpose.
