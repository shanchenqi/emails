This certainly is a nice enhancement, that makes it a lot easier to find specific mail in the web archive.  > Suggestions/votes for further enhancements are welcome (we have a > to-do list for blists internally, but we're unsure of what to work on > next).  Thread view is what other archive managers tend to provide.  It's usually more convenient for navigating through longer / more complex threads than only thread-prev / thread-next.  Most archive managers split archive on the month boundary, which breaks threads view, but, guessing from what you've written, it seems blists should not suffer form such problem.  For oss-security, there's also a gmane hosted archive which already offers a rather nice thread view.  It also provides short links to views that only show specific thread, with option to focus on a particular post. I'd expect you don't plan to compete with gmane feature set, but there surely is some inspiration to be found there if you're after ideas.  --  Tomas Hoger  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
