(bug I don't remember if these bugs were reported for su). In my case, I would prefer to keep the su non-PAM variant as long as I would support non-PAM variants for the other tools (or as long as I support su).  Regarding distros without PAM, there might be gentoo to be counted in the list (although PAM is enabled by default).
