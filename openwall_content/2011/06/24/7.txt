Just to add that on some (perhaps all) ARM plateforms char is by default: "unsigned" (unless you compile with -fsigned-char as you have noted).  This is an old link that expose some problems when you just use 'char var' on ARM (perhaps not only on ARM): http://www.arm.linux.org.uk/docs/faqs/signedchar.php  --  tixxdz http://opendz.org  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
