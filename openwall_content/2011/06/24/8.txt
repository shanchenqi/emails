However, an expanding mremap() can take such a non-wrapping mapping and make it bigger and cause a wrapping condition. There is also another case where we expand mappings hiding in plain sight: the automatic stack expansion.  The wrapping condition can cause a BUG_ON() due to terminally confusing the vma_prio_tree code.  Upstream patches: mremap stack expansion downwards stack expansion upwards  References:  Thanks, --  Petr Matousek / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
