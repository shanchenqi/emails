A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted GIF image, which once opened in an application, linked against gdk-pixbuf would lead to gdk-pixbuf to return partially initialized pixbuf structure, possibly having huge width and height, leading to that particular application termination due excessive memory use.  The CVE identifier of has been assigned to this issue.  References:  [1] [2]   This issue could lead (for example) in Pidgin to: =================================================  A remote attacker could set a specially-crafted GIF image as their buddy icon that could lead to Pidgin being terminated due to excessive memory use.  References: [3] [4] http://www.pidgin.im/news/security/?id=52  Credit: Issue has been discovered and reported by Mark Doliner          of the Pidgin project.  We did not allocate a second CVE identifier for the Pidgin issue, since the true underlying reason for this was the gdk-pixbuf image  loading library problem. This is based on last paragraph from: [5]  more exactly on that part about 'issues like incorrectly reporting error status from an API function' (although this not being case of compiler, but rather case of library).
