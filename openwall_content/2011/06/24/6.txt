It can be used to learn ssh and ftp password length.  If privsep is enabled in openssh and vsftpd, the unprivileged process' activity very precisely shows password information.  For vsftpd read characters count is strlen("USER username\r\n") + strlen("PASSWD pass\r\n") + 1, where 1 is one byte read from a pipe related to a privileged parent.  If measure statistics between user and passwords commands, actual password length and username length can be gathered.  For ssh, vice versa, networking activity is constant in packets length, but interprocess communications, specifically passwords, depend on user input.  For ssh pass_len = wchars - CONST, for vsftpd pass_len = rchars - CONST.  Another daemons with more or less constant io activity might be vulnerable too.  PAM greatly complicates precise measurements.   I think it needs 2 CVE, one for /proc/PID/io and another for taskstats.
