Well, you're not running arbitrary things, you're running commands as a less priviledged user under the assumption that it will be restricted to that user.  The scenario of having this less priviledged user compromised without admin knowledge is not far from real.  I, for instance, use su -u to run commands as the www user, what are the odds of that user being compromised without my knowledge? The last thing I want is having a way for that compromised user to run arbitrary commands as any other user.
