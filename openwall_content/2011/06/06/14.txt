Just to correct / tune up the impact a bit yet: "A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause memory pressure (kernel OOM killer protection mechanism to be activated and potentially terminate vsftpd or arbitrary [vsftpd independent] process, which satisfied the OOM killer process selection algorithm)."  Based on record of apache2 process termination in:  Thanks to Petr Matousek for pointing this out.
