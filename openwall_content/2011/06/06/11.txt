It's well known, and sadly not easy to fix. There are more details in this bug:  I would classify this as an administration issue, not a flaw in su or sudo. If you're running arbitrary things, you're in far more trouble than this.  I'm happy to let MITRE overrule me.  --      JB  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
