A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a memory pressure and denial of the vsftpd service.  References: [1] [2] [3]  This one being a bit tricky one -- from my understanding of the issue, vsftpd doesn't necessarily have a security flaw on its side. It's kernel issue / bug, which allows this to be used for vsftpd DoS: [4] [5]  Short-term solution would be probably to address this on the vsftpd side, the long-term one then being to get this fixed in kernel.  Though not sure, how it would be wrt to CVE identifier(s) assignment.  Steve, could you advice here?
