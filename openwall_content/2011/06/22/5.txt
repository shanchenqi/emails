The level of effort involved depends on whether or not you need job control to work between the user's tty and the command running in the pty.  Sudo proxies job control signals via an extra process so that for, e.g. "sudo vi foo", the vi process be suspended by ^Z even when it is running in a pty.  I don't think that people using "su -c command" have the same expectations so it is probably not worth the extra effort.   - todd  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
