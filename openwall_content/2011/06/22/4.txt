It is incomplete.  I'm not worried too much about the interactive su case really. The  usual direction there is user->root, not the other way around I  suppose. "su -c" might be used by (%post) scripts though as seen  with ikiwiki. Wrt non-interactive sudo I'm not sure. It's less likely to be used  by sane packages at least as it's behavior is rather unpredictable  due to it's many configuration options.  >It should get a ID at the very least, MITRE will have to do that. >Perhaps two IDs?

As I just found out there's also code missing to make sudo actually  honor the option in the config (patch attached, CC'd upstream). Introducing similar code in su would be possible but requires some  programming effort. sudo has a liberal licence though so the code  could probably be reused.  cu Ludwig  --    (o_   Ludwig Nussel   //\   V_/_  http://www.suse.de/ SUSE LINUX Products GmbH, GF: Jeff Hawn, Jennifer Guild, Felix ImendĂśrffer, HRB (AG NĂźrnberg)   View attachment of type "text/x-patch" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
