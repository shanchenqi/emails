It may lead to a bloated listeners chain and very slow process terminations. E.g. after 10KK sent TASKSTATS_CMD_ATTR_REGISTER_CPUMASKs Mb of kernel memory is stolen for the handlers chain and "time id" shows 2-7 seconds instead of normal  It makes it possible to exhaust all kernel memory and to eat much of CPU time by triggerring numerous exits on a single CPU.  The patch limits the number of times a single process may register itself on a single CPU to one."  It makes it possible for unprivileged user eat kernel memory and CPU without triggering OOM killer.
