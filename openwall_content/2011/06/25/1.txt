PAM greatly complicates precise measurements.  Based on the code review, OpenVZ containers limit the threat of information gathering to a single container.  E.g. a process in CT cannot gather any io information of a process in CT  Some other restricting policies might limit the information too, e.g. grsecurity chroot protection denies sending taskstats commands (if the socket is already opened and TASKSTATS_CMD_ATTR_REGISTER_CPUMASK is handled before chroot(2), it doesn't help).   BTW, I'd appreciate if somebody points me how information stored in sched, schedstats, stat, and status files can be exploited.  I suspect it can be used similar way.   Other thoughts:  Files mountinfo, mounts store information related to the process' fs namespace.  I feel this information can be somewhat private, e.g. mount points can reveal private file pathes in case of separate namespaces where this information cannot be learned by reading /proc/self/mountinfo.  Files limits and status store process related restrictions.  I dunno whether this can be considered as a private information in some situations.
