Thanks, so, let me see if I got this: the original password contained some  8bit chars (0xff or not doesn't matter), the buggy hashes lead to easily  finding passwords with the same hash, some of those conflicting passwords  might have 0xff chars in them, and _those_ then will sometimes still  produce a hash conflict even with the fixed blowfish code.  If so, treating passwords containing 0xff special seems sensible.   Ciao, Michael.
