Wondering if you have contacted phpMyAdmin Security Team first (Cc-ed too) for their review, opinion and actions planned regarding the issues below? ( http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/security/ )  Also, are there relevant upstream bugzilla issue tracking system: [1]  records (where further information about the issues could be found) yet?  Thank you && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team  On AM, Mango wrote: > Hi. > I've found a bunch of vulnerabilities in the latest release of phpMyAdmin. > > Vuln 1: > Any variable in the super global $_SESSION array can be overwritten or > created with an arbitrate value. > > Vuln 2: > A (common) misconfiguration of phpMyAdmin allows content from the $_SESSION > array can be written to a .php-file. > Combined with Vuln 1 this becomes a conditional remote code execution. > > Vuln 3: > Content from the $_SESSION array are (post authentication) used as input to > a function that can execute PHP code. > Under the current circumstances a previously unknown null byte string > truncation in this function is used. > I have only been able to reproduce this string truncation on PHP > running on Windows 7 and I've failed to reproduce it on PHP running > on OpenBSD 4.7 and PHP running on Linux I do lack > the necessary C++ debugging skills to find out why this only works on my > windows box. > Combined with Vuln 1 this becomes an authenticated remote code execution. > > Vuln 4: > Under a certain configuration an authenticated attacker can include a local > file and interpret it's content as PHP. > By modifying values in the $_SESSION array a cache holding the required > configuration option can be temporarily altered during run time. > If combined with Vuln 1 all configurations are vulnerable to this > authenticated local file inclusion. > > > Vuln 2&  3 does not rely on Vuln 1 since the $_SESSION array could also be > modified by a local attacker trying to elevate his/hers privileges in an > improperly configured shared environment. > Do I need 4 CVEs? > > Regards > /Mango - ha.xxor.se >   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
