For example if I su to a normal user (not -c), I can keep the tty open. My point is it's not safe to do this.  >  > >I would classify this as an administration issue, not a flaw in su or > >sudo.

Things like su and sudo are designed to raise privileges, not lower them. If this isn't well documented, it should be.  In your situation, I would suggest using something like ssh with key authentication setup.  --      JB  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
