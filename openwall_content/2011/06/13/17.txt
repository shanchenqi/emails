I'm not really sure what to do.  The core issue, embedded null characters seems to be the same for both Java and Python, but the fix covers two different bits of code.  My guess is it's just one ID, but I'd like to be certain.  Thanks.  --      JB   ----- Original Message ----- > Hello, Josh, Steve, vendors, >  > A denial of service flaw was found in the way Python and Java > interfaces of libvoikko, a library for spellcheckers and hyphenators, > processed embedded null characters in input strings.
