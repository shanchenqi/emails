Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE request: kernel: alpha: fix several security issues  from Dan Rosenberg.  1. Signedness issue in osf_getdomainname allows copying out-of-bounds kernel memory to userland.  2. Signedness issue in osf_sysinfo allows copying large amounts of kernel memory to userland.  3. Typo (?) in osf_getsysinfo bounds minimum instead of maximum copy size, allowing copying large amounts of kernel memory to userland.  4. Usage of user pointer in osf_wait4 while under KERNEL_DS allows privilege escalation via writing return value of sys_wait4 to kernel memory.  I didn't investigate further.
