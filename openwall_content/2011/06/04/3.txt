This is very nice, thanks.  Many of the commits have Debian-specific info, though, which would be a bit distracting, and the Subjects are not specific (just "data/CVE" or "data/DSA"), yet this may be helpful.  I downloaded and grepped it for SSL (case-insensitive).  Didn't find the OpenSSL issue that started this thread.  This is not surprising: apparently, the issue did not receive a CVE ID in May, even though CERT published a Vulnerability Note on it.  > [0]http://lists.alioth.debian.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/secure-testing-commits > [1]svn://svn.debian.org/svn/secure-testing  Perhaps add these to http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/distro-patches#debian ? And, while you're at it, fix the many broken links currently in the Debian section there (I counted at least three broken links).
