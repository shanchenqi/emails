As a practical matter, you could follow the Debian secure-testing-commits mailing list [0] or check out the svn repo [1]. Updates to Mitre's CVE database are synced there twice a day.   Unfortunately, Mitre's databases pushes tend to have a couple day delay built in.  I've been intending to convert to the NVD database, which seems to get updated on exactly the disclosure date, but I haven't gotten around to that yet.
