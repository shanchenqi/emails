Customers have no clue of the vulnerabilities. Hosting providers always say marketing voice - easy deployment, one-click installation - but no security.  ###########################################################################  #1. Lack Of "install" directory removal check  This will allow attackers to overwrite existing config files with junk data, making the PHP Ticket application stop working. In extreme case, advanced attackers will inject valid php codes to do more harm.   #2. Hidden Debug paramter (tri_debug)  File: /include/config.php Code: 	// Conditional Error Reporting 	if (isset($_GET['tri_debug'])) { 		$set_ini = ini_set('display_errors', 1); 		error_reporting(E_ALL);  This will provide attackers every feedback for his attacking. For small case, this provides internal path disclosure. 	   #3. Addon: PHPMailer Remote Code Execution  PHP Support Ticket employed vulnerable version of PHPMailer class.  File: /classes/class.phpmailer.php Code: 	if ($this->Sender != "") 		$sendmail = sprintf("%s -oi -f %s -t", $this->Sendmail, $this->Sender); 	else 		$sendmail = sprintf("%s -oi -t", $this->Sendmail);   4. Possible Script Injection  A number of scripts use dangerous eval function without enough filtering. File: /classes/GUI/abstract.GUI.php Code: 	return eval('return PHPST_PAGENAME_' . strtoupper($this->page) . ';');  	  ###########################################################################   --------------------------------- Best regards, YGN Ethical Hacker Group Yangon, Myanmar http://yehg.net Our Lab | http://yehg.net/lab Our Directory | http://yehg.net/hwd  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
