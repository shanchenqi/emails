OVERVIEW  MyBB was vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting.   2. APPLICATION DESCRIPTION  MyBB is a free bulletin board system software package developed by the MyBB Group. It's supposed to be developed from XMB and DevBB bulletin board applications.   3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION  Two XSS vulnerabilities were found. One is user-driven XSS on "url" parameter. User will get xssed upon successful log-in. The other is a reflected XSS on "posthash" parameter where the valid tid (topic id) is required for successful attack. The anti-CSRF check against "my_post_key" parameter was not done in thread/post preview mode and thus there came a way for XSS to be successful.   4. VERSIONS AFFECTED  MyBB 1.6 and lower   5.
