I wanted to draw some attention to the fact that these applications, as well as setting up cronjobs to perform the same task, introduce the same risks as detailed in Tavis Ormandy's advisory for seunshare [1]. Namely, they make it such that the stickiness of /tmp can no longer be relied on.  Consider a setuid application that relies on the fact that users can't delete its resources in /tmp because they're root owned.  An attacker can simply launch the application and send a SIGSTOP at the right moment to cause it to sleep indefinitely, until tmpwatch (or similar) removes its /tmp resources, allowing them to be replaced by the attacker.  As Tavis pointed out, doing this with ksu could allow denial of service, but it may be possible to escalate privileges by leveraging other applications.  It seems like a difficult problem to solve - it's hardly feasible to rewrite every suid app that relies on the stickiness of /tmp. Hopefully we can generate some useful discussion here.
