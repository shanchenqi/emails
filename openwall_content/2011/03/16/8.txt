And of course it should be clearly indicated that the service is >available to the public; but *that* is what is for.  It should be noted that the UPnP feature is disabled by default, so the  user has the option to *enable* it. I concede that the string presented  in the UI needs improvement. Of course, I agree that indication of the  consequences would be appropriate, and also disallowing the 'none'  authentication method if UPnP is enabled.  --  http://amigadave.com/  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
