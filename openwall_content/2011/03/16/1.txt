The embargoes in vendor-sec were typically weeks, but I don't recall the longest one.  I too favor opening the vendor-sec archives after a while, maybe quarterly.  Not being the one fixing the code for our kernel left me with little to immediately contribute, but I requested and coordinated with several folks who got vendor sec for HP.  Likely, we would still want to be part of vendor-sec.new.  Most importantly, we would be glad to restate our need to continue to participate based on the new ground rules of whomever administers the new vendor-sec.  FWIW, I understand our largely silent participation in vendor-sec was annoying to folks looking at code, assessing risk, and suggesting fixes.  If there is something we could contribute, I'll encourage us not to be as shy.  -Mark Menkhus Hewlett Packard Software Security Response Team  > -----Original Message----- > From: Mike O'Connor [mailto:mjo@...o.mi.org] > Sent: Monday, March 14, PM > To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com > Subject: Re: [oss-security] Vendor-sec hosting and future of closed > lists >  > [catching up on older emails] >  > :> > They do this already today, that's what security@...nel.org is > for, and > :> > it gets a bit of traffic like this every week. > :> > :> Is this list open to the public?
