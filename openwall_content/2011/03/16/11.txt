Right. So that CVE should apply to the case of it listening on a publicly available IP address with no auth, whether it uses uPnP or not.  If it just listens on the socket and is usable from the outside world without a password, that's the *same* problem.  The CVE really has nothing to do with uPnP; it's about the lack of authentication on a publicly-available service.  --  dwmw2   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
