Claiming that the system is only reachable via local network while it's not doesn't sound correct to me either. However, how would a fix look like? A program basically can't know nor reliably determine whether it's reachable from outside. Private IP addresses are no indication either. So the only sane thing seems to be to not make any claims about local networks and just list the IP addresses/host names of the system.  cu Ludwig  --   (o_   Ludwig Nussel  //\  V_/_  http://www.suse.de/ SUSE LINUX Products GmbH, GF: Markus Rex, HRB (AG Nuernberg)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
