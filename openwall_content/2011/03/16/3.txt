There were some very long embargos when third parties reporting the issues  to vendor-sec requested delays (due to issues being actually in firmware  in one case, and due to closed-source vendor co-ordination in another).  And we did discuss things on the list that were never made public  (particular ways to test or exploit vulnerabilities).  Also there were  things reported to us by people that wished to get no credit and remain  anonymous when the issue was public.  However all those things are exceptions and I'd support us opening the  archives after a while and making it clear to folks reporting to us to  expect that to happen.  We'd need to check with common reporters like  CERT/CC who may not expect their early drafts to become public.
