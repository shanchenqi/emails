Likely, we would still want to be part of > vendor-sec.new.  Many of the kernel vulnerabilities I have seen over the past two years  at least, were reported and fixed upstream. Only a handful of them were  reported privately. I can't remember when was the last time we had a  kernel issue reported via vendor-sec. There were, but it must have been  quite some time ago. LKML is still one of the better places to find  vulnerabilities :) Contributions welcomed.
