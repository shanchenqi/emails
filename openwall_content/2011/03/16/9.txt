That's what uPnP is *for*.  Opening a port with uPnP, in a NAT-afflicted situation, is identical to binding to and listening on INADDR_ANY when you have real network connectivity. It's the moral equivalent to automatically using SOCKS to make outbound connections, if you're afflicted with a network that needs that.  There *is* an option to disable this feature, if the user really wants to. And of course it should be clearly indicated that the service is available to the public; but *that* is what is for.  There is also some merit in arguing that connections from outside the local network should not be permitted without a password. But again, there's nothing specific to uPnP in that.  --  David Woodhouse                            Open Source Technology Centre David.Woodhouse@...el.com                              Intel Corporation   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
