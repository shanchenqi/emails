I was under the impression the CVE id applied to instances where it would use UPnP and no auth, which is dangerous and should probably include a big warning with a button that says "I know what I'm doing (but probably not really)".  UPnP by itself is not a security flaw.  Sorry for the confusion.  --      JB  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
