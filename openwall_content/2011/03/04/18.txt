In which scenarios exactly logrotate is supposed to be safe to use is mostly undefined.  However, it is currently a common setup (as in: what distributions do out of the box) to have a daily logrotate cron job run as root that rotates the logs of all the services and to have log directories owned by service users (so they can create missing log files, for example).  In such setups, the service user can elevate its privileges to root or corrupt root-owned files using the various bugs.
