Actually, not so much.  Of the flaws we rated impact critical or with a  CVSS of 'high', only 4 were from that 29 from vendor-sec.  > I'm also curious what "issues already public but found out about it on > vendor-sec" means?  It's where the date the issue was public is the same date it was reported  to vendor-sec.  This can be because it was brought to the wrong list, the  embargo was a day or less, or less often vendors wanted to discuss  something about it confidentially (a way to exploit it, etc)  Mark  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
