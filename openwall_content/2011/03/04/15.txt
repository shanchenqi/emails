CVE number assignment: perspective from a small open source project  The MantisBT project (open source web based bug tracking) has been directly notifying major distributions of bugs which have a notable security impact. A project specific announcements mailing list, blog, bug tracker, IRC channel, Twitter account and source repository are also used to convey information to users about new releases. A number of notices were also sent to oss-security late last year in response to vulnerabilities being discovered.  The reason I bring up the long list of notification options is because of CVE number assignment. It strikes me that one of the key benefits of CVE numbers is to improve the ease at which a security issue can be tracked and information gathered via Internet search.  The time when a CVE number is arguably most useful is during the patch, release announcement and notification processes where it can be used to tie related information to a single tracking number. From the perspective of a small open source project, obtaining CVE numbers via oss-security appears to be a relatively slow process that can take a number of days to process. Furthermore, oss-security is probably one of the fastest methods (if not the only method) small open source projects can use to seek CVE numbers.   Why can't the project embargo the issue until a CVE number is assigned?  A large number of MantisBT users bypass their distribution packaging system to obtain the software directly (commonly the case for web applications). Other users do not have packaging systems available on their platform of choice (Windows or shared web hosting).  MantisBT has typically taken the full disclosure approach in the interests of providing the fastest possible response time to independent users. This involves applying a very obvious security patch in the repository, creating of a new release and loudly notifying users that they need to upgrade to the new minor release without delay for security reasons. This process currently occurs prior to a CVE number being allocated and as such our announcements, mailing list threads, commit messages, bug reports, etc generally miss out on being tagged with a CVE reference.  For a smaller niche/boutique distribution which MantisBT does not have the resources to contact for every vulnerability, they may hear about the issue first on oss-security. Their usual package maintainer subscribed to the MantisBT project announcement mailing list may be on holiday. That's OK though because the security team of the distribution may pick up on the news from oss-security (correct me if this use case is incorrect).  I would have thought that it'd be beneficial for the security team (and any other interested parties) to take a CVE number from the oss-security thread and perform an Internet search to bring up the maximum amount of information related to a vulnerability - Internet wide. The most important information is likely going to be from the open source project itself - announcements, mailing list threads, commit messages, IRC logs and bug reports. However blog posts, external mailing list threads, IRC logs, etc away from the official project communication channels may also be useful.   Suggestion  Is there a way open source projects can receive CVE numbers in a more timely fashion? Projects may go for entire years without a vulnerability and therefore pre-assignment may not be ideal. I suppose that is a downside of using an incremental integer numbering system. Perhaps some form of provisional CVE request functionality could exist for registered open source projects to call upon? Or an increased number of staff/volunteers within distributions who can assign CVE numbers via oss-security?
