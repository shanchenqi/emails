In general, that's what happens in CVE.  Part of this may be that as the  more obvious/severe issues get eliminated, less-severe issues are then  given more attention.  I try to watch out for edge cases that may  "snowball" into large numbers of CVEs of limited utility - and you brought  up one such example of a snowball issue with the recognition of  technically-unsafe-but-commonly-accepted file behaviors of various Unix  commands.  However, there is no clearly-defined line (software is too  complex and dynamic for that) and risk tolerance differs widely between  individuals.  The PHP interpreted gets hit with various issues related to  sandbox escaping (or an application attacking itself), but in a hosting  scenario (fairly common these days), it's a concern to some consumers.  As remote code execution vectors dry up (for certain classes of software),  people look elsewhere.  As obvious remote vuln types get resolved, people  look for other issues of uncertain exploitability that cause a crash.  Alexander, you've had a bit of experience in suddenly turning "bugs" into  "vulnerabilities" ;-)  The target is shifting over time and, by its  nature, spreading a wider net.  As long as prioritization metrics like  CVSS follow suit (e.g. more severities of 4 and 5, less 10's), this is a  reasonable shift.  For CVE, there is no implied requirement for vendors to post advisories  for evey issue that has a CVE assigned.  Vendors decide which issues are  severe enough to directly notify their consumers about.  Granted, as the  scope of CVE widens, this may increase the vendor workload.
