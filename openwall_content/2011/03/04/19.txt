And we need more info on #5.  For issue #5:  If the mail configuration directive is used, an attacker can trick logrotate into sending arbitrary files by mail, by creating appropriate hard or soft links.  Hope that's enough, let me know if not.

We don't mind documenting of this behavior in appropriate places.  Wouldn't like to condescend further into particulars, what is and what is not a security issue (as this is beyond this post), but according to our opinion even non-documented incorrect behavior, allowing malicious actions to be performed on the system, should be considered a security flaw (regardless if it's advertised or not). Because by applying your above approach, most of the open source project could just say 'this software is not intended to be run like that.'  Not trying to argue, just saying the disclination like the above doesn't help anyone.  Either the software has the issues, and they should be fixed, or it has the issues, and they can't be fixed. Then the software should not be used and an alternative one should be found.  This is not you would shoot yourself into the foot by accident (by performing some action). This is about local users', aware of the deficiencies, ability to conduct such actions on the system, so they would reach some higher privilege, damage or different kind of benefit for them.  Hope this helps.
