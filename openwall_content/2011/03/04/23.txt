While we try to respond within 48 business hours, unfortunately that  doesn't always happen.  But sometimes you get a response within 2 minutes  :-)  This year, I hope to improve our responsiveness with some internal  process improvements.  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
