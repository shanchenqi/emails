I've just skimmed over the list, and I only see one issue that I'd call a vulnerability in logrotate, issue #8.  And we need more info on #5.  The rest, as described, appear to rely on sysadmin error and to assume security properties that logrotate never advertised it had.  Specifically, logrotate was never declared to be safe to use on untrusted directories, and it was an error for a sysadmin to make such an assumption.  I don't mind logrotate being enhanced/hardened in this respect, but to call these vulnerabilities sounds like a stretch.  Also, even if logrotate is hardened, it should not be declared to be safe to use on untrusted directories.  It'd be better to explicitly state that it is not, to avoid this sort of confusion.  > 5) Issue #5: logrotate: Information disclosure by performing email >              notifications ... > 8) Issue #8: logrotate: TOCTOU race condition by creation of new files  > (between >              opening the file and moment, final permissions have been  >              applied) >              [information disclosure]  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
