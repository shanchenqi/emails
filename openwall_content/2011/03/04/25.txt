("blatant admin negligence" might be, say, if an admin arbitrarily makes a  script setuid, or modifies the perms for an executable or config file to  be world-writable.)  We will sometimes write the CVE description more as an "adminisrator  practice" than as "fault of the software."  For example, default passwords are fair game; arguably, if the admin  didn't read page 24 of the documentation that said "change the default  password," this is more the admin's fault than the software's fault... BUT  the issue has to be dealt with, either way, so a CVE becomes a "signal"  for that action to take place, whether it came from the software or from  the user.  Not everything is that clean and straightforward of course, but that's the  general thinking.  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
