That is the point of security@ list.  Many people on this very list asked for this type of alias years ago, so don't go and say that now you don't want it :)  > The goal here to is > bridge that communication gap - perhaps what's really needed is > allowing more representation on the existing list and clarifying and > encouraging policies for when CC'ing security@...nel.org is > appropriate, especially in regards to on-the-fence issues.

How can we be more open than we are today by showing you _all_ of the patches that we are deeming as "fixes"?  You want people to somehow magically categorize patches, and that's not going to happen because it's complicated and usually not known until after the fact.  Way after the fact.  So again, take a look at stable@...nel.org, it shows you all of these patches and you can start classifying them if you wish to.  thanks,  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
