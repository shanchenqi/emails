But this often requires  an understanding of the expected software behavior, and CVE covers  thousands of different applications each year.  Unfortunately, we can't  have that level of understanding about each app.  > It felt wrong, say, to blame a text editor for being unsafe to use on  > files in untrusted directories when such unsafety was the typical and  > expected situation for text editors in general.  Some items can be assigned a CVE without deep thought about the larger  context.  This may happen due to volume, time constraints, or an  under-specified attack scenario by the requester.  That may be the case  with the case you're talking about here, but I don't remember it.  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
