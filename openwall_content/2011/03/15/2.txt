You don't want that to be totally open, right?  One suggestion I've made in the past is to have the list _archives_ be open.  So anything older than, say, a month is made public.  That way, folks can see how issues were disclosed, how decisions were reached, etc.  for old issues that are no longer under embargo.  The way I see it, if we don't publish the list archive on our own terms, miscreants will get around to publishing it for us.    --   Michael J.
