I can see oCERT :helping in routing reports to the proper contacts via email to our trusted :member contacts as well as external ones that we can seek on a report basis.  What I've observed is that some times, the reporter or coordinator doesn't have a good idea of the scope of their issue.  To cite some real-world examples involving folks who I thought would know better:    1) no, BSD networking isn't just in Free/Net/OpenBSD    2) no, ONC RPC just isn't in Sun products   3) no, a RH-specific kernel issue is a general Linux kernel issue  Scoping issues isn't always easy.  How do you know whether I backported some bleeding-edge fix with broken security implications into one of the OSes I care about last week?  Sometimes, I'll need specific info just to confirm that I don't care about the issue.  Scoping is one of the things that vendor-sec was occasionally quite helpful with.    --   Michael J.
