The previous discussion was about possible attacks the kernel, now I'd like to talk about attacks userland programs.  While POSIX restricts the character set used in filenames, some Linux filesystems (at least ext2) permit reserved filenames ".", ".." and filenames with "/" inside.  I have a crafted flash drive with ext2 that has such files:  root@...atros:/media# ls cdrom/ -la итого 28 drwxr-xr-x 4 root root  . drwxr-xr-x 3 root root  .. drwxr-xr-x 3 root root  .. drwx------ 2 root root lost+found  root@...atros:/media# ls -la итого 28 drwxr-xr-x 4 root root  . drwxr-xr-x 4 root root  .. drwx------ 2 root root lost+found -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  lost+found/../../../etc/passwd  Guess what does "rm" with such filenames :-)  Another example of crafted fs is ext2 partition with EXT2_ERRORS_PANIC option set in superblock and corrupted root directory.  When run "ls" on the fs, the kernel would panic.  While it was said that such attacks have low impact, some systems already try to protect itself from untrusted external filesystems. E.g. automounting of flash drives in Ubuntu is processed with "-o nodev,nosuid".  I read this as external flash drives are not fully trusted and may contain some dangerous files.  If some automatic file processing of files on drives with specially crafted filenames is started then it might have a security impact.  I don't know such popular apps, though.  What I suggest is something like "-o untrusted" option to mount.  This would mean that the system considers the input from such fs as a malicious input.  Such mounted fs would try to consider the data on disk as untrusted and to be as robust as possible, e.g. check against "/"-filenames, against corrupted fs structures, etc.  I'd be happy to hear opinions about the usefulness of this feature.
