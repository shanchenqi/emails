I am releasing it under the GPL3 licence, and you can download it here:  http://www.econ.upenn.edu/~clausen/computing/libwipe.tar.gz  Any suggestions are appreciated.  In particular, I would like feedback on * which memory mappings should be erased on exit * which project this could be included in (secure-delete?)  OVERVIEW  This library is designed to make programs respect users' privacy by wiping information when it is no longer needed.  It does not require any modifications to the original programs.  To use it for all programs in a single shell session, set the LD_PRELOAD environment variable with the shell command          export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/lib/libwipe.so  To use it system-wide, add /usr/local/lib/libwipe.so to the /etc/ld.so.preload configure file.  The program uses two mechanisms: (1) when memory is deallocated with free(3), it is zeroed out. (2) when the process terminates, the entire memory is zeroed out.
