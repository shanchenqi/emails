Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> CC: oss-security <oss-security@...ts.openwall.com> Subject: CVE Request -- php-doctrine-Doctrine -- SQL injection flaw   Hello Steve, vendors,     a SQL injection flaw has been reported against Doctrine, the PHP Object Relational Mapper:    [1] http://www.doctrine-project.org/blog/doctrine-security-fix    [2]  Further from [1]: "The security hole was found today and affects the Doctrine\DBAL\Platforms\AbstractPlatform::modifyLimitQuery() function which does not cast input values for limit and offset to integer and allows malicious SQL to be executed if these parameters are passed into Doctrine 2 directly from request variables without previous cast to integer."  Could you allocate a CVE id for this?
