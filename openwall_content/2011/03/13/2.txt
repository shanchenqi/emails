The PHP security team has seen noticed, and a bug already was filed in the bugtracker [private])  $ sapi/cli/php ../bug.php array(1) { [0]=> string(5) "0Č y" } array(1) { [0]=> string(1) "0" }   Thanks.  --  Regards, Felipe Pena   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
