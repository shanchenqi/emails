Not sure it is fixable, or maybe using a lock on the symbolic link while fetching its target (to be tested to be sure that such locks cannot be overridden from shell).  > Also, I don't see a reason why a hard link couldn't be used for exploitation > instead.  Hard link are not detectable (lstat), they are treated like normal files.
