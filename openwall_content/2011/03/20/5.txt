It seems to me that while it's bad practice to create these interfaces as world-writable and should be fixed regardless, unless being able to write to one of these interfaces actually allows a user to do something he shouldn't be able to, it's not a security bug by itself.  For example, I've noticed interfaces that are created with world-writable file permissions that don't actually do anything useful when you write to them.
