In particular:  * util-linux mount should modify its custom addmntent function to behave as suggested in the glibc bug report, and should improve its error handling on addmntent failure to remove lockfiles and temporary files.  * If mount.cifs is still shipped by anyone as setuid (I know there was discussion of removing its suid bit), then it will need to be altered to edit a temp file instead of /etc/mtab directly and clean up on addmntent failure.  * If ncpfs is still supported by anyone (it's orphaned in a number of distributions), it should be fixed to have ncpmount edit a temp file instead of /etc/mtab directly and have both ncpmount and ncpumount clean up properly on addmntent failure.   Alternatively, I'd be happy to see mount.cifs and the ncpfs utils no longer ship with a suid bit, since they've had security issues in the past and I don't think there's many situations where unprivileged users need the ability to mount filesystems other than FUSE.  I'd also like to see distributions migrating away from /etc/mtab in general, since /proc/mounts seems like a much better replacement.  The above issues will probably need CVE identifiers of their own, but I'd hold off on assigning them until it's clear that glibc is amicable to the proposed solution.  Otherwise, there may need to be other fixes involving raising resource limits (I hope not).  -Dan  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
