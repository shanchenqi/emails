If  an emulator crash is considered a security issue, then and  are security fixes due to this.  I also don't know how you want to classify memory leaks (which in the  long run can cause an emulator crash). If a memory leak is considered a  security issue, then and are security fixes due to this.  and isn't part of your list) affect the  application's control flow, and should therefore according to Steven's  mail be considered security fixes. (The  branch has been merged to the dev branch multiple times. The commit  pointed to below fixes a harmless assertion bug, but the fix contains  more code.)  I don't consider a security fix. The functionality wasn't  working at all which was fixed.
