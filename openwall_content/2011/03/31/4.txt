I imagine that mount's -f (fake mount by editing mtab) and -n (mount  without editing mtab) options are not going to work if /etc/mtab becomes  a symbolic link to /proc/mounts, so that's liable to break a few things.    In the long run it does seem like a good plan, but there might be a  few bumps in the road.  I wonder what the rationale was for faking mtab  mounts in the first place?
