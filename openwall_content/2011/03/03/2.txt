Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: kernel: rds: prevent BUG_ON triggering on congestion  map updates  This was discovered internally when testing   "Tracked it down to a flaw in the xmit methods for the loop and ib  transports. Those two transports, when called with an rds message that  has the RDS_FLAG_CONG_BITMAP set, execute a rds_cong_map_updated call  and return.  Since the xmit method requires that the number of bytes  sent be returned, and a congestion map update doesn't really send any  data, it just returns the sizeof an rds_header plus the defined size of  the congestion map.  This is problematic because the caller of these  methods (rds_send_xmit), validates that we didn't send more data than  was available in the passed rds_message.  If the return value from  ->xmit() is larger than the remaining data in the message, we bug halt,  which is exactly what we get above.  We could add a check to skip the  bug on check if the RDS_FLAG_CONG_BITMAP flag is set, but I think the  check is otherwise valid, so I've fixed it with this patch, which limits  the return value in the effected transports to not be more than the  remainig space in the rds_message."
