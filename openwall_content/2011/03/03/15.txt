My current proposal is: split into several sub-lists.  I'd start with three: Linux vendors, *BSD vendors, security "researchers".  The vendor groups would be for externally submitted reports (by non-members) and for cross-vendor discussions.  The Linux vendors group should include distro vendors.  I am unsure whether it should also include Linux kernel-only folks or not.  Maybe we should be CC'ing security@k.o on relevant messages instead, or maybe we need a separate group for Linux distros+kernel.  It feels wrong to expose userland-only issues to the kernel-only folks.  The researchers group would (probably) rarely receive external reports directly, but could be involved in Linux and/or *BSD vendors discussions by CC'ing them when their expertise is needed.  Alternatively, the researchers may be included on the vendor lists, which will enable and encourage them to contribute a lot more, but then we need to define some stricter requirements for them (some minimum activity level?)  We don't want a lot of inactive members on any of these private lists.  As to projects such as, say, Samba and X.org, I'd exclude them. There's no difficulty for a researcher to notify one of these directly, and there's not much difficulty in CC'ing the proper one of these on a discussion.  > - Or of course the old option is open: >   Should we proceed with the current state as-is,  Probably not, although we could do it temporarily if there's a need - such as to continue some discussions that are already started.  > but throw a bit more GPG encryption on top?  I think we should have the new list(s), if we do set them up, GPG-encrypting to the members.  They should also accept encrypted messages (to the list's key).  This will reduce the likelihood of leaks somewhat - from the members' mail servers, from their unattended mailboxes, etc.  That said, leaks would nevertheless be quite likely - or at least we should assume so.  For this reason, I think these lists should be used for medium severity issues only, and CRDs should be set not too far into the future (say, up to 2 weeks, with an attempt to make embargoes shorter than that whenever possible).  Anything low severity is best made public right away - such as via oss-security.  Anything high severity may need to be approached more carefully, identifying just the affected distro vendors before initial notification by the reporter (then these lists won't be needed).  Of course, not everyone is willing to do that...  If we do receive a high severity issue notification via one of the "expander" lists, we'd need to apply an even shorter embargo period.  I'd appreciate any comments on the above.  Thanks again,  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
