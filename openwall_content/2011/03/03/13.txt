As an outsider with limited visibility into vendor-sec, this would be my  impression too.  I would imagine that things like major protocol design  flaws or critical, hard-to-fix bugs in popular software would still need  coordination across multiple parties with a need for non-disclosure for a  relatively long period of time.  Maybe vendor-sec-2 could handle that  need.  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
