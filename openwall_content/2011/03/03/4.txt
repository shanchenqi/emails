Mark J Cox has some stats for Redhat updates showing this.  We monitor how we first found out about every issue we eventually fix, and  if we found out before or after the issue was public.  For vendor-sec, during last calendar years  date		# issues in advance		# issues already public  That 29 represents just 4% of the total number of our vulnerabilities  fixed in  The median time of embargo for those 29 issues was 15 days  (average 24)  But I think that trend is what was expected, as upstream projects  communicate with affected vendors directly, and we use oss-security for  issues that don't need embargo or co-ordination.
