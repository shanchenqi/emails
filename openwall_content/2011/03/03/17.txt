I personally don't have the time to, I am swamped with just getting the stable updates out in a semi-timely fashion.  Digging through every patch in these releases and properly conveying the real, or percieved reason why they are needed, is a lot of thankless work.  Jon at lwn.net tried it for just one release, and we are averaging about one a week (total number of kernels released that is).  No one else has yet tried to do that, but if they will, I will be _glad_ to point my release notifications at that summary.  So in other words, help is gladly accepted :)  thanks,  greg k-h  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
