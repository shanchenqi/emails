Does that match your records? (Ubuntu doesn't currently track the origin of flaws beyond giving credit, so I'm curious if RH's data matches my sense of critical flaw origin.)  I'm also curious what "issues already public but found out about it on vendor-sec" means? Does that mean it was inappropriately brought to vendor-sec after it was already public, or that RH found out about it after it was public even though it had already been discussed privately on vendor-sec?  > But I think that trend is what was expected, as upstream projects > communicate with affected vendors directly, and we use oss-security > for issues that don't need embargo or co-ordination.  Several upstreams, though disappointingly not the Linux kernel, are very good about keeping their end-users in mind and providing direct distro coordination for important security updates (MIT Kerberos comes to mind first as a great example). This number of upstreams has been growing, but it's not nearly large enough to supplant a vendor-sec-like mailing list, IMO.  I'm all for the public disclosure of things that are low priority. But I think it's important to maintain coordination for really nasty flaws, otherwise we're in a position to really do a disservice to end-users.  -Kees  --  Kees Cook Ubuntu Security Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
