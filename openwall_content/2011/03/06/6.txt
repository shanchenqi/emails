I mean we shouldn't sweep the logrotate issues under the carpet, even if logrotate wasn't suppose to handle such use cases initially. I have an impression that's what you suggest. I mean this:  > The rest, as described, appear to rely on sysadmin error and to assume > security properties that logrotate never advertised it had.  and  > Indeed.  A vulnerability in the service package, in my opinion.

So I think all the logrotate issues should get their CVEs with an advise to work around misuse cases by chowning the log directories root:root.  The Gentoo issues, I think they don't need CVEs and will be fixed by the Gentoo security team (they are aware). The point was to show the misuse cases are common.
