Following glibc upstream and gentoo bug reports describe a bug in the way locale command escapes its output.   Gentoo bug points out possible security implications.  I've not managed to find an example where the locale command is used in a problematic way and where this may cross trust boundaries, so I wonder if this is worth handling as security fix vs. security enhancement.  Comments are welcome.  The issue was fixed in GLSA but its text really only mentions Tavis' issues.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
