Don't worry, it's harmless and already fixed upstreamยน. However, it turned out that udisks has a dbus method that by default allows the user on the active console to run fsck on removable media. fsck is run as root in this case. I haven't checked whether fsck is run automatically in any environment. However, since some desktops automatically mount removeable media it seems logical to call fsck first. So overflows in the various fsck binaries could allow local privilege escalation.  cu Ludwig  [1]  --   (o_   Ludwig Nussel  //\  V_/_  http://www.suse.de/ SUSE LINUX Products GmbH, GF: Markus Rex, HRB (AG Nuernberg)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
