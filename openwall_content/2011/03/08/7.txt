Upstream does not seem to consider this to be an issue:    Debian also uses the patch similar to what ldv pointed out - it changes ldd to always do:    LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS=1 /lib/ld-linux.so.2 /path/to/ELF-lib-or-binary  rather than:    LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS=1 /path/to/ELF-lib-or-binary  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
