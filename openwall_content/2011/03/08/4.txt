Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE request: kernel: dccp: fix oops on Reset after close   "This fixes a bug in the order of dccp_rcv_state_process() that still  permitted reception even after closing the socket. A Reset after close  thus causes a NULL pointer dereference by not preventing operations on  an already torn-down socket."
