I guess I do not see the reason for such a listing.  The list  that Josh put together from memory does not include the  distributions I represented and coordinated vendor-sec matters  for.  Having such a list just offers better target  identification of those NOT on the list and thus may lag a  CRD, no?

I do favor this a bit, as it would make > a nice compliment to oss-security  I favor such as well - I posted an offer to host such pro bono  as a neutral vendor (centos inherently trails), but it was  caught up in the trashing of the old vendor-sec host and so  did not ever pass the old list.  Openwall's offer is fine by  me as well.   I mentioned adding opportunistic SSL/TLS  transport on the mailserver, to cut out casual MitM  eavesdropping  > 1) Membership management is a pain.

Absent a charter to somehow mandate some  'contribution' to remain on a list, there is not a clear rule  to 'weed' the list.  But is this really needed except from  some idea of avoiding 'too many eyes'?  Frankly running a  distribution is work and for non-commercial distributions,  unpaid work  If a criteria for remaining on the list is needed, it is  needed to make sure that eyes are still reading the content --  handle that with a periodic 'tracer' piece, and drop  non-responders  -- Russ herrold  	(centos, cAos)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
