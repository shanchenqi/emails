I guess that is the most likely vector - how often did you download ISO images  from somewhere - it is often for me?  How often did you get USB drives from somebody - it happens frequently?  How often did you mount them?  I guess, this happened often. The concern here is that most users are very  unsuspecting of the discussed issue. Most people think that you should not  execute files from unknown media. But hardly anyone thinks that simply  mounting the media or listing directory contents would cause problems. At  least that is what I have learned.  Ciao Stephan  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
