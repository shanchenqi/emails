Is there by any >chance upstream patch for the bug [3] yet?  I only took over the Vino maintainership 10 days ago, so I am not  familiar with all parts of the code yet, including this one. Now that I  have been notified of the issue, I will work on fixing it, but for the  next stable release (GNOME 3.0), due in a few weeks, I think that it  will be safest to disable this functionality.  As for the UPnP issue listed at [2], I was planning to fix this during  the GNOME 3.2 release cycle, as it will require changing translatable  strings, and the project is already in a string freeze. The upstream bug  has some more details:   I could also disable this functionality as a workaround.  >Thanks && Regards, Jan.  --  http://amigadave.com/  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
