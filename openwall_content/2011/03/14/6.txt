I completely second your concerns.  However, how do you propose to implement that "untrusted" option? The core  problem IMHO is that the physical layout and structure in a file system is  assumed to be correct in general by the kernel. The physical file system  implementations (including any depending code, like the LSMs for interpreting  XATTRs) have some checks for an input validation. But I highly doubt that all  checks necessary for an untrusted file system layout are implemented - to have  all such checks would cause some speed penalties nobody wants to carry.  For example, the more sophisticated physical file systems (ext3/4, btrfs or  xfs come to mind) use pointers to the different blocks/extends. Is it really  ensured that misalignment of these pointers cannot cause adverse consequences  - at least crash the system?  Therefore, if you consider a file system untrusted, a simple flag "untrusted"  which disables some high-level logic (like symlinks across partitions or funky  file names) may just be window-dressing until the entire parsing of the  physical data structure layout is hardened.
