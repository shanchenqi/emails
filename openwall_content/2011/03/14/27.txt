I'd concur with the former, but not the latter. Issuing a CVE for that kind of thing just encourages the people who mistakenly view NAT as a form of security. uPnP is just one of the *many* reasons that viewpoint is wrong.  If you wouldn't issue a CVE for vino listening with socket() and bind() system calls, then you shouldn't issue a CVE for it using uPnP to listen either. uPnP is just the normal way to work around broken networking.  As far as I'm concerned there is only one issue here; the misreporting that only local access is possible when in fact it's not.  --  David Woodhouse                            Open Source Technology Centre David.Woodhouse@...el.com                              Intel Corporation   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
