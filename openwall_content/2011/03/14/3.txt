My (limited) understanding of GPL3 is that something like LD_PRELOAD usage would be more or less unrestricted.  On the other hand, I guess this is an unclear legal issue, and releasing under the LGPL would be adequate for my goal of requiring improvements to the library to be free.  How does this sound?
