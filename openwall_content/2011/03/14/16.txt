So, I think the first step is to patch glibc to return success in these functions if and only if the *full* contents have been written. Then, it will be possible to have proper error handling in these helper utilities.  Currently, there's really no way for these programs to know whether or not their calls to addmntent() actually succeeded besides installing a special signal handler for SIGXFSZ (ugly).  After some further thinking and discussion, I think what needs to be done is ensuring that all helpers make mtab edits to a temporary file, and have proper error handling that cleans up correctly without copying over to the actual /etc/mtab if anything bad happens. Currently, some mount helpers edit /etc/mtab directly, and others use a temporary file but don't have the proper error handling.  I think this one's going to fall into the hands of package maintainers and distros, I don't have time to fix all of these.  -Dan  On Mon, Mar 14, at AM, Dan Rosenberg <dan.j.rosenberg@...il.com> wrote: > Sigh.  Unfortunately I think this is the truth - I just wish there > were an easier way of addressing this besides patching every affected > helper individually.  Unless anyone else has any ideas, I'll write up > some patches for affected programs later today. > > -Dan > > On Mon, Mar 14, at AM, Ludwig Nussel <ludwig.nussel@...e.de> wrote: >> Dan Rosenberg wrote: >>> There are a few possible options   We could patch glibc to try to >>> raise the rlimit in addmntent().
