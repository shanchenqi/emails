As this is issue slightly on the border, not sure it should receive a CVE identifier, so Cc-ed David Woodhouse to elaborate more on issue impact if necessary.  Under my opinion, the trust boundary is crossed (it is wrongly reported to the the user, they have a secure setup, when they do not have it and otherwise would perform steps to correct the settings). But left the final decision for further discussion.  What are the thoughts of the others? Should this one get a CVE identifier or not?  Upstream bug report: [3]  Ubuntu bug report (IPv6 specific): [4]  To David King -- David, what are the upstream plans for this issue? Is there by any chance upstream patch for the bug [3] yet?
