Having many sub-lists will make this overly complicated. I think it is  more effective to have just one mailing list like before that everyone  can remember.  > The Linux vendors group should include distro vendors.

Do bear in mind  that any information shared with this list will have no CRD, and will be  fixed almost immediately (well, most of the time).  >> - Or of course the old option is open: >>    Should we proceed with the current state as-is, > > Probably not, although we could do it temporarily if there's a need - > such as to continue some discussions that are already started. > >> but throw a bit more GPG encryption on top? > > I think we should have the new list(s), if we do set them up, > GPG-encrypting to the members.

Even if we were to use GPG, we should assume that the reports will be  leaked anyway. One way as SD has mentioned is to use a short CRD.  Another way is to perhaps change our approach of informing issues:-  If there is an issue that we will need to co-ordinate with the rest of  the vendors, we will inform everyone with a very brief description of  the vulnerability. Just enough to find out if you are affected, but not  enough to actually pin-point the exact issue. And if you want to find  out more about it, email the vendor directly. This way, we will know who  we shared the information to, and if there is a leak, we can narrow it  down easily. All email conversations should be encrypted at all times.  The only exception to this is when we receive reports from third-party  researchers. This is the time we should use a short embargo.  > Anything low severity is best made public right away - such as via > oss-security.

Agree. We have been doing that for kernel issues. By making low severity  issues public right away makes dealing with updates easier.
