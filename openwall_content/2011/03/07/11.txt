Here is what I plan to do with CVE ids unless someone speaks up.  As best as I can tell, logrotate only needs a CVE id for this:      8) Issue #8: logrotate: TOCTOU race condition by creation of new files        (between opening the file and moment, final permissions have been        applied) [information disclosure]          It was found that logrotate utility used insecure default         permissions, when creating of new files (time-of-check,         time-of-use, TOCTOU race condition).  In some specific         configurations, a local attacker could use this flaw to open the         new file before the final permissions have been applied, leading to         disclosure of sensitive information. A different vulnerability         than:         [1] (Issue #1)          References:         [14]          Source code background (issue reason):         [15]  We then will need to assign IDs for various broken uses of /var/log (If someone has a list of the currently known ones, please pass it along)  What does everyone think?
