As Josh pointed out we do this already (even if manually and not with a web selection thing or whatever) and I am open to explore ways to create more cooperation.  We would also be willing to host and maintain a closed vendor-sec style mailing list like the previous one with the only condition for member list to be public (not necessarily the individual contact names but at least the entities represented).
