I don't know what this means for CVE id assignment per the > current "rules".  I was thinking more in the direction of an existing config that includes a wildcard and software that uses user input to construct file names that would be matched by that wildcard. An example of such software would be samba, which tends to create per-client-host log files named after those hosts. I don't have a clue whether samba could be made to include any shell meta characters (does it even do reverse lookups for that?), but I guess you get the idea.
