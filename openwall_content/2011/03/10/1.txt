The PAM module will erroneously return a success code when the user cannot be found in LDAP. Exploitability depends on the details of the PAM configuration but on systems that don't use the minimum_uid PAM option it may be possible to log in to any local account, including root.  This problem only affects the development release of nss-pam-ldapd. Earlier releases are not affected.  This problem has been assigned  More details are available at:  Affected users are advised to apply the attached patch, upgrade to (which will be released shortly), downgrade to or disable nss-pam-ldapd's PAM module.  --  -- arthur - arthur@...hurdejong.org - http://arthurdejong.org --  View attachment of type "text/x-patch" bytes)  Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
