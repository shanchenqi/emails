What about these?:  | However, I think that still #6 (shell injection) and #7 (logrotate | DoS with strange characters in file names) should be considered | vulnerabilities in logrotate: It would be reasonable to assume that you | can use user input that's a valid (slash-less) filename as a (part of a) | log file name (assuming that the program is running as the same user that | inspects and rotates the logs, so the log directory being writable by | the program would not be insecure per-se) without that file name being | interpreted by a shell or causing logrotate to stop functioning, | respectively.
