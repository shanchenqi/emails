But since not sure, which of those are real security flaws and how many CVE ids will be needed for those, Cc-ing also Erlang upstream developers to shed more light into this.  The distribution of OTPs is as follows: ======================================= Rickard Green:          Bjorn-Egil Dahlberg:    Sverker Eriksson:       Patrik Nyblom:          Raimo Niskanen:         Bjorn Gustavsson:       Niclas Axelsson:        Hans Bolinder:           Rickard, Bjorn-Egil, Sverker, Patrik, Raimo, Bjorn, Niclas, Hans, could you please have a look at the attached review file and reply which of the #20 OTPs in the list are security flaws (so we would know the count of CVE identifiers needed) and which are just bugs? (since you know the Erlang code better than me)  Help / guidance from your side is really appreciated to resolve this one.  Thank you in advance for your time and cooperation.
