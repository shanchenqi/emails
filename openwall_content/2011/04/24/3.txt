(These are some of the eligibility criteria for the initial seed membership of the new list.  The requirement "was a vendor-sec member" is likely to be lifted after a while.)  All -  The moderators of oss-security approved all subscription requests and criticism to be posted to this thread so far, but perhaps it's time to start rejecting unjustified requests to keep the noise down, asking the senders to re-post with due justification included.  This is what we will likely start doing should more requests without justification be sent to the list address.  I don't view this as censorship; it's merely getting people to include all info in one message, which reduces noise.  This doesn't apply to messages with criticism and/or suggestions, which we will continue to approve.  I am pleased to see that this thread is calming down, letting us focus on discussing actual software security issues (in other/new threads). Although the thread was/is noisy, I think it also helped us highlight several real issues, some of which we don't have good solutions for.
