BTW, people eligible and wishing to join the list don't have to post the specific e-mail addresses and PGP key info in here.  As I wrote in:   "That said, I agree that having specific e-mail addresses and key IDs posted to a public list is excessive.  If anyone else wishes to join (and qualifies), please state so in the "Closed list" thread and justify your request (currently that would mean info on the Linux distro you're a security contact for), then e-mail the specific e-mail address and PGP key info to me off-list.  I'll continue to reply on the list, but the specific e-mail addresses and keys will be exposed a little bit less."  Of course, for active participants of oss-security and/or other public lists this shouldn't matter much (they're "exposed" anyway).
