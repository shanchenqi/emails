Even if you can work around this, you'd have a race window of about two instructions, with basically no possibility of being preempted since there's no blocking or potentially faulting operation.  And that's assuming it's even possible, since it may be the case that this index is in a register, which would render this completely unexploitable.  Assuming this isn't the case, and you're running an SMP system and spent countless hours (days? weeks?) spinning to hit this extremely narrow race, you then get to write a single byte past the end of this array, into the vfd_is_open integer, which is already set to 1 (it's treated as a boolean value).  Even if due to magical powers you manage to hit the race window simultaneously on four cores (and the assembly works perfectly in your favor), you still don't achieve anything. :p  But it'll get a CVE anyways, so I'm not sure what my point is. :)  -Dan  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
