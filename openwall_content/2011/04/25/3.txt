Google certainly fits into this category these days with things like Andriod and Chrome (both browser and OS).  I've been contacted by some Andriod folks in the past. They're keen to start doing public advisories, most other Google projects already do this.  I suspect the real problem we'll hit with someone like Google is who to subscribe. We could easily end up with hundreds of requests from a company that size.  Thanks.  --      JB  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
