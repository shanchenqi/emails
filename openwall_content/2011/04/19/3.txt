A local attacker could use this flaw to conduct symlink > attacks (e.g. overwrite arbitrary system files).  Looked more into this issue and seems it may not be possible to misuse this issue. The steps are below:  tmp]# mkdir /etc/hello tmp]# ln -s /etc/hello atop.d tmp]# service atop start Starting atop: [  OK  ]  But atop detects the /tmp/atop.d directory already exists (/var/log/atop/atop.log contains): warning: no process exit detection (can not create directory /tmp/atop.d)  So doesn't seem to be exploitable => taking the CVE request back, no CVE needed.  Should have checked this earlier, sorry for the noise.
