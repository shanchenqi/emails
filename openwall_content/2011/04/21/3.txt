Would you reconsider and allow us on the list?    In an earlier mail, you mentioned  "For just one vendor, we can be CC'ing you whenever appropriate, with no list needed." We ship a lot of open source software, and outside of Apple, very few people would be qualified to know whether or not we ship any given piece of OSS, especially since we sometimes add new projects to the next, unreleased version of Mac OS X.  Regarding the question of where to draw the line for allowing non-Linux distros to the table, I'd say we've earned our place by sending numerous internally discovered bugs to vendor-sec, as well as coordinating disclosure of open source projects like CUPS that we maintain.  We'd want both me and <Jeffrey Czerniak <jeffcz@...le.com> on the list, both using the PGP key found at https://www.apple.com/support/security/pgp/   --- Drew Yao Apple Product Security     On Apr 5, at AM, Solar Designer wrote:  > I wish we had this discussion for real a month ago, but apparently most > folks won't comment until the setup of a closed list becomes a reality. > So I think there was some use in setting it up even if we end up re-doing > or removing it, which is within consideration. ;-) >  > On Tue, Apr 05, at Vincent Danen wrote: >> A lot of userland stuff is shared between BSD and Linux, and probably >> some other operating systems.
