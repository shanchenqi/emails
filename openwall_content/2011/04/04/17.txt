I think your argument for this mailing list is that vulnerabilities need to be fixed before they're released to the greater public. While I can understand that, it seems ridiculous to parade yourselves around in public with a signup system that is akin to   >>Huh?  Now you're with "the other" group that accuses "us" of "hiding"?  Can I not be part of the group that thinks a public signup system for a mailing list that previously had the mail server owned due to the fact it was secret (showing interest in possibly owning users now that emails like mjo@...o.mi.org have been confirmed on the list) for a mailing list that is 'embargoed' when really it shouldn't be.  >>What is your opinion on making the list's archive public with a delay(when the corresponding security issues are already public)?  It would be better. In my opinion, delay would be 1-2 days. Vendor-sec (alternatives) should be a last resort in publishing issues, other projects don't get the same "privileges", and have to "make do" with oss-sec. If you really need such help 'co-ordinating' and fixing things, maybe you should have a policy to, release advisory/info first, then have a 'co-ordination' list.   >>Do you really think anyone is gaining new information by discovering >>that, say, a member of the security team for a major distro will be on >>this mailing list?  Such information seems pretty obvious to me.  Yes Dan, but now we have private email accounts as well (by people who apparently don't like to use vendor email addresses) that are also signed up to this, allowing targeting and easy identification of probably less secure infrastructure.   Excuse my "trolling" if some of this has already been covered, I'm up early (for me) and thus can be slightly unintelligible.
