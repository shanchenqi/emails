Right.  We're likely to specify some minimum requirements.  For example, Mike's RSA key won't be allowed.  (It is OK for testing, but not when we use the list for real.  Yet this is an improvement over the plaintext vendor-sec and plaintext CC lists anyway.)  Maybe storage of private keys on a server won't be allowed (but we'd have to trust members on that).  > Perhaps all discussions should be published in the open > something like 2 months after the initial posting?

Technically, an archive may be implemented as yet another subscriber with its public key, where the private key counterpart is not stored on any server and has a passphrase on it. Thus, a possible compromise of the list server won't reveal past messages (archived before the compromise, but not yet made public).  Pushing the archive public will then be a manual process, but that's OK if it's only done once a month (omitting the last month's worth of messages).  In fact, a posting to oss-security will need to be made whenever the public archive is updated.  Comments on this are welcome.
