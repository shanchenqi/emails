This would require that the private key (to decrypt the archive) be stored on a server.  Then if the server is compromised, the intruder will gain access not only to new list traffic, but also to archived but not yet published postings.  Since the compromise _might_ be detected as soon as on the same day (it depends), this might make a lot of a difference (like, one day vs. one month worth of list traffic leaked).  > I think automatic publishing is the only way this is going to work. > No one is going to want to manually do the work.  I wouldn't mind running a script manually and entering a passphrase once a month.  Of course, the script would need to be prepared first, which I am not going to work on yet.
