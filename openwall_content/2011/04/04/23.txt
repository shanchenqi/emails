I'm not sure I have a helpful proposal, but closed security lists have always made me somewhat grumpy. Basically, it seems to me that there are two major problems with them:  1. People who "ought" to have the information don't, because they're not on the list.  2. People who "ought not" to have the information do, because they are on the list.  So my general inclination is to at least fix this problem for myself, by being on all the lists :-)  Yes, this doesn't fix problem 2 - so sorry: my general stance on this is that it is really impossible to say who "ought" and "ought not" to have security info. I hear all sorts of noises about vendors being in the "ought" camp and end users in the "ought not", but that makes no sense to me: vendors only "need" to be on the "ought" list because they're a roadblock between the software authors and the end user. They should just fix that problem. In any case, who is a "vendor". I build all my s/w from source, pretty much. Am I therefore a vendor (to myself)?  Alternatively, I "ought" to be on the list because history has shown that a) I can sometimes do something useful about the problem and b) I can be trusted with the information. Maybe that's a better way to run a list, I don't know.  > > The vendor-sec membership requirement was just for the initial seed > membership of the new list.  Its purpose is to ensure we're not making > things worse in terms of pre-CRD leaks, at least not right away. ;-) > > As you can see from another message I posted, I've only setup a > Linux distros list for now, which lets us side-step the issue of > comparing one security researcher vs. another for membership of that > list.  I'd be happy to setup a separate list with only security > researchers on it, and we can ask folks to CC that list whenever a > discussion on the Linux distros list is expected to significantly > benefit from participation of the researchers. > > I'd be happy if you have a better proposal. > > Thanks, > > Alexander >  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
