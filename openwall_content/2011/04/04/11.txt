So we have two representatives for Red Hat (Mark > and Josh).  Limiting a distro to two or three representatives is going to make things  tricky for Red Hat; we have a rather large dedicated security response  team (as we publish over advisories a year across 70 product/versions  and have a number of folks dealing with 'incoming' issues spread, and my  team is dispersed across 9 different countries).  If these representatives  have been very active on v-s and oss-security is there a reason to limit?
