I was thinking that only a subset of issues discussed on the list will be relevant to a given distro, and only a subset of those will need to be communicated to the distro's entire security team right away.  Maybe this is not true for large distros, which package almost all software that Linux distros package at all.  > That being said, my key data (I was added as part of Debian): > pub   >       Key fingerprint = FF46 5CC1 E2E5  7CFF > uid                  Nico Golde <nion@...ian.org> > uid                  Nico Golde <nico@...lde.de> > uid                  Nico Golde <nion@....net> > uid                  Nico Golde <nion@...tu-berlin.de> > sub   >  > or alternatively a stronger key: > pub   >       Key fingerprint = E1AB DE0E FFCA AEF3  CD4B 2AF3 A0A0 AAAA > uid                  Nico Golde <nion@...ian.org> > uid                  Nico Golde <nico@...lde.de> > uid                  Nico Golde <nion@...tu-berlin.de> > uid                  Nico Golde <nion@....net> > sub    Please suggest a specific e-mail address and key combination.  And if you suggest other than your @debian.org address, please suggest a way to verify that the address is really "yours" (the Debian security person's).
