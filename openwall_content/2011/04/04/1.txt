Such information seems pretty obvious to me.  Benji's trolling does raise a couple real issues.  The private keys and passphrases of those responding here have now become highly lucrative targets for attackers.  Hence, everyone on this new list needs to use good practices to keep their keys, hard drives, and computers safe. There should probably be some common guidelines for key safety for all participants.  A private period is rather unfortunate, and hopefully it hasn't been and isn't being used as a veil.  I for one am for full transparency (especially given Mark Cox's statistic that vendor-sec was only relevant for 29 out of over open source issues last year).  However, I recognize that there seems to be a need for some private coordination at present. Perhaps all discussions should be published in the open something like 2 months after the initial posting?  That would be a kind of maximum private coordination period.
