I'm not intending to request subscription to vendor-sec (I'm not yet really active in Debian security team) but considering the use of GPG, would it make sense to have at least some kind of âweb of trustâ thing on the involved keys? That plus subscribing the project address when possible could help maintaining some confidence about where the mail really ends (though that doesn't mean it can't be leaked later).  I'm not sure the procedure Debian use for cross-signing would fit because it involves physical meeting (and usually beer signing too) and it might not be practical, but it's still an idea.
