It's really no secret who is involved in open source security, or most any security in general. If you're in this business and don't worry about such threats all the time, you're probably in the wrong field.  I think keeping this wide open will make us better at what we do. This is a bit silly I agree, but it's also brutally honest.  I've often found that if nobody is complaining about what you're doing, you're not doing anything interesting.  At least I can keep telling myself this is interesting ;)  Thanks.  --      JB  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
