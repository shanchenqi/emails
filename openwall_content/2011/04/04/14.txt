Limiting that access to 2-3 people of the team would make that  approach a bit unpractical for us in terms of handling undisclosed issues. I also would welcome it if people who have been active on oss-sec and v-sec  before should be allowed back to this list.  I can understand that you want to keep the list of subscribers low in order to  prevent leaks. But from a practical point of view I see really no difference  if a mail is passed to a team exploder of a distro by one of the allowed  subscribers or directly sent to these members, at least in terms of attack  surface/leaking risks. The only practical difference I see is who would be responsible for such an incident. But if it's just about moving the responsibility out of the list itself to the vendor while keeping the number of subscribers low you could as well subscribe our team@ alias and encrypt mails with the team key.
