The patches fixes the code that was intended to clean up wipe certain buffers that were used to store crypto material before freeing them. As the CC on John was dropped, I guess he did not see your follow-up to clarify his "local".  My understanding is that this issue may increase impact of some other memory disclosure issue (encryption key leaked vs. e.g. a random chat message), but requires some other flaw to be an issue.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
