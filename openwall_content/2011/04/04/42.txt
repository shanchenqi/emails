Yes, I think folks are overestimating the value of the information that was on vendor-sec, and I am going to try to reduce that value even further for the new Linux distros list (such as by pushing discussions on non-medium severity issues elsewhere, and by limiting the embargo periods).  I think vendor-sec was primarily a target of attacks as a challenge, not so much for the value of the information that it actually carried.
