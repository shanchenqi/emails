Worse, people will also have the temptation to make use of the information at their other jobs, etc.  For example, a security contact for a distro might not only prepare updated packages, but also patch their personal server early... which adds to the risk.  I see no way to deal with this technically, other than by keeping the number of subscribers relatively low (only those who "need to know") and by only discussing medium-severity issues on the list (thus high severity ones will have even more focused distribution).  Arguably, medium-severity issues are not worth rubber-hose cryptanalysis and are not as tempting to patch, yet their handling may benefit from some coordination between distro vendors.  > Sometime ago I was taught that the best way to be sure a secret was not > known was not saying it, so if you, researchers, want to make sure your > PoC aren't abused do things properly, warn the vendors to upgrade the > product because of your security finding and avoid providing PoCs until > enough time has passed for you to be sure everybody has had a chance to > upgrade.  This makes sense to me.  No need to provide vendors with more info than they need to properly patch the issue and verify the fix.  The latter will sometimes require access to a PoC, though, but I'd prefer such PoCs to be sent directly to vendors who express interest in testing their fixes rather than posted to a multi-vendor exploder list.  > Any other solution can be easily flawed since you can't make sure I > won't buy/kidnap/kidnap relatives of/steal data from etc. on anybody on > such a private list.  Sure, but it's always a tradeoff, and the risk is there even if you share a vulnerability report without a PoC.
