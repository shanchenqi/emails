It appears that this is what we will have, but I am starting with one list that is more obviously needed (alternative to CC lists).  Your specific example re: "how to deal with vagaries in gcc vs. C standards with general security impact" would be best discussed on oss-security (that is, on a public list), though.  It does not benefit from a short embargo, and long embargoes are inappropriate.
