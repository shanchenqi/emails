Such information seems pretty obvious to me.  I think this thread is useful in the interest of transparency, which was sorely lacking with the previous incarnation of vendor-sec.  And with regards to enforcing embargoes for security issues, I'd think you would have better people to complain to a security community that tends to only enforce embargoes for days or occasionally weeks, and only for more serious issues, as opposed to the months or years that issues may go unfixed in the commercial software world.  While delaying security fixes unnecessarily is harmful to users, coordinating fixing over a short timeframe such that major distributions can release updates simultaneously seems like common sense, not "hiding being some sort of veil".  -Dan  > > On Solar Designer <solar@...nwall.com> wrote: >> Mike, >> >> On Fri, Apr 01, at Mike O'Connor wrote: >>> pub   >>>       Key fingerprint = 8F 85 89 E1 A2 FC EB D2  27 49 56 1E CC DF C9 >>>       C1 >>> uid                  Michael J.
