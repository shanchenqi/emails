Elliot - can you please post an URL with info on rPath Linux security response?  I went to http://www.rpath.com but could not easily find anything relevant.  There's an entry for rPath on the oss-security wiki:  http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/vendors#rpath-inc  It has a link to the security-announce mailing list.  The archive has a message in Feb ("kernel" update on and a message in Dec ("gnupg" update on  Nothing in Nov (but a bunch of updates in Oct).  This gives us two security updates in 5 most recent months.  Naturally, I am not convinced that you should be on the list, but I'd be happy to be convinced once we start using the list.
