Don't get me wrong, I have a lot of respect for you - in fact, in my sysadmin role, I am flattered that you'd want to be on a list I setup. I just think that you providing answers to the questions above will help the discussion.  I don't know what your answers would be (I can try to guess, but I might be wrong).  I do think that you might propose something we have not yet thought of.  The vendor-sec membership requirement was just for the initial seed membership of the new list.  Its purpose is to ensure we're not making things worse in terms of pre-CRD leaks, at least not right away. ;-)  As you can see from another message I posted, I've only setup a Linux distros list for now, which lets us side-step the issue of comparing one security researcher vs. another for membership of that list.  I'd be happy to setup a separate list with only security researchers on it, and we can ask folks to CC that list whenever a discussion on the Linux distros list is expected to significantly benefit from participation of the researchers.  I'd be happy if you have a better proposal.
