O'Connor <mjo@...o.mi.org>  I've subscribed you with this key for now, but you really ought to upgrade to a larger key, and I'd appreciate a statement on what Linux distro you represent on the new list.  All: my decision is based on some info known to me, but I'd prefer to base it on Mike's posting to oss-security.  I am saying this to explain that there's a reason why I subscribed Mike, whereas I would not subscribe another "random" person posting the same kind of message from a personal address. ;-)  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
