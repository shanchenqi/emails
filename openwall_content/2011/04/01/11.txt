Strictly limited to vendor coordination of embargoed security issues (with membership reflecting this purpose), or  2. Opened up to researchers who have contributed knowledge and findings in this area, and are deemed trustworthy by other list subscribers or some other community opinion.  In other words, it doesn't make sense to me to use "member of the old vendor-sec" as the only requirement for subscription, as some of the old members may not be eligible depending on the purpose of the new list.  I understand that this is just a preliminary solution, but I think the question of membership should be sorted out sooner rather than later.
