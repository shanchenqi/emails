Rather than let it slip away, I think we ::should go ahead with the simplest solution right now, we can always do ::something different at a future date. :: ::Openwall has graciously volunteered to run a new list, and they currently ::have some infrastructure in place to do this. The new list can start up ::right away. In this instance, I fear perfect is the enemy of the good. I'd ::rather see something functional in place than nothing. :: ::Here is the plan for initial membership (this is also approved by ::Openwall). :: ::Initial members will have had to be a vendor-sec member (no exploders this ::time around). You must reply to this thread, in public (on oss-security). ::We want this to be very public, we have nothing to hide. You must have a ::public gpg key ID included in your reply. The new list will gpg encrypt all ::mail (it does accept plaintext messages though). : :-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- : :8LMz3gjrgSXMOxuep/Ui :=elKt :-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----  pub          Key fingerprint = 8F 85 89 E1 A2 FC EB D2  27 49 56 1E CC DF C9       C1 uid                  Michael J.
