Here is my current view, I'm going to leave the final decision up to Solar Designer, I view this as Openwall's list.  We have rejected certain membership requests because they are not currently releasing security updates. I agree with this policy, I would say my initial mail was too vague. This instance is no different. It's clear that one of the membership requirements is now producing security updates.  If you can show you're doing this, that's grounds for membership in my opinion.  Thanks.  --      JB  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
