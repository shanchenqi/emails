Here :is my current view, I'm going to leave the final decision up to Solar :Designer, I view this as Openwall's list. : :We have rejected certain membership requests because they are not currently :releasing security updates. I agree with this policy, I would say my :initial mail was too vague. This instance is no different. It's clear that :one of the membership requirements is now producing security updates.  If :you can show you're doing this, that's grounds for membership in my :opinion.  Josh, I think in your quest to make things less vague, you may have actually made them more vague.  "security updates" and "public advisories" aren't the same thing, That's not just a semantic distinction.  There's many s vendors who release security updates, but not necessarily public advisories on them.  They may have constituencies that would simply get confused  by advisories, or they have auto-update mechanisms, or part of their support model involves pushing their customers to keep up with all fixes, security or otherwise.  They may simply thing that advisories are a waste of time because customers don't read.    For linux-distros, I think what you really want to go for here are *timely* updates.  If a distro isn't generally capable of producing a security update within, say, a month of when the issue was released, then their getting the issue in advance through linux-distros isn't going to do them or their distro community a lot of good because they have other constraints in getting fixes out the door.  Focusing on how you think an update ought to *look* (e.g. should the advisories be public?) isn't as important as the update getting *out*.  Especially since you're dealing with GPL'ed code, I think that's something you can measure.  Just ask the constituency a month or so after some major kernel issue who has released updates/fixes and who hasn't, show the relevant source, and take it from there.  Take it for what it's worth... -Mike  --   Michael J.
