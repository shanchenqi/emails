Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE request - kernel: bonding: Incorrect TX queue offset  Backport of upstream commit: bonding: Incorrect TX queue offset  By default bonding only allocates 16 queues. Devices that have more than  16 receive queues will exceed the tx queue index for the bonding device,  resulting in at least a denial of service (BUG: unable to handle kernel  paging request at...).  For proper queue allocation, in the bonding driver and down to the  devices, they should probably add the following line to one of the files  in /etc/modprobe.d/  options bonding tx_queues=N  where N>= number of processors that show up in /proc/cpuinfo.
