The second the advisory hits "the news" you have the patches ready for you customers. That's what I was trying to say. What Dan is pointing out as well is important here, I'm sure that only advisories for your own specific distri's and keeping those "in house" are providing your customers with a false sense of security. A clever sysadmin will be aware that a security fix for $distri will also mean that your software is affected. And an evil hacker will know this as well.  But I'm taking my ass out of this discussion. I'm not providing a Linux distribution, only part of the development team of an open source e-commerce solution with the luck of only having one security bug / CVE in the last 4 releases :P  Cheers,  Ronald  Batavi.org  > >It's not that this >> is so strange, as closed source OS makers are doing the same (remember >> Black Tuesday's at MS and Apple's releases). >>  >> Just my 2 cents. >>  >> Ronald  >> Batavi.org >>  >>> >>  >>     Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
