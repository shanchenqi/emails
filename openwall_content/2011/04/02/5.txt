GPG as most other cryptographic software is vulnerable to it. What about black-bag cryptanalysis?  Sometime ago I was taught that the best way to be sure a secret was not known was not saying it, so if you, researchers, want to make sure your PoC aren't abused do things properly, warn the vendors to upgrade the product because of your security finding and avoid providing PoCs until enough time has passed for you to be sure everybody has had a chance to upgrade.  Any other solution can be easily flawed since you can't make sure I won't buy/kidnap/kidnap relatives of/steal data from etc. on anybody on such a private list.
