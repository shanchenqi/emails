In fact, I think membership to such a list should be restricted almost exclusively to distributions and downstream providers of third-party software.  It obviously makes sense to have distro security teams on a list, since a vulnerability in project XYZ will need to be coordinated among all of the distros.  However, most software projects only need access to information concerning their own project.  There's no reason one software project should gain access to vulnerability information about a completely unrelated project, and restricting membership to achieve that will at least help minimize the leakage that went on with the previous list.  In a nutshell, I think this list needs to decide what its purpose is. If it's for coordination for vulnerability disclosure, then its membership should be kept to those who actually need to do the coordination.  If it's for private (or semi-private) discussion of potentially sensitive research, knowledge sharing, etc., then its membership should be expanded to include representation from software vendors and researchers.  -Dan  > > Thanks. > > -- > Â  Â JB >  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
