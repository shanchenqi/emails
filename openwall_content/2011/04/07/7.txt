[...] * Fixed critical bug causing Proxy-Authorization  header to be sent to the target host when tunneling requests through a  proxy server that requires authentication.    Contributed by Oleg Kalnichevski <olegk at apache.org>"  It doesn't look like this has received a CVE identifier and I didn't  want to duplicate anyone by assigning one from our pool.  Could someone  please assign one?  Thanks...  	-Chad  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
