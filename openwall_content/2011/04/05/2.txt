Hello Solar Designer,  We found the vendor-sec email list useful not just for reporting issues in open-source projects, but also for receiving advance notification about issues that affect the various open-source libraries and applications that Apple ships.  (More details can be found at http://www.opensource.apple.com/)  If you are not willing to grant us full membership to the new list, we at least hope we can be cc-ed on all userland issues reported to the list.
