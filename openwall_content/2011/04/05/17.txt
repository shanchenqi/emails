Note - we need different CVE's for the issues found by Dan  Hutchings versus those found by Dan Rosenberg.  Dan, could you confirm that this breakdown makes sense?  1) buffer overflows (not validating length is <= the maximum)  2) use of negative signed integers in memcpy() and other operations where     conversion creates a large unsigned integer, referred to as     "underflow"  3) any other types of problems that aren't covered by those two?  (The     length validation checks don't always have enough context in the source     code).  We would need separate CVE's for the issues found by Dan versus the issues  found by Ben Hutchings.  Arguably, #2 could probably be broken down further, but without enough  source code context in the patches, it's not immediately clear.  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
