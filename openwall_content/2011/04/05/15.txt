This is an excellent point. It's a hard problem to solve honestly. I guess the question really comes down to this. Do the disadvantages of one list outweigh the benefits? I'm not sure what the answer is. There probably isn't an "answer" though, just lots of opinions.  >  > > I'm starting to worry we've created rules for the sake of rules, which > > almost never has a net positive outcome. >  > What do you propose?

I guess at the end of the day it comes down to the projects and reporters. Thinking in this regard, I think there could be advantages to having multiple lists with people subscribed to the various groups they belong, then the projects and researchers decide how they want their information distributed.  This is why I like the idea of the membership list being public, it's makes it quite clear who would be receiving the information in question. We're really talking about a group that's a service to reporters, not the distributions or vendors. We want to make it easy for researchers and projects who approve of embargoes to work with us, and allow us to work with them in return.
