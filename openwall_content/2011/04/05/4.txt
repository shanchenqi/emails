This raises an interesting point, "downstream providers of third-party software".  In my case, I'd understand that I might want to offer vendors the possibility to co-ordinate upgrades for bogofilter, fetchmail, and leafnode, in lexicographical order, and possibly for a FreeBSD port -- although I'm not a representative of FreeBSD's security officer team (nor would that team usually deal with third-party software vulnerabilities unless it's in the basde system).  Questions:  #1 would the new private list be allowed to Cc: outside members (for instance, FreeBSD's unencrypted internal developers@ list does not allow that)?  Who would make sure that no end user agent allows an unencrypted Cc: slip?  A major concern IMO.  #2 will the subscriber list be public for subscribers that are later joining according to a policy that the new subscribers will have voted on in the secret list?  #3 will the list rules themselves be open to non-members?
