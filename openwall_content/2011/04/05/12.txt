Just a suggestion.  I'm afraid that we'll have to introduce something like this if/when we create a list not limited to Linux distros (and maybe sooner), but then we'll have the problem of it being an el8 list.  I think it will be an improvement over CC lists anyway, but many others appear to disagree.
