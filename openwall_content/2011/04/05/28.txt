So I think there was some use in setting it up even if we end up re-doing or removing it, which is within consideration. ;-)  On Tue, Apr 05, at Vincent Danen wrote: > A lot of userland stuff is shared between BSD and Linux, and probably > some other operating systems.

There are also userland tools specific to the Linux kernel, there's Linux-PAM, there are package managers that are rarely used on non-Linux.  I mostly agree with you, though.  > I think if the disqualifier to Apple is that they don't ship a Linux > kernel and glibc, then we're doing them (and ourselves) a disservice. > Apple contributed a lot to vendor-sec (and I'm not going all pro-Apple > here, just stating a fact).

Do we accept Solaris distros (of which there are several), Haiku, ReactOS, Cygwin, and who knows what else (no offense intended to any of these fine projects)?  I think this would make leaks and misuse of the information significantly more likely, and make some members and reporters uncomfortable about posting to the list.  So we'll be back to CC lists.  > ... letting Apple/FreeBSD/OpenBSD/etc. have a seat at our table.  I am comfortable about "Apple/FreeBSD/OpenBSD", but not about "etc." - so we'd be forced to introduce a vouching system (well, maybe we'd be forced to do that for Linux distros as well...)
