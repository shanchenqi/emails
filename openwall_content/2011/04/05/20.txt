Both FreeBSD and NetBSD have separate security teams that work to keep the third-party software provided by the FreeBSD ports system http://www.freebsd.org/ports/index.html and NetBSD pkgsrc system http://www.netbsd.org/docs/software/packages.html patched for vulnerabilities.  (Note that the pkgsrc system is cross platform and works on *BSD, Solaris, Linux and many other platforms.)  I'd guess other BSD and Solaris distro's have similar teams.  I'd like to either see members of these teams included, or a second list created for all issues not specific to linux.  (FWIW I am on the pkgsrc security team.)  I'll also second the question someone else posed about how cc'ing others off the list could reasonably work if all messages are encrypted.
