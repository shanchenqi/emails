O'Connor <mjo@...o.mi.org>  As discussed with Mike off-list, he does not currently qualify for the Linux distros list (he posted the subscription request above before I added that requirement), and a new PGP key would be needed anyway.  So I've just unsubscribed Mike.  He may qualify for a non-Linux list if we set one up.
