It doesn't matter *what* is public, just as long as something is (and it needs to be reasonable, expecting others to dig through source would be silly). If someone is untrustworthy and using a private list inappropriately, do you really think they're going to tell the truth if they're asked about releasing timely updates? Clearly advisories are the easiest way to verify this, but if someone has a better idea that includes verifiable information, please speak up.
