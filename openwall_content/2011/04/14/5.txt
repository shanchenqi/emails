A quick idea, rather than a real guidance:  Several vendors offer some sort of public CVE database that can be used to search for vendor's updates to address particular flaw.  If you're already tagging your updates with CVE ids, this may not be hard to provide.  Not because folks on this list ask you to do so, but because it's likely to provide a significant benefit to your customers with little extra cost/effort on top of what you already do.  SUSE's database is probably closest to what may work for you as well. CVE info is split by a patched product+version, with links to customer-only download site for the enterprise products.  http://support.novell.com/security/cve/  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
