The first one is (bug at  fixed in Thunar and triggers when creating file from templates and calling it with a format string.  The second is and is triggered when copy/pasting a file named from a format string. There's no released version including the fix right now.  I've triggered the (second) bug using file named %s or %n but didn't really manage to exploit it (it crashes just fine).  I'm not so sure it really needs a CVE so it's a request for discussion as well :)  As a side note, I do use -Wformat -Wformat-security -Werror=format-security (thanks to hardening-includes) for my Debian builds, but as those function are wrappers of wrappers of wrappers to printf() and stuff like that, -Wformat-security won't help. Is there a way to work around that?
