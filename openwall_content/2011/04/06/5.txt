[...]  Probably worth pointing out, since I didn't see it mentioned elsewhere, that these distinctions are not so cut-and-dried as that. Debian, for example, is not only a GNU/Linux distribution but also a GNU/BSD distribution:  http://www.debian.org/ports/kfreebsd-gnu/  (...and a GNU/Hurd distribution, though perpetually short of release status, and it's not like there are likely enough of those to warrant a separate ML of this nature anyway.) --  { IRL(Jeremy_Stanley); WWW(http://fungi.yuggoth.org/); WHOIS(STANL3-ARIN); SMTP(fungi@...goth.org); FINGER(fungi@...goth.org); IRC(fungi@....yuggoth.org#ccl); YAHOO(crawlingchaoslabs); AIM(dreadazathoth); }  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
