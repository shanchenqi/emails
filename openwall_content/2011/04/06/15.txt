The dhcpd(8) manual page: [6] http://linux.die.net/man/8/dhcpd  suggests it's possible to "The control object allows you to shut the server down." [the Control Object section], but it also states:  "OMAPI clients connect to the server using TCP/IP, authenticate, and can then examine the server's current status and make changes to it."  and  "The DHCP server exports the following objects: lease, host, failover-state and group."  so not sure, if any (unprivileged) OMAPI client could shut down the server.  Hopefully Jiri / someone else more familiar with OMAPI feature could shed more light into this (if each OMAPI client is able to shut down the dhcpd server => just bug or just privileged / authenticated one => potential DoS).
