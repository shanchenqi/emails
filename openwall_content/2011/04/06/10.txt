A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause denial of service (excessive CPU use and dhcpd daemon unreachability).  References: [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]  Note: Though looks as minor / low severity issue, under proper configuration        looks to be a way, how to get dhcpd completely unresponsive for further        requests.  Could you allocate a CVE id for this? (though opened for discussion if this being more to be a bug, than a real security issue).
