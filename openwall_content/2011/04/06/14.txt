The first 3 issues were reported to the Mono team by Jeroen Frijters (http://www.ikvm.net/).  The fixed versions is for the 2.4 branch and for the (Moonlight 4 preview) branch.  The main Novell tracker bug for this update:   modification of read-only values via RuntimeHelpers.InitializeArray  The modification of read-only variables (e.g. from outside the sandbox) could be used for breaking out of the moonlight sandboxing.   buffer overflow due to race condition in in Array.FastCopy  Similar to the above, an array element could be changed to a privileged read-only element which would then be overwritten. (So not a lowlevel buffer overflow, but a sandboxing violation/break out.)    use-after-free due to DynamicMethod resurrection   Also fixed in this update: information leak due to improper thread finalization  Ciao, Marcus  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
