I'll try to clarify it :  - was affected to the Webkit bug by Josh Bressers on May 9 (via oss-security and the private ticket). It seems to me to be actually the best choice to track this vulnerability.  - was mistaken by Apple as affected internally to the Webkit bug In fact, this CVE is affected to an information leak about heap addresses, disclosed by Chris Evans. Unfortunately, this info leak is also tracked as This is probably the "Apple/Google confusion" Steve was talking about.  - was assigned on March 14 to a xmlsec vulnerability, at my request. Both xmlsec and Webkit vulnerabilities have the same root cause, which is unrestricted access to libxslt features like file creation. In xmlsec, the vector is a "<ds:Transform>" tag in a signed file. In Webkit, it could a XML file, a XHTML page or a SVG image.  In my opinion, having the same root cause isn't a sufficient reason to affect the same CVE to both xmlsec and Webkit vulnerabilities.  Additionally, the fact that the xmlsec advisory about linked to a Webkit patch (in its **work-around** section) added some more confusion.  So, i propose to : - remove references to Webkit from the page - affect to the Webkit bug  Regards, Nicolas GrĂŠgoire   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
