I think we are likely to need exceptions to the "open as RHEL srpms" requirement.  It seems SUSE's SLE would not satisfy it (see distro-patches wiki), and I'm pretty sure we'd not benefit from not allowing SUSE folks, or asking them use the list info for OpenSUSE, but not for SLE.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
