If it's after, then > there's too little need for Oracle to have advance notification.  If we know about vulnerabilities in advance, our fixing process starts before Red Hat releases their updates. It starts with assessment of issue, reviewing the fix for completeness and applicability to our kernel and components we maintain or provide in our Linux distribution. See or http://oss.oracle.com/  We do not expect Red Hat or other vendors to evaluate impact of security vulnerabilities on Oracle Linux, nor fix it in a way that is applicable to our releases. Hence the request for subscription.  We have a large user base to protect. We do get reports of vulnerabilities in our Linux distribution which we may want to fix in collaboration with rest of the community.  > Oracle was never actually accepted to vendor-sec for Oracle Enterprise Linux.  Not correct. From archives of vendor-sec I see there had been at least two representatives from Oracle Linux at vendor-sec and we had membership ever since Oracle started distributing Linux.  This discussion was held whenever they requested to subscribe to vendor-sec and it was concluded that while we may be redistributing some packages, Oracle Linux is a distro in its own right.  > Then, the only @oracle.com person currently on oss-security (judging by > the e-mail addresses) appears not to be involved with Oracle Enterprise > Linux specifically.
