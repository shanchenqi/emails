Some of those  Indeed, for example if you use the engine, one can specify which directory should be used for drivers...  I uploaded a patch to  http://suse.de/~krahmer/libs-vs-fscaps  [modulo synchronization time] I will upload patches for other libs as soon as I wrote them. Included is support for __libc_enable_secure (which might be also not available on systems without glibc, or more particular without glibc rtld such as systems using bionic) but it needs to be enabled by hand inside the Makefile (as I dont know of an easy check to detect that). The "static" nature on most dists has already been mentioned.  The prefered way is to check the dumpable flag via prctl() which is detected by the config script. Additionally, euid and egid is always checked unless enable_secure or dumpable flag already detects secure-mode. I hope I didnt miss a getenv() (some are in testcases) and got the logic wrong. :p  l8er, -s   -- ~ perl self.pl ~ ~ krahmer@...e.de - SuSE Security Team  --- SUSE LINUX Products GmbH, GF: Jeff Hawn, Jennifer Guild, Felix Imendörffer, HRB (AG Nürnberg) Maxfeldstraße 5 Nürnberg Germany   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
