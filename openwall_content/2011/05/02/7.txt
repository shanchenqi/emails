Per the discussion so far, yes, or you would likely be in another category from the "open" Linux distro vendors.  I don't know what others in here would say if you, for example, only make advisories public, but not any code.  Maybe this will do (that is, folks would not oppose you being on the same list with the "open" vendors), maybe not.  A better option could be for you to make advisories and package metainfo public (file lists, change logs, etc.), but not the packages themselves. I similarly don't know how that would be received by others in here. On one hand, it would show that you're preparing security updates, for what software, and when.  On the other, the level of openness would still be less than Red Hat's.
