Most embedded Linux distributors don't have any concept of src.rpm or equivalent.  We primarily ship patches to our build infrastructure and meta-data in "some format".  Be it as patch files, installer "fragements", etc.  > Per the discussion so far, yes, or you would likely be in another > category from the "open" Linux distro vendors.

This is a more reasonable approach for the Embedded Linux distributors.  But keep in mind that due to our IT infrastructures and such, don't expect this type of change overnight.  However, if it would allow our participation in the closed lists we are certainly interested.  > I similarly don't know how that would be received by others in here. > On one hand, it would show that you're preparing security updates, for > what software, and when.

If I (as a non-RH customer) look to download their latest security updates, I don't see an obvious way of doing it based on their advisories.  For instance:   This advisory ends with:  (The unlinked packages above are only available from the Red Hat Network)  This requires that I have a support account in order to download the update. This is certainly different from the "Open" distributions, such as Fedora... but really isn't different from what Wind River is doing -- other then perhaps the verbose description of the issue.  --Mark  > Alexander >   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
