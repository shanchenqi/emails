Assuming I understand the issue correctly, there is precedent in CVE for  this kind of problem, or at least the exploitation of recursive  backup/archive programs as they process files (many seem related to  setting insecure permissions during the copy, and only setting the secure  permissions afterward, a la  is the only example I can easily find.  There is a "risk" of sorts to the community that a large number of these  issues could get disclosed for different packages in a short timeframe,  but this happens with any discovery of a new "class" of security problems  or attacks (look at the untrusted path stuff that happened last year with  Windows and Linux).  But IMO, better sooner rather than later.  Linux is a  multi-user OS and should be treated as such, which means local  file-writing/privilege attacks matter, even though they might not be as  severe as other kinds of attacks.  Somebody audited simpler symlink  problems in Debian packages a couple years ago, but while it must have  been very painful and there were dozens (hundreds?) of separate issues,  most of those problems seemed to get fixed in a relatively quick amount of  time.  Maybe the appropriate strategy is for the community to agree on a good way  of solving these problems before announcing all the different packages  that are affected, but it's just a thought.  Ultimately this decision is  up to the researcher, affected developers, and customers.  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
