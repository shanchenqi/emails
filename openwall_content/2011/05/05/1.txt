The first issue is yet another recurrence of the Internet Explorer 6 XSS vulnerability that caused the release of It was pointed out that there are dangerous extensions with more than four characters, so the regular expressions we introduced had to be updated to match longer extensions.  For more details, see  The second issue allows unauthenticated users to gain additional rights, on wikis where $wgBlockDisablesLogin is enabled. By default, it is disabled. The issue occurs when a malicious user sends cookies which contain the user name and user ID of a "victim" account. In certain circumstances, the rights of the victim are loaded and persist throughout the malicious request, allowing the malicious user to perform actions with the victim's rights.  $wgBlockDisablesLogin is a feature which is sometimes used on private wikis to prevent users who have an account from logging in and viewing content on the wiki.
