Very  <offtopic> We have many more rpm patches here: http://cvsweb.openwall.com/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/Owl/packages/rpm/ These are against rpm-4.2 and most of them are non-security, but they were required to make rpm usable for us.  For example, when a package is rebuilt with some changes but without Epoch/Version/Release change, and the old build contains some files that are not in the new build, and the package is upgraded on a system (such as with "-U --force"), the original rpm would leave orphaned files around on the system (security relevance: even SUID/SGID program binaries).  Ours removes those files. You could want to take a look at our patches and see if any are still relevant to rpm5. </offtopic>  > useful to follow this mailing list, but I am not part of a distro, at least > for now, and I can no longer follow it in the future due to the  recent > policy change. Thanks anyway.  Huh?  There's no policy change.  Are you possibly misinterpreting the "Closed list" thread as applying to the oss-security list?  It does not. The closed list is an alternative to the old vendor-sec and to the CC lists that started to appear in the month without vendor-sec.  It is not an alternative to oss-security.  In fact, with the new closed list being more limited than the old vendor-sec was, I expect more topics to be discussed on oss-security than there were when vendor-sec was around.
