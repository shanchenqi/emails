For example:   Also, there are "prev month", "next month", "prev day", and "next day" links at top.  If anyone is interested in the code:  http://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists  Suggestions/votes for further enhancements are welcome (we have a to-do list for blists internally, but we're unsure of what to work on next). This must not turn into a lengthy discussion thread of its own, which I think it won't.  Alexander  P.S. Five years of linux-kernel (almost 5 GB in mbox format) took two minutes to re-index, using 25 seconds of CPU time, on a fairly old machine and with the file being quite fragmented.  The index file size is approx. 3% of the mbox size (before the addition of Subjects and Froms, it was approx. 1%).  http://lists.openwall.net/linux-kernel/  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
