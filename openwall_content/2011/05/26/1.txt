In our (BalaBit) opinion tis is not a big security issue, because if you use the vulnerable setting you will run into the DoS for sure without any malicious attack.  The attack vector is that the attacker send a message which the regexp not match.   But because of this bug get this amount of attention, it' may worth the CVE id.
