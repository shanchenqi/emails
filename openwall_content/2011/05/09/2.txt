Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: kernel: cifs oops when creating file with O_DIRECT  set  CIFS does not do O_DIRECT, so when you open a file with it, you will  trigger a NULL pointer dereference. This is a regression introduced with  the patchset to clean up filehandle management in CIFS. The fix checks  for a NULL filp->private_data before trying to dereference it.
