Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE request: kernel: validate size of EFI GUID partition entries  The kernel automatically evaluates partition tables of storage devices.  The code for evaluating GUID partitions (in fs/partitions/efi.c)  contains a bug that can cause a kernel heap overflow on certain  corrupted GUID partition tables.
