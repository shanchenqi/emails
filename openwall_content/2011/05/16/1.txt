They usually just compare uid against euid (not even gid sometimes) and do not check the dumpable flag or AT_SECURE (dont know whether glibc exports a proper function to easily check that at all).  The libraries that I had a quick look at and which were found "vulnerable" are:  - - -  which is probably far from complete. Even if not linked directly to a privileged running program, these libraries may be introduced by plugins or frameworks (pam etc). As a result, attackers may specify plugin directories or rouge directory services for authentication as these libraries think they are running unprivileged. So better to fix them now than to be sorry in one year when they are going to be used the fscaps-way.
