It also exports __secure_getenv().  There is a problem: in upstream glibc, __libc_enable_secure is placed into GLIBC_PRIVATE section, thus making it unavailable in most of rpm-based distros.  This is surely not the case in Owl and ALT Linux, where __libc_enable_secure is legal interface for use in applications, and some essential libraries are already patched to use __libc_enable_secure instead of uid comparisons.   --  ldv  Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
