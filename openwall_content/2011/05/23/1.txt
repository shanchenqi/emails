The openssl config is a bit weird to me and the openssl project is not even providing distclean source tarballs for download (they contain symlinks etc.). It is also rather meant as a help for upstream which they could use as a base. I am sure they know better how to combine it with their config scripts and I am happy with changes as long as our resulting binary contains the hardening. I will try to ping the openssl developers about it.
