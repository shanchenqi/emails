These libs use getenv() to obtain information about configuration/files or plugin directories. These info can be "chosen with care" by attackers to trick the suid programs to execute code as root or do harm otherwise. Among these libs are libudev, libdbus, libhal, libgssglue or libcrypto (openssl). libudev, libdbus, libhal are linked against suid Xorg. libgssglue is linked against mount.nfs. Most of these libs were probably never intented to be linked against suids, but nevertheless they are.  Since the issues are all of the same family I would suggest to assign one CVE (or two, if you want to separate missing fscaps checks from euid != uid issue).  -s  [1] http://www.suse.de/~krahmer/libs-vs-fscaps/   --   ~ perl self.pl ~ ~ krahmer@...e.de - SuSE Security Team  --- SUSE LINUX Products GmbH, GF: Jeff Hawn, Jennifer Guild, Felix Imendörffer, HRB (AG Nürnberg) Maxfeldstraße 5 Nürnberg Germany   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
