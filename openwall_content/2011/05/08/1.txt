This may possibly cause a DoS by reading unmapped memory (if you're unlucky), or it may allow an attacker to infer the contents of kernel heap memory based on the parser's response.  -Dan  [1]  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
