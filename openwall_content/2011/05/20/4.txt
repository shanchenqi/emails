(the latest version) contains a directory traversal weakness whereby a remote malicious update server (responding to requests at updates.maxmind.com) may overwrite arbitrary files.  apps/geoipupdate.c, added a sanity check in but does not handle Windows paths containing backslash or colon.  apps/geoipupdate-pureperl.pl, introduced in does not filter any filenames returned by the remote server.  The fix is to reject invalid filenames, e.g., leading '.', or containing slash, backslash (Windows), or colons (Windows).
