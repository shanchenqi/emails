After more thinking however ... adding any option that influences how new passwords are generated means we have to patch all applications that generate passwords to honor that option, ie parse the config file. On OpenSUSE I've found pam_unix2, pwdutils, mkpasswd and yast2 so far. Biting the bullet and just hardcoding 2y would be much easier.  Nevertheless if we miss to patch any package there would be still the chance of someone generating 2a hashes with a different algorithm than what the system uses to verify them later though. So implementing your original idea and have crypt_gensalt change the prefix wouldn't be that bad after all. That bears the risk to break some programs like mkpasswd but they would at least fail with an error rather than generating unusable hashes.  cu Ludwig  --    (o_   Ludwig Nussel   //\   V_/_  http://www.suse.de/ SUSE LINUX Products GmbH, GF: Jeff Hawn, Jennifer Guild, Felix  ImendĂśrffer, HRB (AG NĂźrnberg)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
