Insufficient input sanitization on the parameters passed to pages related to administration settings, the javascript handler and the index handler leads to arbitrary javascript injection in the context of the user session. This could be potentially exploited to hijack the session of the administrator.  Insufficient path sanitization on the root 'action' query string parameter leads to inclusion of arbitrary files from local sources, this could be exploited to read arbitrary accessible files on the hosting server filesystem and potentially execute arbitrary commands or code.
