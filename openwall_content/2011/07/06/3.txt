Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE request: kernel: perf, x86: fix Intel fixed counters base initialization  The following patch solves the problems introduced by Robert's commit and reported by Arun Sharma. This commit gets rid of the base + index notation for reading and writing PMU msrs.  The problem is that for fixed counters, the new calculation for the base did not take into account the fixed counter indexes, thus all fixed counters were read/written from fixed counter 0.  Although all fixed counters share the same config MSR, they each have their own counter register.  This can cause a local denial of service.
