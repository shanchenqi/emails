Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE request: kernel: ipv6: make fragment identifications less predictable  IPv6 fragment identification generation is way beyond what we use for IPv4 : It uses a single generator. Its not scalable and allows DoS attacks.  Now inetpeer is IPv6 aware, we can use it to provide a more secure and scalable frag ident generator (per destination, instead of system wide)  This patch : 1) defines a new secure_ipv6_id() helper 2) extends inet_getid() to provide 32bit results 3) extends ipv6_select_ident() with a new dest parameter   Thanks, Eugene  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
