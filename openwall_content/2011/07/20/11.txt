Also, from the time, when has been released, couple of newer versions has been released too: 1) 2) 3) 4) 5) 6)  And the two not released yet: 7) 8)  But prior requesting CVE ids for these, I will first review the lists in 1) up to 8) and select only those, which might be interesting from  security point of view. Once the review is done, would attach another similar review document, like the one attached below.  For now it would be sufficient if you could allocate CVE ids for those issues.  Hope this being helpful && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team   On PM, Josh Bressers wrote: > Did these ever get IDs?
