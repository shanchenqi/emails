Luckily, it is well-maintained - Tom Lane committed a fix based on crypt_blowfish 1.1's on June 21st:   I've just e-mailed Tom to let him know about crypt_blowfish 1.2 with its more elaborate changes, and to try to persuade him to include the runtime quick self-test - to catch miscompiles, bugs potentially introduced in re-users of the code (such as in a future revision of pgcrypto - who knows), and to clean up the stack locations.
