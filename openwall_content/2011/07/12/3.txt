The default would be to use 2y by default. The option would be there as last resort only.  >> Keep using the buggy >> algorithm for new passwords and keep storing them as 2a > > I'd be unhappy about that, but it's a valid option to provide if you > want to minimize user annoyance, including for networked systems that > are not upgraded in sync (but are manually configured for this...)  The fourth possibility would be to use the 2y algorithm and store as 2a. That would be the better option if non-ASCII passwords are unlikely.  cu Ludwig  --    (o_   Ludwig Nussel   //\   V_/_  http://www.suse.de/ SUSE LINUX Products GmbH, GF: Jeff Hawn, Jennifer Guild, Felix  ImendĂśrffer, HRB (AG NĂźrnberg)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
