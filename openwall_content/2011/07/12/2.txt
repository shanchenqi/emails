Communication with apache security showed, that following symlinks to arbitrary locations is a documented feature, even when "-FollowSymLink" option is in place. This allows any user with, that can modify some content served by apache to access any content accessible by the apache process, also content not visible to the user (e.g. outside the ftp-upload directory or forbidden like /proc/http-pid/maps). Due to the small window of opportunity, this might be relevant mostly when user can already execute code on the machine, so it is not a big issue. /proc/<pid>/mem is protected, when apache is running with setuid, so key material cannot be extracted using range headers. PUT was not tested so far.
