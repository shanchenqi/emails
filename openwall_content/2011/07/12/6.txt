Communication  Especially in the early days of CVE, some were assigned for documented behavior.  The one I used to hit the most is a CVE for rlogind running (with all sorts of potential for insecurity based on how it's deployed, but not necessarily insecure in and of itself).  It would give some folks slaved to CVE-based security-scanning tools fits.  The scan tool flags a CVE for which nothing can really be done because it acts as documented.  --   Michael J.
