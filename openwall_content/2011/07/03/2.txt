These are not exactly contradictory (please read them in context), yet perhaps we should patch the issue sooner rather than later.  Question to OpenSSL developers: is the patch given in Billy Bob Brumley and Nicola Tuveri's paper "Remote Timing Attacks Are Still Practical" OK to be used by distros?  Basically, I am interested in its "review status" by upstream - reviewed and approved, reviewed but not approved for specific reasons, not sufficiently reviewed.  (The patch is tiny, but even tiny changes might have non-obvious implications.)
