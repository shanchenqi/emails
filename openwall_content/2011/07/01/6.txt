Following PHP bug is marked as security and lists   The fix is committed, hence should be released with  Reporter mentions this really was an underlying glob() implementation flaw, but that's not entirely true.  Maybe there are some flags that are not recognized by glob() and still cause it to crash, but the crashes I've been able to reproduce were due to the use of flags supported by glob() that require some glob_t struct setup before calling glob() (such as GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC).  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
