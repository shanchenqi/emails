As far as I know the vulnerability was described as "Information Disclosure" not patch disclosure. Path disclosures should be fixed from software also, but usually it is a problem in web-server configuration. Do you have more information about issue Still no reply from Joomla security team regarding issue I asked more details nearly a week ago. > > Btw.
