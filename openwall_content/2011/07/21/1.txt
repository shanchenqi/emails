Done.  I kept the old one, but added a mention of it's existence in the regular NetBSD entry.  >> p.s.

I'm afraid I don't know about interest.  I had hoped others would have jumped in earlier... but they have not...  In the end did the opensolaris based distributions get into the closed linux list?  If not, I wonder if a list for everyone who repackages/distributes free/open source software (other than linux distro's) would make more sense than a BSD specific one?  As far as you being on the list... I at least have no problem with it.  In fact I would be surprised to find much if anything on such a list that was not also on the linux list. (My personal preference would be to have the BSD folks on the linux list and trust us to just ignore the kernel issues that are not relevant to us :)  Thanks for all your work to provide good communication options!   - Tim  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
