In fact, this was one of the things I considered when I decided to start with a Linux-only closed list.  > In the end did the opensolaris based distributions get into the closed > linux list?  No, and they didn't ask for it.  I don't think they're on oss-security either - I guess they're just not interested.  However, as you have seen from discussions on oss-security, the Oracle person who formally joined for Oracle Linux is actually a Solaris person. I find this weird.  > If not, I wonder if a list for everyone who > repackages/distributes free/open source software (other than linux > distro's) would make more sense than a BSD specific one?  Maybe, but I would like to see which projects/distros are actually interested in being on such a list _and_ are on oss-security.  The latter requirement is needed because it does not make much sense to receive notifications of embargoed issues, yet miss notifications of issues being made public without embargo.  > As far as you being on the list...

The effectively Linux-specific issues sometimes brought up on the list are not limited to the kernel, though.  On the other hand, in those cases when someone brings up an issue that is not Linux-specific, the reporter is not always willing to spend time to notify the *BSD's even when asked to and pointed at the wiki page with contacts.  Having a bsd-distros list that we could simply CC would be helpful in such occasions.  But setting one up and subscribing *BSD security contacts who expressed no interest in this kind of setup (except for you) is weird.  > Thanks for all your work to provide good communication options!
