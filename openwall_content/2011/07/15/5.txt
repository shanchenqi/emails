Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: Exim: DKIM Format String  A format string vulnerability affects the Exim SMTP server with DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) support, version between and The DKIM logging mechanism did not use format string specifiers when logging some parts of the DKIM-Signature header field. A remote attacker who is able to send emails, can exploit this vulnerability and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Exim daemon [1].  MITRE assigned to this vulnerability but the entry was not updated [2]. We would appreciate if it can be updated, we are using this CVE name in one of our new Nmap scripts [3].  Thanks.
