Which is kind of ugly as that's a file the admin may have modified.  Anyways, we have the prefix configurable in /etc/default/password too (CRYPT=blowfish). So no magic config file editing needed. The programs parsing that file all do the blowfish=>2a mapping themselves though as there is no lib unfortunately. So we have to touch several packages to s/2a/2y/.

Meanwhile I've found that libxcrypt's crypt_gensalt actually also may change the prefix. It has a fallback to DES if the requested prefix isn't available as plugin. So mkpasswd was broken in that regard always. That error never happened though as mkpasswd didn't support any prefix libxcrypt didn't support too.  > I am tempted to just release the current code as 1.2 now.
