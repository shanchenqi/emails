This change was triggered by legal claims by Carnegie Mellon University linked to the fact that not only we need a license in order to use CERT in our name (which we obtained in after the first claim) but that in order to use the license it can never be implied that CERT is an acronym [1] for Computer Emergency Response Team (this last claim was made just now in  Luckily we have better things to do with our time than engaging in possible legal battles, therefore we decided to comply (the "long" name appeared only twice on our site anyway).  To any OSS project that uses or will want to use CERT in this fashion, you have been warned. I hope one day the security community can legally claim the CERT acronym back without risking these kind of consequences.
