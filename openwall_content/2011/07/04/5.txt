They are different, but as OEL is based on RHEL, I believe they're still sufficiently similar (same upstream versions, mostly the same patches and spec files) to expect most flaws affecting components shipped in both should affect both distros in the same way.  Hence the interest in those differences that required different fixes in the past, or were for the common component but did not affect one of the distros.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
