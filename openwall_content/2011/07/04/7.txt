So far, the closest to a description of the bug that I saw is this:   but it's not enough.  I'd like to learn not only on my own, but also on others' mistakes. ;-) And for this purpose it does not matter how old the software is and whether it is still supported or not.  Colin - any comments from you?  I realize the bug is not yours, but perhaps you're one of the few people who have figured it out now, for a reason similar to mine.  Red Hat - a lesson for you might be to stop linking sshd against so many libraries (over 20 last time I checked).  Don't wait until your remote root, really. ;-)  Yes, this means dropping some functionality, or maybe moving it to extra builds of sshd that only a small subset of systems will choose to run (e.g., configurable via /etc/sysconfig/sshd). Just an idea.  Thanks,  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
