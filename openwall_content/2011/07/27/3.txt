I think it'd be a good idea to keep track of these issues per-library on the wiki:  http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/code-reviews  > [1] http://www.suse.de/~krahmer/libs-vs-fscaps/  I got your OpenSSL changes into Owl-current yesterday (except for the changes to OPENSSL_issetugid() itself, which on Owl was already using __libc_enable_secure).  The rest of the libraries that you mention are not in Owl.
