Kind of like how strcpy()  can be subject to buffer overflows, *if* the programmer isn't careful.  Also happened with confusing return values from certain OpenSSL API  functions a couple years ago.  (The PHP_SELF example is similar.)  So,  this should probably get separate CVEs for each application/library that  misuses the relevant function(s).  If Qt itself contains misuse of its own functions - which happens  sometimes for OpenSSL) - then Qt might need its own CVE,  too.  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
