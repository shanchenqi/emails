I remember to have checked udhcpc at that time and neither I found it setting a hostname or parsing the options for a hostname. The hostname it is using must be passed on the commandline and are rather added to the request than parsed from a reply.  While we are on the hostname issue again, AFAIR the kernel contains a DHCP client and was accepting hostname options so it could theoretically be attacked the same way as with dhclient. However this seems only a use-case for thin clients with NFS-root or so and in such a case you can execute code on the client anyways. So its not really worth fixing, except for vendors which lock down their embedded devices before shipping it to their customers, but who is doing that? :)  Sebastian   On Wed, Jul 27, at Tomas Hoger wrote: > On Tue, 26 Jul (EDT) Josh Bressers wrote: >  > Just to clarify... >  > > Use for udhcpc >  > This is dhcp client that is part of busybox. >  > > for udhcp6c. >  > This should say dhcp6c and is part of the (now obsolete) dhcpv6 project: >  >   https://fedorahosted.org/dhcpv6/ >  > --  > Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  --   ~ perl self.pl ~ ~ krahmer@...e.de - SuSE Security Team  --- SUSE LINUX Products GmbH, GF: Jeff Hawn, Jennifer Guild, Felix Imendörffer, HRB (AG Nürnberg) Maxfeldstraße 5 Nürnberg Germany   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
