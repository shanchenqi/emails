I've just described the new list and some of its policies in the newly added "Linux distribution security contacts list" section at:  http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/vendor-sec  Maybe this will need to be moved to its own wiki page or to a wiki page on multiple non-historical closed lists if we ever host several at once. (Non-Linux lists may be setup if there's demand.)
