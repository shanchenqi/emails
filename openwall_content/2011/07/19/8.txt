We plan to make the issue public as soon as we have a CVE and can publish our advisory. However, almost every detail of the vulnerability has been already discussed on this list.  (Summary: the status of the certificate will not be checked)  Thus, the patch does not reveal any further aspects of the vulnerability and the only reason that we do not want to publish it publicly is that the fact that it may be incomplete and/or introduce side effects because we do not have a complete test environment.   > I'm CCing upstream (Alan DeKok), as it seems this thread may be giving > out more info than expected.
