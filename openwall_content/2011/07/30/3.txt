To show what's coming to the list, and to make sure everyone in here approves that we reject these things unconditionally going forward.  If anyone in here wants to see these on the list, please let me know. Otherwise, I'll assume that we've voted unanimously to have them rejected.  Ditto for e-magazine issue announcements - that is, unless anyone tells me they want to see those in here, I'll be rejecting any and all of them without having to analyze them for content relevant to both security and Open Source at once.  2. Not to give the other Indian conference a competitive advantage, since I had similarly approved their CFP:   No one appeared to care about the issues I raised when approving that previous CFP, which to me means that no one cared to see the CFP itself as well - so we got very close to the decision to be rejecting these unconditionally, which would make things easy for me as a moderator. :-)  Thanks,  Alexander  On Sat, Jul 30, at Abhijeet Patil wrote: > Its time for hackers across the globe to gather in India. > ClubHack announces its CFP open for See > ...
