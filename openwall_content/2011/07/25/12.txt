The patch here was dropped when RPM was forked and the CVE was essentially a replay of an issue that was already fixed 5 years ago (and the patch was NOT dropped in @rpm5.org cvs).  (aside) I believe there are better fixes if the link count is more carefully checked always and everywhere. While rpm package metadata does not (and SHOULD not) carry an expected value for st->st_nlinks, its rather easy to synthesize an expected link count given the inode information (which is in rpm metadata) and to warn (either with --verify, or perhaps always) if the link count is not as expected.  There are other (and better) approaches if the actual values on the file system, including files not contained in packages, is stored in an rpmdb: its a fundamental design flaw in RPM that only package metadata installed in an rpmdb is ever used for security auditing.  But there's no harm at all in removing SUID/SGID bits from files that are being removed in case there's an additional link that has been added.  hth  73 de Jeff  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
