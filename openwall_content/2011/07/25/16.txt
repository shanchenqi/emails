The same risk is present in upstream's version of the fix.  > Is it possible with these orphaned files (I'm not familiar with the code > in question)?  Yes, but this problem is not limited to this specific piece of code. rpm appears to treat the target directory tree as trusted - not only when it removes files, but also when it creates files, etc.  I did not fully verify this, though - that's just how the code looks to me.  This general issue is in fact a security risk.  For example, if the directory tree contains a subdirectory writable by a pseudo-user, then a possible compromise of this pseudo-user account might lead to worse things via rpm.  Here's an example of such directory on Owl:  # ls -la /var/lib/dhcp/dhcpd/state/ total 8 drwxrwx--T 2 root dhcp Dec 14  . drwxr-x--- 3 root dhcp Dec  8  .. -rw------- 1 dhcp dhcp    0 Dec  8  dhcpd.leases  We may discuss this general issue (of rpm trusting the target tree, and the resulting risks) separately.  Thank you for the review!  BTW, another detail I thought someone might notice is that I am applying the chmod's not only to binary packages, like the upstream fix does, but I think also to source packages being removed/upgraded (I did not actually test this, though).  This might be excessive, or it might not, but I felt that it does not hurt either way.
