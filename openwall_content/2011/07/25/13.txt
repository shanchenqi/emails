Without disclosing too much, I'd go for a per module based CVE.  So one per  affected KDE module + 1 per affected Qt module, + 1 per app that does its own  thing (i.e. Arora, Rekonq and others we've already identified).  I think that's  the most intelligent thing to do although I do think that one of the concerns  is that more examples will likely come out of the woodwork (it's nothing that  can easily be identified programatically) and each edge case is likely to be  fairly application unique.  As an analogy, the best I can think of is XSS via  PHP_SELF, do we give the CVE to PHP, frameworks that use PHP or individual  apps that use it badly?  From what I can tell it seems to be per app/framework  module.
