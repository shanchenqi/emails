Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org>,         Herman van Rink <rink@...tfour.nl> CC: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com Subject: CVE-Request -- phpMyAdmin -- and  Hello Josh, Steve, vendors,     the following two doesn't seem to have CVE identifiers yet: 1)  A local file inclusion and arbitrary SQL code execution flaws were found in the way phpMyAdmin, the MySQL over WWW administration tool, performed 'export_type' sanitization, when retrieving and verifying relation schema export options. A local attacker could use this flaw to obtain security sensitive information or, potentially, execute arbitrary SQL code with the privileges of the user running the query.  References: [1] [2] http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/news.php [3]  Upstream patches: [4]   Further flaw exploitation note: An attacker must be logged in via phpMyAdmin to exploit this problem.  Affected versions: Versions to are affected.  2)  A session values manipulation flaw was found in the way phpMyAdmin, the MySQL over WWW administration tool, performed sanitization of the  user-provided query string, when the Swekey extension based  authentication method was enabled. A remote attacker could use this flaw  to manipulate the PHP session superglobal variable via specially-crafted  query string provided to the Swekey authentication module.  References: [1] [2] http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/news.php [3] [4]  Upstream patches: [5]  [6]   Patches against v3.3 branch: [7]  [8]   Affected Versions: The and earlier versions are affected. Branch is not affected by this.  3) The other two recent phpMyAdmin issues (addressed in  already have CVE identifiers: [1] [2]  Cc-ed phpMyAdmin upstream contact, Herman van Rink, to correct me on the description of the 1) and 2) flaws, where appropriate.  Josh, Steve, could you please allocate CVE ids for 1) and 2) issues?
