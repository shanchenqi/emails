Earlier this year, was assigned to ICS's dhclient and dhcpcd for an insufficient DHCP option checking.  Similar issue affects busybox's udhcpc.  dhcpv6's dhcp6c was previously mentioned and it seems also fixed in SUSE, but did not get its own CVE.  The impact for DHCPv6 clients seems significantly lower, as there's no support for hostname option, only domain search option.  I'm not sure if anyone identified any good target that handles search option insecurely, I've only found shtool's sh.echo that may use it in sed script, resulting in sed script injection with file overwrite or code execution impact.  Given that dhclient and dhcpcd got separate CVEs, udhcpc and dhcp6c should probably get separate ids too.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
