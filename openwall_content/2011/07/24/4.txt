Better now. This is how I'd phrase it:  ---- A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was found in cgit, a fast web interface for Git, allowing a remote attacker with push access to a repository to inject arbitrary HTML code. The new file name in rename hints is not escaped and can be exploited by renaming some file to a file with specially-crafted file name, thus leading to a permanent XSS. ----  By the way, this is already fixed in current stable [1] (just because nobody mentioned it yet).
