But I could be wrong.  Thanks for the CC -- as a guess as to what happened; was this particular mirror compromised and the original tarball modified (along with its mtime) to match the original Feb 15th date?  Does anyone have a "we noticed it first" flag that is before July 3rd?  Debian (and most other repos) are storing the of each source package, so a Feb 15 date does seem incredible, but so does the complete pwnage of a non-official mirror with the original mtime, at the same moment as an official dist server compromise. A nightly rsync would account for this, but we would need to know more about the mirror structure from Chris.  I am happy to correct the metasploit module if new facts arrive; thank you to everyone who spends their free time dealing with this crap.  -HD  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
