Lots of hits for indeed - due to the incident announcement.  Thus, chances are that no distro is affected.  More info on what's inside the tarball: user/group "user" (either the intruder's username on his/her computer or --owner and --group options argument to tar), "GCC: (Ubuntu/Linaro inside the .o files.  This suggests Ubuntu right?  BTW, what if the .o files _don't_ match the source code? ;-)  I think they might be used when one builds vsftpd from this tarball, which means that the build (or run) will fail on some older systems (yet another reason why this would be noticed quickly), but also that the actual backdoor might be different (and more sophisticated) from what we see in the source code.  No, I don't think this is the case, but the possibility is there, and I find it curious.  A trivial way to check for this would be to try compiling the source code on Ubuntu and see if the .o files match.  If not, the differences will need to be analyzed manually.  Not that anyone cares...  Alexander  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
