Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: CVE mistake in libsoup release notes  Upstream mistakenly used the wrong CVE name in the recent libsoup releases.  They should have used but used instead.  I don't know who's pool might be in, but I would recommend rejecting that CVE name and duping it against  I've seen both Gentoo and Novell reference the wrong CVE name in bugzilla entries, so I thought I should bring this up.  See:  and it's follow-up comment from upstream (they've made the appropriate changes in git now to reflect the correct CVE name).  So is the correct CVE, and is the _wrong_ CVE.
