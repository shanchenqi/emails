The new CVE identifier of has been assigned to this issue (as an incomplete fix for issue).  Kudos to Tomas Hoger and Jeffrey Layton for their analysis of the issue:  check_mtab() calls check_newline() to check device and directory name. check_newline() returns EX_USAGE (1) when error is detected, while  check_mtab() expects -1 to indicate an error.  and to Jeffrey Layton again for providing the patch almost immediately: [1]  References: [2]  Thank you && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
