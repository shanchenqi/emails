Understood. I've looked at the issue more closely and found a similar DOS-exploitable timerace and a buffer overwrite unrelated to this. Just for study, I'm currently trying to combine 3 timeraces + buffer overwrite + ROP to get code execution. Since apache will quite likely fix the other two issues, they have to touch the code anyway, so the symlink issue might be historic soon also.  - --  http://www.halfdog.net/ PGP: AE98 B91F FE88  2BD8 feed a bee -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  =/V3r -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
