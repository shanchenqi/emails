I don't think the race conditions can be fixed without openat, which  is available in Linux since and is not available in many other  flavours of UNIX. Currently, it is clear that your issue only concerns  an un-supported use case of Apache httpd. IMHO it would not be wise to  change httpd to support this use case on recent Linux but not on other  UNIXs.  And if you have a setup where the races are a problem, you can fix it  outside of httpd. E.g. configure your FTP-server to deny creating of  symlinks or configure SELinux/Apparmor/... accordingly.
