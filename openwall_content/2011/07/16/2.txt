It looks like the flaw used to jailbreak the iphone was in freetype's PS type1 font handling.  I've taken a quick look, but am by no means a C guy, but the code paths are different in freetype 2.2.x and it looks as thought at least (so perhaps all of 2.3.x?) is affected.  The Secunia report indicates and possibly older versions.
