A remote attacker could provide a message with specially-crafted hash signature in it, leading to denial of service (clamscan executable crash).  Upstream bug report: [2]  Relevant patch: [3]   Other references: [4] [5]  [6] http://www.clamav.net/lang/en/ [7]  Note: The rest of the issues fixed in [1] seem to be just bug fixes.        Cc-ed upstream Clam Antivirus maintainers to confirm this (that        there is only one issue with security implications) and correct        the description of the issue, if necessary (just guessing that        "cli_hm_scan()" stands for        command_line_interface_hash_manager_scan, since it doesn't seem        to be described in the code anywhere).  Josh, Steve, could you allocate a CVE id for this?
