Hi,  I'm sorry I'm late to comment on this.  Since it's been a while, I'll include the entire message by halfdog below (it's too long to top-quote).  My opinion is that we have a real issue here, and it's been patched in GNU tar (Paul Eggert did all the hard work - thanks!)  In his writeup, halfdog has included copies of two lengthy e-mails by me from our discussion of the issue in (with GNU tar developers and CERT CC'ed).  I recommend reading those:   Now that we have a fix in GNU tar, the question is whether any other tools need fixing as well, and which ones.  I am not sure.  We could as well declare that GNU tar is the only tool intended to perform backups with. ;-)  Really, what alternatives are there?  Some proprietary backup tools (that traverse directories on their own rather than invoke tar)?  Of free software, rsync and cpio come to mind, but I wouldn't call these backup tools.  Of these, I expect that rsync has lots of other security risks if used on untrusted directory trees, and cpio's functionality is not any better than tar's (for backups).  I understand that a lot of people do (mis)use rsync on untrusted trees, though, so someone might want to review it, enumerate the security problems, and then decide what to do about them.  Meanwhile, to me rsync is just not meant to be used on untrusted directory trees.
