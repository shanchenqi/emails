According to SUSE bug, there are two different implementations of the filter - one in perl and one in c - in different foomatic versions. Both are affected by the same kind of problem, even though they don't share vulnerable code.  Is one CVE sufficient here, or is Mitre likely to split and assign another when this is processed?
