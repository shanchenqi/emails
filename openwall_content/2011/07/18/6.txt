I'm not sure if anyone else uses system-config-firewall and system-config-printer, but we had a report of a privilege escalation flaw that could allow a user with access to run these commands to elevate their privileges due to insecure use of the python pickle module.  The solution is to use JSON rather than pickle.  The details and a patch for are available in our bugzilla:   Thanks.  --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
