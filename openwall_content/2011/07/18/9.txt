As the name suggests, it is a Linux distros only list.  Also, please note that the maximum acceptable embargo period on this list is 14 days.  We need to communicate this detail to whoever we're asking to disclose anything to the list, before they disclose.  When posting to the list, you may encrypt messages to the attached key.  For FreeRADIUS specifically, it sounds like non-Linux vendors could be interested as well.  DFN-CERT did mention Linux distros specifically in the quote above, so the suggestion to use the list was appropriate, but perhaps requests from other distros shipping FreeRADIUS should be accommodated as well.  If something like this arrived to the Linux distros list without prior discussion on oss-security, I would bring this up and suggest that we contact *BSD's at least.  Since this is already on oss-security, I assume that interested *BSD's and others may ask DFN-CERT themselves. ;-)  > Gentoo complies to your requirements > and would like to get the patch directly, if you do not plan to send it > there.
