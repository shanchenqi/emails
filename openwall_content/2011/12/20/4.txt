The year is almost always obtained from either:  1) When the CVE was first privately reserved.  We already have more than     two hundred numbers reserved for various CNAs who are     using them to coordinate disclosures that are scheduled to     happen in  This date often correlates with the year that the vuln     was found, but not always.  2) When the issue was first made public.  There can be some disagreement     about when a vuln is first published (e.g. a bug report may lie     unresolved, technically viewable by anybody, for a few years before it     reaches general awareness, or something might be published on December     31 in one part of the world when it is January 1 in another part of the     world.)  Some CNAs who have a pool of CVEs from one year, will continue to use that  pool in the next year if there are any CVEs left over, though I generally  discourage it.  In January and February you will probably still see a fairly large  number of new identifiers released, as MITRE/etc. assign  CVEs to issues that were first published in  - Steve   On Mon, 19 Dec Kurt Seifried wrote:  > > -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- > Hash: SHA1 > > On PM, Tim Sammut wrote: >> Hi, >> >> Is there a general guideline that is commonly used when deciding to >> issue a CVE name from the pool of a previous year versus the current >> year's pool? >> >> thanks and hope all is well >> tim >> > Generally speaking the year the vuln was found or reported is the year > that gets used for the CVE.
