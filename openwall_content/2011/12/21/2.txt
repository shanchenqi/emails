The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the  "ulSetError()" function (src/util/ulError.cxx) when creating the error  message, which can be exploited to overflow a static buffer.  Successful exploitation allows the execution of arbitrary code but  requires that the attacker can e.g. control the content of an overly  long error message passed to the "ulSetError()" function.  The vulnerability is confirmed in version Other versions may also  be affected. ======================  Please use for this issue.  --   -Kurt Seifried / Red Hat Security Response Team    Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
