An attacker can issue multiple ActiveMQ openwire connection requests using the string and due to the 'failure' mechanism, all TCP connections remain active even if a valid session is not created.  After a few thousand requests, a 'java.net.SocketException: Too many open files' exception is triggered, leading to a freeze or crash of the broker (and possibly connected systems as well).
