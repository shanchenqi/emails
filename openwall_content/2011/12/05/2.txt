The 3 other issues got CVEs assigned here:   - An error within the QDM2 decoder (libavcodec/qdm2.c) can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow.  Seems to be the following commits in libavcodec/qdm2.c (at least the last one, the others seem to be a bit older):  Last commit says this fixes  - An integer overflow error within the "vp3_dequant()" function (libavcodec/vp3.c) can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow.  Seems to be the following commit in libavcodec/vp3.c:  Commit says this fixes  - Errors within the "av_image_fill_pointers()", the "vp5_parse_coeff()", and the "vp6_parse_coeff()" functions can be exploited to trigger out-of-bounds reads.  Seems to be the following commits in libavutil/imgutils.c, libavcodec/vp5.c, libavcodec/vp6.c:   So, the fourth issue, which is fixed by the following commit that matches the description doesn't seem to have a CVE number, and doesn't seem to be related to the others:  "An error within the "svq1_decode_frame()" function (libavcodec/svq1dec.c) can be exploited to corrupt memory."   Commit says it fixes  Marc.    Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
