You are only vulnerable if *all* of the following conditions are met:   1. You are using TYPO3 version up to  or (+     development releases of 4.7 branch).  2. You have all of following PHP configuration variables set to "on":     register_globals ("off" by default, advised to be "off" in TYPO3     Security Guide     <http://typo3.org/documentation/document-library/extension-manuals/doc_guide_security/current/>),     allow_url_include ("off" by default) and allow_url_fopen ("on" by     default)  If you are using the Suhosin PHP extension you are only vulnerable if you have additionally put URL schemes in the configuration variable "suhosin.executor.include.whitelist".  The workspaces system extension does not need to be activated for this vulnerability to exist.  *Possible Impact:* A crafted request to a vulnerable TYPO3 installation will allow an attacker to load PHP code from an external source and to execute it on the TYPO3 installation.  *Solution:* You can choose one of the solutions below:   1. Update to the TYPO3 version or that fix the problem     described!  2. Set at least one of following PHP configuration variables to "off":     register_globals, allow_url_include and allow_url_fopen  3. Apply the patch that is linked below!  4.
