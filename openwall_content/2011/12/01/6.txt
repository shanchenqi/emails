Contributors =========================== Billy Brumley <billy.brumley [at] aalto [dot] fi> Manuel Barbosa <mbb [at] di.uminho [dot] pt> Dan Page <page [at] cs.bris.ac [dot] uk> Fre Vercauteren <fvercaut [at] esat.kuleuven.ac [dot] be>    Vulnerability description =========================== The openssl-dev mailing list thread   describes a bug affecting 32-bit builds of OpenSSL In extremely  rare instances, it causes incorrect computation of finite field operations  when using NIST elliptic curves or  Exploiting said bug, we designed and implemented an attack that recovers a  TLS server's private key. As far as we are aware, this is the first public  exploitation of the bug.  The bug is fixed in OpenSSL >= and a series of patches is available  to resolve it for version starting from check in version at   As a more generic countermeasure to these types of attacks, we implemented  coordinate blinding as a patch to the OpenSSL source, available on the  openssl-dev mailing list at   You can find our manuscript describing the attack at   and our proof-of-concept code to verify the attack at  http://crypto.di.uminho.pt/CACE/    Vulnerability prerequisites =========================== REQUIRED:  - OpenSSL (32-bit build)  One or more of: - Use of curve - Use of curve  One or more of: - Use of ECDH family ciphers - Use of ECDHE family ciphers *and* lack of SSL_OP_SINGLE_ECDH_USE context  option  Ubuntu Karmic ships with OpenSSL and we verified the attack  against it. Debian 5.0 Lenny ships with OpenSSL and, although we did not verify  the attack, the code suggests it is vulnerable. We verified the attack against stunnel (linked against OpenSSL  configured to use an ECDH cipher and Our methods do not seem to be effective for attacking OpenSSH: their  implementation strictly uses ephemeral ECDH keys.    Vulnerability impact =========================== The attack allows recovery of a TLS server's private key. For ECDH family ciphers, this is the long term private key of the public  key in a certificate. For ECDHE family ciphers, this is the private key of the per application  instance's ECDH ephemeral-static public key. The attack is remote and in that sense only requires observing the result  (success or failure) of repeated attacker-initiated TLS handshakes.
