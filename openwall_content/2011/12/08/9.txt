Sorry, misunderstood what you were getting at  :-)  Yes, agreed. It should be defined better, and as you pointed out apps trying to filter or restrict things can be prone to mistakes. Which I think exactly points out why this CVE is invalid; the lack of real specification means that an application cannot successfully guess what is valid, nor is it specified that an application should even try to make such guesses. Given the current situation, OpenPAM is culpable here, both for not checking the data it's receiving, and for having a specification that makes it impossible for upstream apps to properly try to help out.  --Jeff    Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
