I considered this a low impact vulnerability and therefore followed the procedures for reporting to oss-security. Additionally, I looked for a security contact at http://www.icecast.org/contact.php but could not find one, so I sent to the list since it said this was a valid way to submit bugs. If the issue were more severe, I would have followed a different procedure. I apologize for the inconvenience.  > We're already aware of Moritz's finding and are working on a fix. >  > Expect icecast release soon.  Glad to hear.
