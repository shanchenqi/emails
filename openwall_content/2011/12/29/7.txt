As stated in our timeline the embargo date was requested by reporters: vulnerability report received, reporters set embargo date to December 27th"  Our disclosure policy also says: "- in any circumstance reporter preference will always be honoured in case a joint agreement is not reached, as oCERT would be anyway unable to force its embargo"  We tried to negotiate an earlier embargo time as, obviously, many complained about the unfortunate timing considering xmas holidays but the reporters really wanted to release this after the CCC talk.  It is oCERT policy to not leak reports before the desired date set by the reporters if a more favourable one is not agreed upon.  Hope this clarifies the exception.
