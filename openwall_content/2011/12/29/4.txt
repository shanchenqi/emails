(I assume oCERT also contacted non-Linux distributions separately.)  This was the first major exception to linux-distros' list policy to limit embargoes to 14 days at most (after initial posting to the list).  I did not object this time because the underlying issue was publicly known and the impact was limited to DoS.  Well, and I was not given an opportunity to object other than by asking for the CRD to be moved to an earlier date, which would likely not work for others.  (I am not complaining.)  Yet I feel that I need to post in here and state that this does not set a precedent, that the "14 days" policy is in effect, and that occasional exceptions, if any, need to be agreed upon in advance (unlike it happened this time).  That is, if someone wants to report an issue via the linux-distros or distros lists and propose a longer embargo period, they need to state so first, without disclosing much detail about the issue to the list.  I think it may be OK (although this might vary on a case by case basis) to disclose the minimum required for list members to agree to a longer embargo period as a rare exception (like it would probably happen for these hash collision issues), object to it (have the list notified with detailed info closer to the proposed CRD), or/and opt to request the detail individually (not via the list).  I think this is a rare exception to oCERT's policy, too.  It says:  "- under extremely exceptional circumstances, if the oCERT Team and all the parties involved feel the need for longer time, a 2 months embargo can be applied, in this case we would clearly document the decision for public review"  Andrea - you could want to "clearly document the decision for public review" now, although I guess your rationale was similar to mine (when I decided not to object to the unusually long embargo period this time).  Thank you for your work on this issue!  I imagine it was pretty time-consuming with so many affected projects.
