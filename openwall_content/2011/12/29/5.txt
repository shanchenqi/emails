I've just unsubscribed Hui Zhu, who apparently is no longer with Wind River - e-mail started bouncing, and the LinkedIn profile says "March - December (not "- Present"):  http://cn.linkedin.com/in/teawater  Zhenfeng(Jeffrey) Zhao is still subscribed, so Wind River is still present on the linux-distros and distros lists.  BTW, this is a good example of how PGP with people's personal keys helps - even if the e-mail address would be e.g. forwarded to a non-security person at Wind River, that person would (hopefully) not have Hui's PGP key.  Alexander  P.S. Indeed, I would have preferred to learn of this from a Wind River person rather than from their mail server and own "investigation". ;-)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
