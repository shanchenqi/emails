Can you reply with the mapping information that you used to determine that this issue was not assigned a CVE (as opposed to one of the other issues)?. Also can you confirm or proove that these 4 issues are all separate and that two of them have not been merged (thus obviating any need for a third CVE)? Thanks in advance. If anyone from Secunia is on this list I'd love to hear from you/any comments on this issue are more then welcome.  --   -Kurt Seifried / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
