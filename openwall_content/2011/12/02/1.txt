The fix removed a line in the code that displayed an unsanitised variable in one of the template files. This variable was inside a JavaScript comment block, but this does not prevent exploitation when the payload is prefixed with a </script> tag.

Secunia is linking in to which has nothing to do with the actual issue. Shame on Secunia.  This is one of logs, which can act like proof:  Please notify me if this is not enough information.  - Henri Salo   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
