This could be further exploited in the in the context of virtualization, because virtio disks support a limited form of SCSI passthrough via the SG_IO ioctl. If virtio disk is hosted on a partition or LVM volume with format=raw, tools such as sg_dd can be used to read and write other data on the same disk --- even data that belongs to the host or to other guests.
