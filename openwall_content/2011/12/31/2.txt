Do X and Y have any of the following characteristics?    * X appears in a different DLL, library, or program than Y (e.g. X     affects LIB1.DLL and Y affects LIB2.DLL)   * X has more serious impact than Y (e.g. code execution as root versus     leak of system pathname)   * X takes a different input parameter/argument than Y (e.g. SQL     injection in both the "user" and "password" parameters)   * X is exploitable locally, but Y is not.   * X requires stronger authentication than Y.   * X can be exploited by a certain user that Y can not (e.g. a guest     user vs. an admin)  *Yes:* *MERGE  *Please use for these two issues * * > > > > Fixed in same version Aphrodite so one CVE-identifier might be enough. > > - Henri Salo Does anyone have a contact name for Secunia with respect to co-ordinating CVE assignments better?  --   -- Kurt Seifried / Red Hat Security Response Team    Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
