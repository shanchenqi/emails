What's the point of a capabilities system if its equivalent to root in the majority of cases anyway?  For file access/operations, there is always sudo and the /etc/sudoers file for making it easy to access to stuff thats accessed often without a password.  For port binding, the capabilities system makes sense; and according to Brad Spengler's list, those caps don't appear to be root equivalent so that could stay. Otherwise, I don't see the point.  I'm not sure if there is a written security model for the capabilities system, but this looks to me like it would be a violation of it.
