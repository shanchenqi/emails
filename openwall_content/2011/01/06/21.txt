In fact, was also related to directory  traversals.  is about dpkg being happy to pass patches with invalid paths  to patch and following symlinks in the .pc directory.  That said, I don't know if quilt itself is affected by the .pc directory  issue, and if it is, whether it is really relevant.  For further reference, addresses the flaws in dpkg:   Cheers, --  Raphael Geissert - Debian Developer www.debian.org - get.debian.net    Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
