I took a quick look at the maradns.org web to see what contact info I can find as someone who may want to report a security flaw, but does not have any closer relationship with project's upstream or community.  The main page suggests using mailing list for bug reports.  There is the contact.html page that does document what to do when reporting security issue, but the page does not seem to be linked from other pages (I noticed it thanks to the web site copy bundled in the maradns source tarball).  There's a link from sponsors.html, but that page is no longer linked from the site menu.  So while the info is there, I don't see an easy way to find it by following links from the main page.  Maybe that's something you may want to change.  Just my 2c, HTH.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
