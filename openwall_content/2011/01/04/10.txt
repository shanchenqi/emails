I can confirm that A and B are the two issues mentioned in [2].  >> I admit, this isn't obvious, so let's use for now. >> We can split it if needed once more information is known. > > Josh, since was assigned.

We didn't initially reserve CVEs for these vulnerabilities, but will be happy to update our documentation to reflect them.  (See http://subversion.apache.org/security/ )   The two issues really are orthogonal, so B should probably  not be included in a CVE for A.  I've CC'd dev@...version.apache.org to help coordinate advisory authoring.  -Hyrum  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
