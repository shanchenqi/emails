I can see latest released on Monday, 27-th December [1] http://search.cpan.org/dist/CGI-Simple/  Does it contain fixes for both CVE issues (so it is possible to rebase to new version) or anything else to be done in this part of the world yet?  Is the fix, we were waiting for on the CGI-Simple side: [2]  or yet another one?
