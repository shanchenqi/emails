We're still missing CVE assignments for several issues from These have been requested on oss-security before, but couldn't be  processed by Josh/Red Hat, since RH doesn't have IDs. As such,  they need to be handled by MITRE:  1. Overkill (this should be a ID)  2. Emacs mode for reStructuredText (from DocUtils) (this should be a ID)  3. FireGPG (this should be a ID)  4. Burn (Homepage: http://www.bigpaul.org/burn/) (That's a ID)  5. pdfroff (from GNU groff) (That's a ID)  6. Jetty (That's a ID) http://www.ush.it/team/ush/hack-jetty6x7x/jetty-adv.txt  7. Konversation (That's a ID)  Cheers,         Moritz    Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
