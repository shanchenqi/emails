In both cases, a failure to properly validate indexes into statically-sized arrays on the heap allows a maliciously crafted CDG video to corrupt the heap in a controlled manner, potentially leading to code execution."  -Dan  [1]  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
