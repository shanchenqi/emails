Unless/until there's some formal/semi-formal statement that "CAP_SYS_ADMIN  is equivalent to root in all cases," then these kinds of  privileged-to-privileged issues are within the scope of CVE since they  violate the security model; now, they might receive very low risk scores  because the attacker is already privileged, and I could see how vendors  might reasonably avoid publishing advisories for them, but that doesn't  mean there shouldn't be a CVE assigned to it.  Personally I agree with  Michael that if two cap's/privileges have both "A implies B" and "B  implies A," then one of them doesn't need to exist, but that's irrelevant.  It would be interesting (though I suspect controversial) for someone in  the Linux kernel world to take a stab at more closely defining/defining a  "security policy" regarding capability-to-capability transitions.  (Or  could someone point me to one?)  As a Linux outsider, I like seeing these  kinds of discussions.  - Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
