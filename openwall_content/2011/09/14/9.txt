Crash-only issues are always/typically worth a CVE when it can prevent a  product from working in a security context.  Wireshark monitors network  traffic, sometimes live; therefore, in some reasonable/common usage  scenarios, attackers can cause a crash and prevent network activities from  being detected.  We apply similar logic in forensics and other scenarios.  Therefore a CVE  is needed for both (crash reading live packets) as well  as (by only reading a packet trace file) - in the latter,  analysis of a packet trace could be hampered/delayed because the  investigator can't use the product without it crashing.  Wireshark does not get any more "preference" than any other tool, except  indirectly because it gets more attention.  - Steve    On Wed, 14 Sep Josh Bressers wrote:  > ----- Original Message ----- > >> 2.
