No OVAL script is even tried to be executed: no OVAL file is in the feed and if you/someone copies one into your feed copy it is not being executed because it has no valid signature.  So you need to switch to unsecure mode, then place OVAL files into your feed copy, install ovaldi etc, etc.  Of course the OpenVAS developers will be fixing the problem regardless of the practical relevance!  What frightens me is that a security advisory about OpenVAS 2 (a already deprecated version) made it even into official advisories of CERTs. The review process seems to not work as it should, no one ever checked back wether this version is deprecated. So it should be easy to get faked security alerts about some tools you don't like into official CERT advisories. Or am I getting something wrong here?
