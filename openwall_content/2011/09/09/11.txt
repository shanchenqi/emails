Jan,  Whilst it's not a default compile time configuration option and whilst the  conditions to exploit it are uncommon, the fact remains that there are two  time of check, time of use (TOCTOU) vulnerabilities present in the code.   Calling it fake is disingenous and does OpenVAS no credit.  Whilst a CVE might  be bad, a security project disputing the assignment looks even worse;  especially since one (and the more serious) case was picked up internally.   FWIW, the code concerned was present in trunk so it's not even true to say it  only affects deprecated versions (never mind the fact that just because we no  longer support something doesn't stop someone using it).
