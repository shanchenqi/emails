My current understanding is that both the NetBSD/FreeBSD gzip and GNU gzip reuse code from compress, which was in the public domain.  Those revisions thus could use different licenses (BSD vs. GPL), and indeed the code is quite different by now.  (Also there's a lot of code that is not from compress.)  Tomas, Tim - thank you for explaining the "maxbits < 12" check.  It appears that we don't need it for GNU gzip, and NetBSD/FreeBSD gzip could want to relax the check too.
