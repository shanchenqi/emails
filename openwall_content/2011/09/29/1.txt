As far as I can see, the sanity checks in do not overlap with those in FreeBSD's latest patch.

Thank you!  > FreeBSD went with my patch, which I think was much safer.  Good.  But apparently FreeBSD did not patch even older issues at the same time - obviously, you wouldn't have spotted an issue that was already non-existent in upstream gzip at the time, so you didn't report it to them.  As to who originally added the "maxbits < 12" check, when, and why exactly (and why this value), I still don't know.  In NetBSD, it is added with a commit made 6 weeks ago:  http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/usr.bin/gzip/zuncompress.c?only_with_tag=MAIN  The commit message is merely "Do proper input validation without penalizing performance", and it makes several other changes as well (FreeBSD in fact reused essentially the same patch).  NetBSD's advisory is here:   and it also (correctly) says that NetBSD's gzip was affected.  Joerg - any comments?  For context:  OpenBSD doesn't have gzip since - "Our compress, linked against libz, now does everything gzip does."
