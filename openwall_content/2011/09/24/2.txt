PHP changed how the is_a() function worked, and as a result it could allow for remote arbitrary code execution if certain specific conditions are met (the blog post referenced below has a good writeup of the flaw).   It looks like this is the fix:   Thanks.  --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
