Yes, and that's why it is a very very minor problem. However it was not happening before the code change. The few cases where the class names&co have been sanitize before and the developer did not think about cases like the one describe in the blog post. I think it is even more rare combination, but it was not happening before our change.   --  Pierre  @pierrejoye | http://blog.thepimp.net | http://www.libgd.org  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
