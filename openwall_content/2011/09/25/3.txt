Yes, it is a behavior change, and it shouldn't have happened in 5.3, the  fact that it happened was a bad mistake, it is clear now. However, the security flaw is squarely in the code that a) misuses is_a  b) doesn't have security checks and c) does not follow recommended best  practices about PHP settings. As such, telling people that it was a flaw in PHP and that BC break  reversal "fixed" it only gives them wrong ideas that their code was just  fine. But in fact their code was broken and only by luck (and due to the  haphazard way things were done in PHP where nobody bothered correlating  function signatures with one another) in might have not been  malfunctioning in this specific scenario. They need to fix that code  ASAP, as they can not rely on luck anymore and they way is_a was changed  is actually they way it should have worked from the start and the way  is_subclass_of works right now. --  Stanislav Malyshev, Software Architect SugarCRM: http://www.sugarcrm.com/ ext.
