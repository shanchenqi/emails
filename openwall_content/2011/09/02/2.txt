However, the current shift count is off-by-one, allowing full access to the "negative half" too, via certain hypercalls which ignore virtual-address bits Vulnerable hypercalls exist only in very old versions of the hypervisor.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All systems running a Xen 3.3 or earlier hypervisor with 64-bit PV guests with untrusted administrators are vulnerable.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest administrator on a vulnerable system is able to crash the host.  There are no known further exploits but these have not been ruled out.  RESOLUTION ==========  The attached patch resolves the issue.  Alternatively, users may choose to upgrade to a more recent hypervisor  PATCHES =======  The following patch resolves this issue.  Filename: fix-__addr_ok-limit.patch SHA1:  This patch should apply cleanly, and fix the problem, for all affected versions of Xen.  It is harmless when applied to later hypervisors and will be included in the Xen unstable branch in due course.  VERSION HISTORY ===============  Analysis following version 1 of this advisory (sent out to the predisclosure list during the embargo period) indicates that the actual DoS vulnerability only exists in very old hypervisors, Xen 3.3 and earlier, contrary to previous reports.  This advisory is no longer embargoed. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG (GNU/Linux)  -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  View attachment "fix-__addr_ok-limit.patch" of type "text/plain" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
