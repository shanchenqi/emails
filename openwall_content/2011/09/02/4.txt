Please be so kind to allocate a CVE id for each of the issues detailed below:  1.) Denial of service via improperly validated commands  In multiple places in-game commands are not properly validated that allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.  Vulnerability is present since and will be fixed in the upcoming release. Issue report at  2.) Buffer overflows in savegame loading  In multiple places indices in savegames are not properly validated that allow (remote) attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.  Vulnerability is present since and will be fixed in the upcoming release. Issue reports at and  3.) Multiple buffer overflows in validation of external data  In multiple places external data from the local file system isn't properly checked before allocating memory, which could lead to buffer overflows and arbitrary code execution.  Vulnerability is present since and will be fixed in the upcoming release. Issue reports at and   Once the CVE ids are allocated, each issue will be fully documented at  Thanks, Michael Lutz  [Please CC me, I'm not subscribed.]   Download attachment "signature.asc" of type "application/pgp-signature" bytes)  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
