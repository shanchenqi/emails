Does anyone have any real info on (whose CVE page is in essence completely empty) [1].  BTW, how is a link to the software's homepage considered a confirmation of the issue?  Also, [2] seems to be a rehash of a bunch of CVE ids that happened to be in the recent dump of Mandriva advisories.   Shouldn't this get REJECTED since its just a collection of already known and tracked issues?  Thanks, Mike  [0] [1] [2]  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
