Some trivial bitflipping found a few memory corruption issues.  Originally I didn't think yum used rpm, but i was wrong, rpm-python is a native module wrapper that exports librpm to python. I'll step through the signature verification logic when I get a chance.  Obviously we need the sections of rpm code touched before signature verification to be bulletproof, as most distributions rely on public mirror services that may or may not be trusted. Any volunteers who know crypto better than me appreciated, I'll be primarily looking for memory corruption.
