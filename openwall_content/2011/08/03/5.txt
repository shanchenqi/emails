Can someone assign a CVE id to this? Upstream fix:  The bug: _shttpd_put_dir()/put_dir() function: 26         for (s = p = path + 2; (p = strchr(s, '/')) != NULL; s = ++p) { 27                 len = p - path; 28                 assert(len < sizeof(buf)); 29                 (void) memcpy(buf, path, len); 30                 buf[len] = '\0'; 31 32                 /* Try to create intermediate directory */ 33                 if (_shttpd_stat(buf, &st) == -1 && 34                     _shttpd_mkdir(buf, != 0) 35                         return (-1); 36 37                 /* Is path itself a directory ? */ 38                 if (p[1] == '\0') 39                         return (0); 40         }  The only guard here to avoid a buffer overflow with a long path is the assert call in line 28. Unfortunately this is disabled if you compile with -DNDEBUG and from what I see quite a lot of people are doing that in order to reduce the binary size (those are embedded webservers intended to be used in embedded environments).  It seems quite some projects actually do that, including a deployed product embedded product I'm currently looking at (and that was rooted because of this bug). From what I see -DNDEBUG in the mongoose makefile this is also the default for the mingw binary.  If this is not the case, this is still a DoS bug.
