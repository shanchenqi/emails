Just to clarify, the above was about RHEL gtk2 packages.  For most distros, that implies they don't really need to look at their gtk2 packages if it's fixed in the oldest supported RHEL.  I've not really tried to figure out if there was any upstream gtk2 version that did not have the fix though.  I'm FYI CCing gnome security to reduce the amount of confusion this can possibly cause.
