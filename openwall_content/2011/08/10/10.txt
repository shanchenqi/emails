We've recently came across an issue in commonly re-used LZW decompression implementations - original BSD compress and GIF reader written by David Koblas.  Due to an insufficient input checking, invalid LZW stream can create a loop in the decompression table, leading to the decompression stack buffer overflow.  Following bugzillas list various code bases that were checked for the issue and if they are affected or not:  Many code bases are unaffected as the problem was fixed in the past, so this is probably like N-th re-discovery of the issue.  Some previous fixes were called security some were not.  The problem may not be security relevant, or have much security impact in all currently affected code bases, though please mail the list if you come across any other affected code base that is not already mentioned and that may be worth fixing.  --  Tomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
