This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted WAV file.  2) Boundary errors within the "CSoundFile::ReadS3M()" function (src/load_s3m.cpp) when processing S3M files can be exploited to cause stack-based buffer overflows by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted S3M file.  3) An off-by-one error within the "CSoundFile::ReadAMS()" function (src/load_ams.cpp) can be exploited to cause a stack corruption by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted AMS file.  4) An off-by-one error within the "CSoundFile::ReadDSM()" function (src/load_dms.cpp) can be exploited to cause a memory corruption by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted DSM file.  5) An off-by-one error within the "CSoundFile::ReadAMS2()" function (src/load_ams.cpp) can be exploited to cause a memory corruption by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted AMS file.  Upstream patches are available to correct the flaws  While older gstreamer-plugins contains an embedded copy of libmodplug, it is not yet known to what extent it is affected by these flaws.
