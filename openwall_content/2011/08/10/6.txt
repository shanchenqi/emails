Its marked as a security bug and I guess its not been reclassified. The short of it is  this:  /usr/bin/eu-readelf -l /usr/bin/perf  | grep STACK  If you get RWE for the permissions, its executable. If you get RW, then everything is  fine. While this itself is not exploitable, if there were any other problems then this  could be susceptible to putting shell code on the stack which should have been  banished long ago. IOW, the ease of exploit goes up since you don't need to defeat any  advanced security mechanisms like ASLR.  I have a number of security assessment utilities located here: http://people.redhat.com/sgrubb/security/ that can scan systems looking for problems like this. Some are rpm centric because  once you find a problem you want to know the associated package, but they could be  easily modified for other packaging tools.  -Steve  Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
