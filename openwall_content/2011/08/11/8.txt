If a non-default SSH key is used, the key is stored in this world-readable file (~/.qtnx/*.nxml) in a world-readable directory (~/.qtnx/).  Could a CVE be assigned to this please?   --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
