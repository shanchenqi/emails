Would it be possible to issue a CVE for a new crash in Pidgin?  "Certain characters in the nicknames of IRC users can trigger a null pointer dereference in the IRC protocol plugin's handling of responses to WHO requests. This can cause a crash on some operating systems. Clients based on libpurple through are affected." http://pidgin.im/news/security/?id=53  The crash was discovered by Djego Ibanez.
