These are the bugs that affect upstream code; please assign CVEs as you feel appropriate:  dtc saves the administrator password in plain text in /var/lib/dtc/saved_install_config under the variable name conf_adm_pass. It remains there even after initial configuration.  dtc-xen includes several command executions as root that use unchecked user input in dtc-soap-server.  dtc stores user passwords and passwords for various services in unencrypted form in the database.  Insufficient input checking in /shared/inc/sql/lists.php  The setup script for dtc writes the password for the MySQL user in the world-readable file /etc/apache2/apache2.conf.  Insufficient input checking leads to a SQL injection vulnerability in shared/inc/forms/domain_info.php.  A SQL injection vulnerability in logPushlet.php can overwrite arbitrary files as the MySQL system user.  dtc passes passwords to htpasswd using command line arguments, which can be read by a local user.  dtc does not escape variables in HTML output in many places; for example in the "Domain root TXT record:" field on the "DNS and MX" page where JavaScript can be injected.  Note that these descriptions are mostly taken from the bug reports and may not be suitable for direct publication without editing. I have checked as far as possible that none of these were previously assigned CVEs but they could be duplicates. There are often mitigating factors such as user or administrator authentication.
