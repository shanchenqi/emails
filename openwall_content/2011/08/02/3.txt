Tomas Hoger EDT  GDK's GIF image reader is based on David Koblas' code that is also used in several other GIF image readers.  This code contained an input validation flaw.  Input code size was read from input GIF file and used to initialize decoding tables without checking the value, leading to buffer overflow.  Relevant GDK code is:    static int   gif_prepare_lzw (GifContext *context)   {     ...     if (!gif_read (context, &(context->lzw_set_code_size), 1)) {         /*g_message (_("GIF: EOF / read error on image data\n"));*/         return -1;     }     ...     context->lzw_clear_code = 1 << context->lzw_set_code_size;     ...     for (i = 0; i < context->lzw_clear_code; ++i) {         context->lzw_table[0][i] = 0;         context->lzw_table[1][i] = i;     }  The same flaw was previously reported for several other components that include GIF reading code based on David Koblas' parser, such as: gd SDL_image tk netbpm cups  This problem was corrected upstream long ago:   The fix can be found in all gdk-pixbuf versions embedded in gtk2 packages, but it seems it never got it to stand-alone gdk-pixbuf version for gtk+ 1.x.  Gimp corrected this bug ~2 years after GDK:   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
