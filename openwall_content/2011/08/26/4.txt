The  greeter object inside the daemon creates PAMSession objects which  attempt to be authenticated, then passes the successful one to the  session code which starts the PAM session.  Might just be bad naming  causing confusion?  (I've been meaning to split this into  PAMAuthentication and PAMSession objects).  --Robert   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
