Would something like:  diff --git a/src/dmrc.c b/src/dmrc.c index --- a/src/dmrc.c +++ b/src/dmrc.c @@ @@ dmrc_save (GKeyFile *dmrc_file, const gchar *username)      /* Update the users .dmrc */      if (user)      { +      /* write the file as the user itself */ +      pid_t pid; +      pid = fork(); + +      if (pid == 0) +      { +        if (setuid (user_get_uid(user)) < 0) +        { +          g_warning("Error changing uid for %s: %s", username, g_strerror(errno)); +          _exit(EXIT_FAILURE); +        }          path = g_build_filename (user_get_home_directory (user), ".dmrc", NULL);          g_file_set_contents (path, data, length, NULL); -        if (getuid () == 0 && chown (path, user_get_uid (user), user_get_gid (user)) < 0) -            g_warning ("Error setting ownership on %s: %s", path, strerror (errno));          g_free (path); +        _exit(EXIT_SUCCESS); + +      } +      if (pid > 0) +        wait(NULL);      }        /* Update the .dmrc cache */  do the job (untested, it's more like a RFC right now).
