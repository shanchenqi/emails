You are being emailed as the upstream contact. Please keep oss-security@...ts.openwall.com[1] CC'd for any updates on this issue.  This issue should be considered public and has not yet been assigned a CVE.  Details from the public bug follow:  ---- From the reporter:  "hammerhead blindly writes to to /tmp/hammer.log without prior checks. It is possible to put a symbolic link at /tmp/hammer.log pointing at another file - that hammerhead will then end up appending data into. (it appears that hammerhead uses the file location as specified in /etc/hammerhead/hh.conf - which in debian/ubuntu is /tmp/hammer.log)." ----  A quick check shows that HH_LOG and REPORT_LOG are indeed being unconditionally opened with 'fopen(..., "a+")' in src/hammerhead.cc.
