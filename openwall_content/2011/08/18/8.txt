It's in perl and the Encode module:   ! Unicode/Unicode.xs    Addressed the following:      Date: Fri, 22 Jul      From: Robert Zacek <zacek@...st.com>      To: perl5-security-report@...l.org      Subject: Unicode.xs!decode_xs n-byte heap-overflow  It's been fixed in perl:   Seems to be in all versions of perl since  There isn't really information on the impact of this though.  I don't know enough to determine whether this is something that can cause arbitrary code execution, whether some gcc/glibc hardening prevents or minimizes the impact, whether it's a crash-only, etc.  It has been asked on the perl5-porters list, but no response was given:   Does anyone know anything more about this flaw?  Could a CVE be assigned to it as well?  Thanks.  --  Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
