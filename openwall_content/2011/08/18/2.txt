OVERVIEW  WebsiteBaker and lower versions are vulnerable to Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF).   2. BACKGROUND  WebsiteBaker is a PHP-based Content Management System (CMS) designed with one goal in mind: to enable its users to produce websites with ease.   3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION  WebsiteBaker and lower versions contain a flaw that allows a remote Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF / XSRF) attack. The flaw exists because the application does not require multiple steps or explicit confirmation for sensitive transactions for majority of administrator functions such as adding new user. By using a crafted URL, an attacker may trick the victim into visiting to his web page to take advantage of the trust relationship between the authenticated victim and the application. Such an attack could trick the victim into executing arbitrary commands in the context of their session with the application, without further prompting or verification.   4. VERSIONS AFFECTED  <=   5. PROOF-OF-CONCEPT/EXPLOIT  The following request adds an administrator.  [REQUEST] POST /admin/users/add.php HTTP/1.1 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length:  [/REQUEST]   6. SOLUTION  Upgrade to or higher   7. VENDOR  WebsiteBaker Org e.
