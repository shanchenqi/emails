Since it's pretty clear there are two  implementations (due to 2 different languages, and 2 upstream  maintainers), we treated these as separate codebases and went with two  separate CVEs.  (You could argue this was the same core design problem,  but this issue wasn't due to a protocol that required such behavior.)
