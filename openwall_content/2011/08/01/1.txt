Hi Josh,  As patches are either being worked on currently or finished for the various affected products that we're aware of, I think we'll get those committed, give the packagers a 48-hour heads-up, and then we'll just put the details on this list. Then you can assign CVEs as appropriate and we can reference those in the various security advisories.  Does that sound good?
