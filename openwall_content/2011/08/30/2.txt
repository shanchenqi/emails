However, the current shift count is off-by-one, allowing full access to the "negative half" too, via certain hypercalls which ignore virtual-address bits   As a result, a malicious guest administrator on a vulnerable system is able to crash the host.  Upstream status:  This issue only affects very old hypervisors, Xen 3.3 and earlier.
