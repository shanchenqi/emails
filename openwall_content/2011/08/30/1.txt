Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org> Subject: kernel:  sctp DoS This does not affect the upstream kernel. Our kernel left out a chunk of upstream that was not needed at the time of the backport, but was later required for a feature that we introduced in the kernel.   xen: x86_emulate: fix SAHF emulation This has been addressed in the upstream xen implementation. The patched code would cause a hypervisor crash due to dereferencing a bogus address (in the first 4 MBs of address space, as EFLAGS bits above bit 21 are always 0, but more likely in the first page).
