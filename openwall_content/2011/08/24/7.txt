There is a lot of uid 0 code creating and chown()ing files in user dirs such as for ~/.dmrc and ~/.Xauthority. Probably more, depending on how the permissions of cache and log directories are set up. For example process_start() also creates and chown()s logfiles on users behalf.  There is also one thing that I dont understand about the lightdm user itself and why pam sessions seem to be started for it inside the greeter session code.  The xdmcp code seems to be OK so far, after a quick review.  l8er, -s   --   ~ perl self.pl ~ ~ krahmer@...e.de - SuSE Security Team  --- SUSE LINUX Products GmbH, GF: Jeff Hawn, Jennifer Guild, Felix Imendörffer, HRB (AG Nürnberg) Maxfeldstraße 5 Nürnberg Germany   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
