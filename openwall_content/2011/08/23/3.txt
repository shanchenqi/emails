It is installed with file caps in this case. (and a lot of caps indeed, so actually you have almost all caps distributed across the binaries). Particular interesting of course is cap_dac_override and it looks like most lxc- binaries are not really prepared to handle such cases:  linux:~> /sbin/getcap /usr/local/bin/lxc-start /usr/local/bin/lxc-start = cap_dac_override,cap_fowner,cap_setpcap,\ cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw,cap_sys_chroot,cap_sys_admin+ep linux:~> /usr/local/bin/lxc-start -n foo -c /etc/foo /usr/bin/id lxc-start: failed to spawn 'foo' linux:~> ls -la /etc/foo -rw------- 1 jim users 0 Aug 23 /etc/foo linux:~>  That means you have a trivial root exploit if lxc is installed for users. There is a lxc-setuid script too but I guess that the lxc binaries are similarily not intended for such use. I dont know whether any distributor ships lxc with file caps, but probably the tools need some hardening if you want to allow lxc for users at all. I checked the latest version.  regards, Sebastian   --   ~ perl self.pl ~ ~ krahmer@...e.de - SuSE Security Team  --- SUSE LINUX Products GmbH, GF: Jeff Hawn, Jennifer Guild, Felix Imendörffer, HRB (AG Nürnberg) Maxfeldstraße 5 Nürnberg Germany   Powered by blists - more mailing lists  Please check out the  Open Source Software Security Wiki, which is counterpart to this mailing list.
