While there are issues that were discovered, I am claiming that some of what you see below shouldn't be in the list.

That's not more a security vulnerability than /etc/mysql/debian.cnf (both file are readable by root only). This has been in the BTS for a long time, and it makes no sense to assign a CVE now.  > > dtc-xen includes several command executions as root that use unchecked > user input in dtc-soap-server.  That's not relevant and isn't a vulnerability. I have closed the bug a long time ago, writing that I wont fix it, and explaining why. Please see the BTS entry for it. dtc-xen isn't supposed to run stand-alone, and the only client for dtc-xen is dtc itself. If you gain access to it, then there is an issue somewhere else, and "fixing" things here wont make things better.  > > dtc stores user passwords and passwords for various services in unencrypted > form in the database.  This is fixed in the Git, and has already been discussed. While it's a serious issue (which has been carefully worked on), it didn't deserve a CVE 6 months ago, and it shouldn't right now.  > > Insufficient input checking in /shared/inc/sql/lists.php > > > The setup script for dtc writes the password for the MySQL user in the > world-readable file /etc/apache2/apache2.conf. >  > > Insufficient input checking leads to a SQL injection vulnerability in > shared/inc/forms/domain_info.php. >  > > A SQL injection vulnerability in logPushlet.php can overwrite arbitrary > files as the MySQL system user. >  > > dtc passes passwords to htpasswd using command line arguments, which can be > read by a local user. >  > > dtc does not escape variables in HTML output in many places; for example > in the "Domain root TXT record:" field on the "DNS and MX" page where > JavaScript can be injected.  The above should be fixed and are real issues, but what I commented don't deserve a CVE.  > Note that these descriptions are mostly taken from the bug reports and may > not be suitable for direct publication without editing.
